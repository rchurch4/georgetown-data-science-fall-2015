"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I really enjoy this restaurant when I visit Nashville.The menu is HUGE, so it might take a while to determine what you want to eat. It's an awesome meal, whatever you get. Always try something new!!! Keep in mind that if you want cheesecake, take home some of your food...as the portions are massive. The cheesecakes are to die for...but what would you expect? It is a little expensive, but if you go at lunch, they do have lunch portions for most of their dishes. You also get bread with your meal. It's a great place to take a date!! I highly recommend this restaurant.",The Cheesecake Factory,6154632400,34 reviews,2015-06-05,"Bowling Green, KY",/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville,5.0,160,"Washington, DC",Brandon P.
"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"Called ahead to place an order. Was put on hold. Arrived at the restaurant ten minutes later still on hold. Just for fun, kept the call going until at 11 minutes and 21 seconds the hostess looks down, says ""oops"" and disconnects the call. In her defense they were very busy, there must have been nearly 30 people in the restaurant with no wait and it was only two hours before closing time.

"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I came to this location because it was closer to get a to-go order before work tonight. To start off the first time I called I waited on the phone for over 5 minutes before I decided to hang up and call again. Upon calling again I was on the phone for almost another 5 minutes before someone responded. Granted the lady over the phone was nice and helpful. When I arrived I informed the lady at the front desk that I had a to-go order. And she was very rude as she pointed to the counter on my right with her face scrunched up, saying its over there. When I approached the desk I told the lady my order she printed my ticket and instead of handing me a pen to sign the receipt she made me reach over someone else's bag to grab a pen. Let's just say I won't be visiting this location again since people don't believe in friendly customer service.",The Cheesecake Factory,6154632400,3 reviews,2015-10-10,"Nashville, TN",/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville,1.0,160,"Washington, DC",Heather R.
"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"My husband and I grabbed dinner here the other night about 8-8:30 PM. A week night btw. Were seated fairly quickly. Some of the service was slightly slow throughout the night...but, that's getting really nitpicky. My Chateau St. Michelle was fine, and my husband enjoyed his martini.       He had fish tacos and loved them. I ordered the sliders off of the appetizer menu, with a side of fries. Four mini burgers came. I had my choice of cheese. It was good, the fries were good. I wouldn't say great about any of it, but good. We both really enjoyed the soft, brown bread. Not so much the other one!

"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"Holy moly do we have one of these in Memphis? Because this place was AMAAAAZING! I met up with my friend and her parents here. Her parents were eating with friends so she got a nearby booth for the three of us. I had never been here before but I had just eaten lunch with my mom and grandma so I wasn't that hungry. I ordered an entree and hubby ordered hot chocolate and a dessert and we split them both.I really loved the bread they brought to the table- wheat and white loaves. I definitely preferred the wheat, as did my friend. My waitress was named Becky and she was amazing. I asked for the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta with angel hair pasta instead of penne. They brought out penne and let me eat it while they corrected the mistake. I have to admit, penne was easier to eat. The meal itself is kind of soupy or wet so the angel hair pasta made it a messy meal. I will stick with penne next time! Becky let me keep both (yay!). Onto the entree itself. The flavor of the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta was amazing. However, most of the pieces of chicken in it were gristle and I didn't eat them. But the rest of it was great and it made great leftovers. Hubby and I were totally going to share the leftovers but ended up devouring it ourselves the next day instead. The Dulce de Leche Hot Chocolate was so excellent my hubby only let me have a few sips before drinking it all himself. I wasn't as impressed with the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake but it was good as well. When we came a second time I was excited to see a Thai-themed dinner dish, Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp so I got it (with brown rice!). I definitely prefer it with chicken and it's much better fresh.  I love the flavors. I liked it better fresh though as it just didn't taste as good as leftovers.

"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"Another chain but a good one because of the LARGE menu. We love the sampler appetizer and have ordered it more than a few times and to go. The chicken avocado egg rolls are amazing and the grilled artichokes are also very very tasty. The Tuna Tartare is very good but really not worth it unless you NEED tuna tartare. Everything we have ordered has been consistently good. Shrimp Scampi, Steak, Angela's pasta, Burrito, Salads. The only question is what cheesecake to order. We sometimes don't eat that after the meal, but one should get a slice to take home. You really have to. The parking is mall parking and valet.

I ordered the grilled chicken tostada salad, and when the waiter asked if I wanted the full portion, I replied ""of course.""  I shan't make that mistake again.The salad was amazing, but I have never before ordered a salad that I couldn't finish.  They started with a massive platter and loaded it to overflowing.  My wife really enjoyed her shrimp tacos, but she also had more food than she could finish.  So neither one of us had room for the cheesecake.The menu is a book.  Seriously.  They have so many items that it was difficult to figure out what we wanted.  Bookmarks would have been helpful.  We were seated right beside a server station, and we spent the entire meal with waiters and waitresses literally standing over us.  At one point we had two people standing beside us and another standing right behind me, and I felt like I was back in a submarine mess deck.This was my first experience dining at the Cheesecake Factory.  If we do go back to Green Hills, I'm more likely to pick up some cheesecake to take home than dining there again.",The Cheesecake Factory,6154632400,282 reviews,2014-12-16,"Hendersonville, TN",/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville,3.0,160,"Washington, DC",Larry S.
"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,Bad service and the food too salty. Me and my husband went there for his birthday. I was so sorry for him. Bad birthday for him ever. I wasn't mean to give that bad tip for the waitress. Guess what happened me and my husband ordered 2 steak. The steak too salty then he told the waitress and she said let she bring it to the back and tell the chef wash all the sauce off and put the sauce separate and the manager gave us more bread without butter. How can we eat that?. But what my husband received only that steak washes and over cook without any sauce. Then the dinner ended up pretty bad. When we walked out. The waitress didn't look at us and said any thanks. We ended up with the total $80 with $1.50 tip. We always give the good tip like 30% or more.

"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I give it 3 stars for 3 specific reasons.1. This restaurant would get 4 stars if it was not for the last time my boyfriend and I went. The steak was asked to be cooked medium but it was cooked well done. (The steak Diane was recommended by our waitress who was actually amazing and reminded me of Piper for O is the new B) The chicken was too dry and the mashed potatoes didn't taste fresh. Also, the Cajun Jumbalaya Pasta I always order was dry and lacked sauce. 2. I understand it is a chain restaurant and it's busy during dinner time but do I have to wait 20 minutes for the waitress to come go my table after the hostess sat us? We went through 3 different waitresses until we finally were able to order our food! 3. We paid $13 for 3 small spring rolls as an appetizer. The portions are ridiculously small for the price. Their dinner entrees are a generous amount but again, my food came out unappetizing. If you choose an appetizer, their fried calamari is bomb! However, their cheesecake is to die for. It is hands down the best cheesecake I have ever put in my mouth! If you go here to try it out, I recommend going during lunch time or before the dinner rush. Don't be alarmed with the bad reviews but do take caution and the worst that could happen is you getting a over cooked steak or dry pasta!

"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"Visited the Cheesecake Factory in the Green Hills Mall in Nashville, TN. Sunday night wait time was around 30 min so it wasn't too terrible. And we busied ourselves by wandering through the shops close by. Seated, ordered 4 waters, and got our bread without any hesitation or anything of note. We ordered our food (4 cheese pasta with chicken, Skinnylicious chicken pasta, and I can't remember what the other two in our group got.) and it came out pretty promptly. The servings are large, but the chicken in my pasta might've amounted up to a half of a chicken breast if I'm honest. My girlfriend wasn't overly happy about about her pasta either because it looked more like a bowl full of diced tomatoes with a smattering of pasta noodles. To me it was not worth the $17 for mine, or for hers. But, they were alright. Then we went onto dessert. I'm a sucker for a classic cheesecake. No strawberries, no cherries, no sauce. Plain ol' cheesecake. My girlfriend on the other hand, is not the cheesecake connoisseur that I consider myself. She got the Oreo cheesecake, and when it was all over, it looked like someone had murdered a pack of oreos and whipped cream on her plate. We were happier with dessert than the meal, but even with that, I don't feel it was quite worth the $50 plus tip that the bill came out to.",The Cheesecake Factory,6154632400,37 reviews,2014-12-22,"Somerville, AL",/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville,3.0,160,"Washington, DC",James L.

My husband and I decided to dine here one evening and we brought along our kids 6 and 12. The wait was normal on your typical weekend so that was not an issue. Where my issue lies is wear and how we were seated. We were seated all the way in the back close to the kitchen, as well as other African American's who were dining, along side Caucasian families who you could tell was not from that demographic area or (zip code) if you catch my drift. All of the servers for us in the ""back"" we're African American as well. While taking my youngest to rest room she noticed the front of the restaurant was seated with nothing but Caucasian people. It was bad enough when my husband and I caught on to what was going on, but what made it even worse was when both of my children noticed what was going on as well.

"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I'm going to preface this post with the fact that I used to work at this location and have ventured into a different career path. Some of the reviews on this thread are absolutely ridiculous and a true representation of the very impatient and extremely ungrateful society that the service industry deals with on a daily basis. Some of you people need to get yourselves a nice membership to Sam's Club and stay home. That aside, let's address some of these issues:Wait Time- Yes, I know it's insane that one of the top-grossing Cheesecake Factories in the nation has upwards of two hours wait time on a Saturday night. You know what's even crazier? The fact that you're handed a pager when you enter the building and the nice hostess at the front TELLS you this information and you STILL decide to wait. You know what you could do in 2 hours? You could COOK YOUR OWN FOOD. It's a novel idea, I know. This is not to stray people from eating at this location but you have to understand that your server does not have control over how long you waited for the table. So many times I would have a couple or a group sit at my table after waiting an hour and they had the nerve to be angry with ME?! It makes it really hard for a server to give you a good experience when your response to ""How are you all doing this evening?"" is ""WE WAITED AN HOUR- WE ARE HUNGRY!"" How rude. Please also understand that the hostess is not a magician. She cannot predict down to the minute how long a table is going to sit at their table before it becomes available so be gracious if you have a large party- I guarantee they're always working to get you in as fast as possible. Food Quality- Cheesecake Factory prides themselves on the fact that essentially every dish is ""homemade."" Have you ever accidentally undercooked something when you were cooking at home? Have you ever burnt something? I bet you have. Same goes for a restaurant. We have a ""last line of defense"" tactic that we try to use before food leaves the kitchen but because we are a very fast-paced restaurant, we sometimes miss things. Simply notify your server and they will get a new dish working for you as quickly as they can. They do not cook your food so yelling at them for the way your dish comes out is not going to solve anything. That's essentially like yelling at your child for the way your husband cooked the hamburgers. And believe me, they're upset your food isn't right- the longer you sit at their table, the less money they make. Cramped Tables- Again, your server didn't create the layout of the restaurant. Yes, the bar tables are close together- they are the same way in almost every other CCF you go to. No one in the restaurant created the layout- the big guys at the top created it so instead of complaining, maybe strike up a conversation with the people next to you. Temperature- Someone said it was cold in the restaurant. I apologize we cannot accommodate everyone's preferred temperature. Sweaters are a thing. Racist Seating- When I read the review about the way the restaurant is sat, I had to keep my insides from falling out because I was laughing so hard. You're absolutely right- a restaurant with a 2 hour wait has plenty of time to strategically sit the ""black"" people in the back and the ""white"" people in the front. From what I've heard from the staff at this location (who are very aware of all of the reviews on this page) that evening there was a Chris Brown concert. Now, from a logic standpoint, because Chris Brown is an african-american artist, he probably has a large african-american fanbase. Because you often attend concerts with friends, this would also mean you eat dinner with your friends- as a group. The only part of this restaurant that accommodates groups is the BACK of the restaurant. Please get over yourself and stop thinking the world is out to get you. We don't have time or patience to seat by color and I feel dumber for having read your review. Slow Service- I can actually attest that the service can be slow at times. This restaurant can do upwards of $27,000 in sales on some nights. This means that everything can get a little backed up. The bar is serving the servers, the guests at the bar, and the patrons who are drinking while they wait for tables. Drinks, especially alcoholic, can take some time. As far as bread service goes, bread is not served automatically anymore as we are trying to conserve as a restaurant. Your server will (or should) always ask if you want bread AFTER they take your order. You can always ask for it. Also, if it's not hot, they'll always be happy to get you warm bread but they have to wait until the next batch is out or take the time to stick your bread in the oven which can be very hard if they're busy. Just be patient. Servers are humans too. We are not magicians that can just make things happen at the drop of a hat. Overall, this restaurant is amazing. If you want a great experience, you have to positively engage with your server.",The Cheesecake Factory,6154632400,3 reviews,2015-05-27,"Nashville, TN",/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville,5.0,160,"Washington, DC",Nashville K.

"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"How on earth does the Cheesecake Factory get rated so low? I'm a huge fan of the Cheesecake Factory and I admit I'm biased. I can only imagine that Nashville locals aren't appreciative of the super delicious dishes that CK Factory is legendary for. I'm speculating here; Southern pallets prefer a down home cooked styled meal. Either that or the locals aren't fan of the 20 plus minutes of waiting required before seating. Maybe it's the crowd that CKF draws. I mean people pack the booths and tables often. It can get quite a busy. Call ahead if you can to avoid the major buzz kill when you arrive. If you're in a party you may want someone to scout ahead, get there early and reserve a a table or two. If this is your first time to the CKF you may suffer sticker shock. Word to the wise, prepare for a bill of at least $60 for a couple not including drinks. If you're comfortable with that price tag then you're in for a great meal. Newbies should be wisely advised to save room for dessert. Hard to do cause CKF always off generous portions. The entrée are spectacular but the deserts are what makes you a believer.

The restaurant itself is beautiful. The food entree I ordered was not good at all. I ordered the cheese pasta (not sure the technical name for it from the menu). The taste was really bad. More like just all marinara and no cheese, except for the blob of ricotta in the middle. I am not one to complain in restaurants, so I ate what few bites I could put down and that was it.  The pro: the cheesecake I ordered was out of this world!! Dulce (some type of caramel). I have been dreaming about it since I ate it! Its delicious!  Regarding staff dress code: they look dirty! At least their clothes and shoes. And I'm not talking about hygiene. Look at those workers shoes! What should be white is nasty and dirty! Makes me wonder how clean the kitchen is, because I know that is where most of their traffic is too. How about this...wouldn't it be better (I know it would look better) for the hostesses (who don't get dirty) to wear white? And the servers to wear black?

"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"After waiting 1.5 hours, (as expected on a Saturday evening), the two of us were sat at a small table in the corner of the bar uncomfortably close to another couple. Our waiter, (whose name was never even divulged), approached our table in a hastily manner and greeted us with, ""What's going on here""? Puzzled by his abrupt greeting we replied in confusion that we'd like to start with the Warm Crab & Artichoke dip. I understand Saturday nights are hectic and the restaurant is extremely busy, however I did not find it appropriate to hasten our dining experience due to their inability to cater to multiple parties simultaneously.As our appetizer arrived and before we even took one bite, our server came out to tell us that it was a, ""23 minute ticket"", and that our entrees were already prepared. He asked us if we wanted it anymore to which we declined & requested our entrees. He proceeded to take our appetizer away, then returned with it saying it was on the house. One bite in, and I see something shiny hanging off my partner's cracker. It was dimly lit so I assumed it was a cheese strand, later to discover it was a blonde hair. Neither myself, nor my partner has blonde hair. As we showed our waiter, his response was, ""Good thing it was on the house"". I was appalled at his response to say the least.Our entrees arrived, and were delicious as expected. Approximately mid-way through our final course I noticed what I thought was a small fly on the wall directly next to my face. I asked my partner what it was, he replied, ""it's just as fly"". As I blew air at it in an attempt to make it disperse, it only crawled closer and closer towards me. I ripped a piece of napkin from the bread basket and squished the bug from the wall and threw it on a used appetizer plate on our table for closer examination. To our horror, it was a baby cockroach. At this point my meal and complete dining experience at Cheesecake Factory was utterly ruined.Our server got one of the managers, Jose, and he offered us free cheesecake (which I was not sure I even wanted), and to comp our entire meal, (water, an uneaten appetizer, two half eaten entrees, and a slice of cheesecake to go). He also ensured us that the restaurant gets, ""bombed"" every month and that the next scheduled was the upcoming week. I understand completely that a fine establishment such as Cheesecake Factory would have such a long wait time on the busiest day of the week. With this understanding however, I am unsure as to why the staff is not properly trained, or adequate enough to accommodate these conditions. I also comprehend that poor timing, accidents, and uninvited creatures can happen. What is baffling to me is how ALL of these mishaps occurred in ONE night, to ONE dining party. I cannot imagine what that says about the restaurant as a whole. I was more disappointed than angry about the entire experience as I waited 1.5 hours for my anticipated delicious meal to be dissolved into a horrible nightmare and an empty stomach.",The Cheesecake Factory,6154632400,5 reviews,2014-01-07,"Brentwood, TN",/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville,1.0,160,"Washington, DC",Kristen C.

"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I like this place, it's certainly the best option at the Mall at Green Hills. I'm from out of town so when I visit this mall, the food court options have no appeal to me (I can have Chick-fil-A at home, thanks) so I try to pick places I can't have back home. Thus, when I'm there I go for Cheesecake Factory.To be technical, I'd probably give them a 3.5/5 - they're not awful, but they don't live up to the hype nearly as much as they should, given whenever you go there's always a wait. I mean hey, good for them to not be hurting for business, but it sucks when you're on a time crunch and don't have time to wait 20 minutes to be seated, especially when it usually ends up being 30-35 minutes in a tiny, cramped space where there's never enough seats and always too many antsy kids. But hey, the waiting area is never that big in restaurants.But the noise level of the restaurant is ridiculous. The acoustics suck (and do in all locations, I've been to others) and it causes everyone to echo, giving it a noisy, cafeteria-like atmosphere. Hardly the upscale-but-still-kinda-casual vibe they're going for.Other than that though, it's not bad. They have some of the best lemonade I've ever had. Most restaurants offer crappy Minute Maid, so it's nice to get it at places like this where it's freshly squeezed, and the sugar rimmed glasses are a nice touch.The menu is just ridiculous, in both a good and bad way. Especially on your first visit it's just plain overwhelming, and there's some stuff that's just not that good. Though some of what I've had is great:- The American Kobe burger sucks. Save the money and get a regular burger. The meat doesn't taste any different and isn't any more tender than a burger you'd get at Chili's.+ Chicken and biscuits are good. Their biscuits are a shortcake batter so they're interesting, and their gravy's good, though I'm sure it's pre-made.- The fish and chips suck. They're frozen, for starters. And for someone who's had authentic fish and chips overseas, wrapped in newspaper...it's a huge disappointment.+ The crab cake is good. I don't get it, but someone I go with usually does who's from the Maryland area originally so it must be okay.I've only had their cheesecake once since the portions are so huge. I can never make room for it. But the serving of cheesecake is small, far smaller than the cheesecake I've had anywhere else. It was good though, I just can't remember if I tried the key lime or the vanilla bean cheesecake. Maybe I've had both, but regardless their cheesecake is good.

"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I like the Cheesecake Factory for it's plethora of options. The joke being their menu is so huge they have to take out ads to support the printing costs. And, impressively, for a place that has American, Italian, Mexican, Japanese and more, they do it all quite well.Portions are huge, bread is really good, and desserts are worth skipping the main course.That being said, the wait at Cheesecake Factory's gotten to the point that we avoid it. Weekends, you can face a 90+ minute wait - and that was even for a table for 2. Brunch, Lunch and Dinner, the waits are getting to be a little crazy - the best times are off-peak times or weekdays. The last time we tried, we waited for an hour and 45 minutes and were told it may be another 10-15 minutes... I ended up handing off my pager to another couple who had just arrived, and my wife and I went elsewhere.So while the food is good, it lately has not been good enough to warrant the wait.Update:Wanting to give them another shot, I tried again on a Tuesday at 6:30. We were told it would be a half hour. An hour and 15 minutes later, we were told we were at the top of the list and just needed a table to free up. The manager said he would do a quick walk-around to see if any tables were clearing up, and finally after waiting about an hour and 20 minutes, we had our table. While the manager was apologetic, and even offered a complimentary appetizer, it's incredible to have waited almost 3 times the estimate we were given.

"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I think The Cheesecake Factory is riding on their reputation amongst wannabe ""foodies"" that they are the last good chain restaurant. I say this because, at least at this location, cleanliness and other such ""surface"" issues seem to be taking a backseat because they know people will still file in by the dozen and pay the over-priced cost of their meals. During my most recent visit, our table was not wiped down properly before we were seated as there were obvious crumbs on the table. The service was decent but a bit too clingy and earnest. The menu, as always, is almost overwhelming with choices but the majority of the entrees here are really good which makes up, for most people, for everything else. The Cheesecake is the big draw, but while I have never had a bad piece of cheesecake here, I don't find it so special that it is necessarily worth the price or the calories.

Many times I was taking my last sip and bam - another glass was right there.  I was impressed!We ordered our food and when it came - there were 2 problems.  First, my friend's order was wrong and second - the fries that came with my buffalo chicken sandwich were cold.  Like, not even the slightest bit warm.  Here comes the part where I was really impressed - the manager, without prompting from us, came to our table with a new plate for my roomie, realizing that the order was wrong.  I'm guessing perhaps two people ordered the same thing and they sent the wrong plate to our table.  in defense of Cheesecake factory - he ordered a dish with chicken and shrimp and asked for just chicken.  It came with both...so, it's not the way it's traditionally served.  But, they had the correct order on the table just moments after the 'wrong' one arrived.  Nice!I never did complain about my fries because, after all, I was just here trying to spend a gift card and I'd likely never come back anyway.  So, I was afraid if I complained they might take it off my order and then I'd be left with more money to spend...and I didn't want that.All in all - the service was impressive, the food was blah and the cheesecake was, of course, incredible.  If you want a good place to eat in Nashville - this is NOT it.  If you want a place to get a good piece of cheesecake - by all means - stop by.  I really do wish that server the best, though.  He was incredible.  But, other than the cheesecake and the service - I have never, ever found a reason, food wise, to return.  The food is overpriced and of mediocre quality.  The food seems very chain-like and corporate.  AKA - nothing to write home about.  But, if you fit one of the 6 reasons above to go - by all means...Just be expected to wait.",The Cheesecake Factory,6154632400,86 reviews,2013-05-07,"Nashville, TN",/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville,3.0,160,"Washington, DC",Joshua B.
"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I'm not quite sure why... but this place is packed. All the time. The food isn't bad and the cheesecake is actually pretty darn good, but I refuse to wait longer than 15 minutes for average chain restaurant food. It's the kind of place that literally has EVERYTHING so picky eaters will have lots of options to chose from. I do appreciate the ""skinnylicious"" menu (though I'll admit to feeling pretty stupid using the name when I order from it.) Cost: A glass of wine & the skinnylicious pear and endive salad (including tip) is $29. Tips: Portions are enormous and entrees can easily be shared.

"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,Cheesecake was awesome but the rest of the experience was a little lame. I'm always instantly nervous when I see big fake columns and murals painted on the ceiling. I was right... This place was as pretentious as it looked.  The menu was overly large..almost too much to take in.  There was everything from salads and burgers to wannabe fine dining dishes.  The wait staff were overly fussy .. it was just an expensive average quality meal trying very hard to punch above its weight.

"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I'd love to see Gordon Ramsay eat at a Cheesecake Factory. I'm sure he'd rip it a new butt-hole for it's super-huge menu of average food. And I'd love to take a tour of their kitchen....the quality of some of the produce I've received has been questionable.It's average if you're lucky. Most of the time it's this side of cafeteria food. The fish and chips is a good example. I think you get better from Gordon's in the frozen food aisle. Pros include the wait staff dress like they're ship stewards. If you look up, you'll notice how tall and useless looking the ceiling is. The drinks taste fine, although they're incredibly expensive. Getting wasted here is not cost effective. I hesitate to say this, as it might cause a lemming like exodus to the restaurants that aren't as busy, but (never mind). Carraba's completely blows now and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.

"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I've been to several locations of the Cheesecake Factory in California. Each time, the wait was long, the menu was extensive, and the portions are huge.I came in fully expecting the above and this place did not disappoint.I love their menu and I love how big the place is.I know better than to come in during lunchtime. But, work closed at noon, and I had to give this place a try since I was in the area. The place was predictably packed. People who got their pagers were all milling around in the wait area or in the chairs in the foyer.  I was told my wait time was 20 minutes. In actuality, it was more half an hour.  But I've waited up to 2 hours before at the Sacramento location during 3PM, way after a lunch rush.I've been craving Mexican, so I had their green chile burger. It was okay. The fries were crispy. And the Snickers cheesecake was awesome. They use a lot of whipped cream to top the cheesecake -- there was more volume of whipped cream than cheesecake.Service was very attentive. I like how they offer you bread and butter while you wait for your meal. A weird thing happened to me when I was here. I dropped my knife and the women at the table next to me didn't even offer to pick it up for me to refuse them to do so. No acknowledgment even though the knife made a loud noise. I've never experienced aloof, unhelpful strangers before. This must be the snotty rich I have only read about. Perhaps they expected the wait staff to pick it up for me.

"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"So a friend suggested that we go to The Cheesecake Factory as my birthday outing dinner choice, and I wasn't disappointed! We did have a short wait (30 minutes), but it was New Year's Eve, so it was to be expected. It's usually a good sign for a restaurant if there is a wait, though, right? Anywho, firstly - this is very ridiculous of me, but also a sign of how easy I am to impress: they serve bread - two kinds in fact! One brown-in-color with grains scattered about here and there, and your run of the mill Italian style loaf. Unfortunately I'm one of those customers that becomes quietly disgruntled if there isn't bread. Sad I know. It's the little things. I'll continue to the juice, the important part if you will. I did not like how close we sat to other tables...it's the style where there's one seating rail against a wall, and little two-seater tables lined up with about 21/2 feets space between the other man's table on either side, and a on the opposite end of table. I understand this is typical some places, but when you're out for dinner and not at a bar, you generally don't want to hear your neighbors' conversation or vice versa. The server was friendly and accommodating. We never felt rushed, which I strongly appreciate. When I go out to dinner, I despise the feeling of ""okay, you're done - now please leave because we need turnover."" The food: I had the grilled veggie burger accompanied by a salad with vinaigrette dressing as my main entree, ordered from 'The Skinnylicious' menu. While I know it might not sound appealing to a lot - YUM! Very flavorful and delicious. The salad consisted of a fluffy, deceivingly generous portion of rich-in-color mixed greens, with a tomato or two, dowsed in the vinaigrette dressing. I assumed it would taste as one would expect - nothing to write home about, it's lettuce, right? That dressing was amazing! I don't love vinaigrettes, though I'm trying to. But this one was on the mark. Unique and delicious. Oh, and for drink I had the strawberry lemonade, which was seriously addictive. I went through a solid 3 refills without a problem in an embarrassingly short amount of time.Onto the cheesecake: I ordered the tiramisu cheesecake, and my friend ordered the carrot cake cheesecake. The carrot cake cheesecake was okay, however the tiramisu was decadent! So yum! As an added yay!-point, My cheesecake came with a candle in whipped cream, lighted by the server at the table, and ""Happy Birthday!"" written in chocolate sauce around the plate. It's the little things! In conclusion - beautiful restaurant, great service, delicious food with tables slightly too close for comfort (in my case). I would recommend anyone going here.

"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I hear a lot of people talk about The Cheesecake Factory and on how great it is. I don't see what all the hype is all about really. Great how??? Decided to go on a Sunday afternoon around 5pm. First off, we had to wait about 30 min to be seated. I got a great view of seeing people enter and exit the restaurant every 5 seconds. Plus, it was raining and we couldn't wait in the lobby because there were 50 people waiting to be seated and about 20 people waiting to get cheesecake. After the wait, we had to go searching for the host and finally we heard him screaming over the crowd. We were seated next to two other couples. I felt like I was in a school cafeteria. I could reach over and slap the woman next to me or eat off her plate if I wanted to...but I would never do anything that crazy, but you get the idea. We were that close to each other. I really didn't like the fact we were able to hear other people's conversation in full detail. This place is extremely loud. You can't keep anything private unless you're in your own booth, which, that's where I wish we were. The table was small and before the server finally arrived at our table, I was ready to go.I got frustrated going through the menu and I wanted it to be over, so I decided to get the Smoke Burger, or whatever it's called. I've had a better burger at Burger King and I think the fries were just ok. I'm sure other things on the menu are good, but I'll never find out.The only reason I'm giving this two stars and not one is because the server was really nice and professional. The food was at our table fast and she did a good job checking on us to see if we needed anything. She was tipped very well and if I knew her name, I would name drop and give her kudos for her hard work.My opinion, go to Cheesecake Factory for the cheesecake only and get it to go!

We went during happy hour so we enjoyed the buffalo blasts which are always amazing and since it was happy hr we got a full order for only $5 WOW! For our main course we both had fish and chips which were average and typical for a large chain restaurant especially one that has such a massive menu. The service was good and our food was out extremely fast (I'm guessing because everything we ordered was premade and just needed to be fried up for us.) The only thing that took a while was the cheese cake! It seems every time I go here it takes a good 10-20 min to get our cheesecake after we order it! It was ok though since we were already stuffed. And the cheese cake was amazing as always! She had the red velvet which never disappoints and I had the tiramisu that I really enjoyed!

They do try their best to give everyone the best experience possible. But there is so many people that things can get a little crazy. Our bread was not warm at all. It must had been sitting around for quite some time. The server was all over the place. At times we did not see him for 10 min. He would forget to bring us things we asked for, and just kept making us wait more and more. I'm not venting about them in a negative way though! Don't get me wrong! Its amazing that they can run this establishment as smooth as they do with as many people coming through as they do! I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad. It came out with not to much wait time. It was fresh, and well made! Tasted wonderful! Made up for all the other set backs...Moral of the story!!! If you enjoy mass amounts of people in a small area! This restaurant location is for you! If you suffer from social anxiety or hate being around tons of people... This might not be the Cheesecake Factory location for you! Fun environment If I do say so myself!

"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"Having grown up in Nashville, Cheesecake Factory is synonymous with excess in my head. Excessively large portions, excessively large prices, excessively lavish decor, excessively large stomachs needed. The food is nothing mind-blowing: just your standard American fare generally done well for a lot of money. Every time I eat here, I bring enough food back for a second and maybe even third meal. You've probably seen the crowds milling about the mall exit and wondered why they were all waiting for lavish, expensive, chain-restaurant food. I, too have that question, but hey, it's damn good lavish, expensive, chain-restaurant food, and over time has become a bit of an experience unto itself. If you're here, you're probably either celebrating something or rather wealthy. Be prepared to wait, although I've never waited for more than half an hour. Anything that comes with their mashed potatoes is a safe bet, as they're everything mashed should be--large, creamy, delicious, will land heavily in your stomach and fill you up. The fried mac and cheese appetizer is delicious. Fish tacos are my favorite order, I've had good experiences with their chicken chipotle pasta, and any one of their sandwiches is a safe choice--good and economical, as they're on the cheaper end of the massive, massive menu, and they come with a lot of fries.

"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"We went here for the first time the other night and I already knew it was a popular place as I had had many people say how much they loved the food so I wanted to check it out...neither the food nor the service disappointed as both were very good. Even though there were lots of people waiting to be seated we were able to be seated almost right away due to the fact that there were only two of us and the others waiting were groups of 8 plus. Our server greeted us as we were seated, drinks and bread arrived promptly thereafter and the appetizer we ordered came in just a few minutes. As some others have said the portion sizes are huge, they really are! The appetizer was enough for dinner alone. The main dishes we ordered were great and again the portions were huge. We only finished half took the rest too go along with dessert which was delicious too. They have a wide selection on the menu so almost everyone is sure to find something they could like and of course as the name implies they have a great selection of delicious cheesecakes! Now my only complaint for the about the place is the seating and this kept me from rating it any higher. You are packed in with very little room so if you don't mind being two feet away it is all good.  It seemed very loud too but this again could be due to the close proximity of others too!",The Cheesecake Factory,6154632400,86 reviews,2010-03-20,"Chattanooga, TN",/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville,3.0,160,"Washington, DC",Nick N.

"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"Sometimes, instead of trying out the local grub scene, one goes to a chain restaurant to look for some consistency.  That's why tourists go to McDonald's in England, because English food sucks, and you can always rely on a Big Mac to taste like a Big Mac no matter what you think of a Big Mac.Ergo, the Cheesecake Factory.  A restaurant chain, where in theory, no matter where you are, every restaurant should look the same, and the food should taste the same.  The Cheesecake Factory in Green Hills was just nasty.  Nasty service, nasty food...damn, how can you mess up on Vietnamese Spring Rolls?  Our main courses sucked mega balls too.  Worst yet everything came out on time except for one plate - which came 15 minutes later - which meant that the rest of us waited for the final plate to come out - which meant our meals were cold by the time we started eating.The thing is, the people who work there walk around like ""We're Cheesecake.  We're the shit.  Our food is awesome.""

"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I've always loved Cheesecake Factory. I'm a sucker for their Caramel Chicken dish (it's huge, so I'd suggest eating half and taking half home) and am always tempted to get a slice of cheesecake after my meal (but I'm usually too full from the huge meal). Their brown bread that they serve before your meal comes is absolutely fantastically delicious (especially if it's nice and warm). My family and I went there last night and it was PACKED. They said it was a two-hour wait, so we watched the bar area like a hawk until a table opened up (didn't want to wait two hours, and bar seating allows you to grab a table once someone is finished--just be diligent about it). We got a fantastic server, who happily complied with our specific requests (only brown bread, please!) and at the end of our meal, he gave us a whole loaf of brown bread to take home. Now THAT'S customer service!! We left happy, satisfied, and quite full. Also, right now they have a deal going on: for every $25 you spend on gift cards, you get a coupon for a free slice of Cheesecake.

"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"A group of 10 of us decided to celebrate a friend's birthday at this restaurant. We chose valet parking. We arrived at 6:30 PM, fully aware that there would be a hefty wait, but we were willing because everyone loves the Cheesecake Factory experience. We were told there would be a 2.5 hr wait and shortly after we were told it was dropped down to 1.5 hr. About every 30 min we would check in to see what the wait was and we were constantly told ""About 20 min"". We were finally seated at 9 PM. It took approximately 15 min for water to be served and bread to be brought to our table. Everyone ordered a round of drinks and it took another 20 minutes for those to arrive. When my friend asked if there were gluten free options, our waitress, Dawn, told her that she couldn't guarantee anything and she would be taking a gamble with anything she ordered. My friend, who rarely comes out because of anxiety, was treated with an incredible amount of disrespect and left her irritated and stressed about dinner the rest of the night. At this point, I went and talked to the manager to let him know what the waitress said. As we ordered our dinner, we also ordered a second round of drinks. Menus were never taken away from our table and appetizer dishes were stacked high before they were cleared away. Dinner came, we all finished our food and plates were cleared away before our drinks even arrived. At that point, no one cared to have another drink, but since the drinks are priced so high we didn't have a choice. I left the table again to talk to a different manager, Travis. I told him about our experience and how we were extremely disappointed with our service. I let him know that we were all willing to wait the long amount of time because we all love this restaurant but the experience once we sat down was completely unacceptable. He apologized and was very gracious. He offered to buy everyone's dessert and also was going to take off the auto 18% tip. When we asked for dessert menus, 1 was brought to us for a table of 10. Another 20 minutes went by before we were able to order. Our dessert came out one by one, making the night even slower. Had our waitress been bringing us our bills at that point we would have been able to speed the process up. Instead we had to track her down. She was tipped poorly by everyone. By the time we left the restaurant it was 11:35 PM. The valet service closed at 9:30 PM. We were the only car left and the employee had to wait only for us. Our plans to go out after dinner for my friends birthday were ruined because we spent over 5 hours at dinner for what was the absolute worst dining experience myself and the others in the group have ever had ANYWHERE. We chose The Cheesecake Factory because we have all been avid fans of it for over 10 years. This experience was unacceptable and the chance of me dining at that location is very slim.",The Cheesecake Factory,6154632400,1 review,2012-11-18,"Antioch, TN",/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville,1.0,160,"Washington, DC",Kate C.
"2133 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"The only Cheesecake Factory in Tennessee from this nationally favorite restaurant chain. It is located at The Mall at Green Hills, Nashville's only higher end luxury mall. I have ate here over fifty times probably so definitely have experienced the variety it has to offer. The most stunning thing about this restaurant next to the variety and portion of food is the atmosphere. Even compared to some other Cheesecake Factorys it is gorgeous in size. An blue tower with glittering lights that look like stars adorns the high double doored entryway. High windows, and high ceilings that stretch two or three stories. Beautiful art, marble, huge mirrors, and windows. The vastness and beauty makes it feel as if you are dining in some kind of exotic palace.The menu is a small book! They offer the huge variety of dishes with very large portions, if you have ever ate at a Cheesecake Factory before you will recognize the dishes. If not then you will have to eat there to understand the variety! The food for me is great. For such a large restaurant the food tastes as if a lot of attention was paid to detail, and I almost have always had great food eating there. I have developed a liking to three or four particular dishes. I love the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, which is a great Caribbean dish for a chain restaurant. The Chicken Madeira is a huge favorite among mostly everyone who dines there, and has a very unique taste. If you like sushi or don't mind trying raw tuna, I highly recommend their Ahi Carpaccio which is a thin slice of raw Ahi tuna. It actually tastes very good even those who did not like sushi that I got to try it liked it quiet a bit. The service itself is so-so here. They are usually very busy so are not able to pay a lot of personal attention. We really liked a few of the waiters who seemed very friendly, but several have left or were not there when we were. The hostesses are generally very accommodating and friendly though, and even if you miss a page they will allow you to sit immediately sometimes.The only real negative about the place is the wait on the weekends and some busy weekday evenings. It can be 1 to 2 hours or even more on their busiest weekends so just be aware! You can walk around the mall with the waiting pager and I have found it goes off even in Macy's. The mall closes at 9 though.This is also a great place to eat on the weekends since they close fairly late, I believe 12:30 on Saturday nights!",The Cheesecake Factory,6154632400,41 reviews,2007-09-20,"Murfreesboro, TN",/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-nashville,4.0,160,"Washington, DC",Darrell B.

My wife had the tuna melt. She said it was real good. I would go back. I would not drive across town to eat there. To me it's only worth it if you're nearby.  Too many other good choices in the area.,Tower Market and Deli,6156501005,11 reviews,2015-10-12,"Franklin, TN",/biz/tower-market-and-deli-nashville,3.0,25,"Washington, DC",Joey S.
"1305 Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",4.0,"So we came back again of course. I live only minutes away and I've been dreamin' about that BLT for days. This time the owner Abraham was there, and as soon as I asked for oil or vinegar, he knew me from the review!He is a super awesome guy and very friendly, he obviously has a lot of pride and love put into the business. He took heed of my last review and added oil and vinegar to the sauces for people with mayo allergies. Not only that, he offered to give me a free sandwich next time we come in. This is, and will be, my new favorite sandwich shop in east nashville. The atmosphere, shop, staff and food are all superb.

"1305 Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",4.0,"I don't want to leave a poor review for a new, local business as it is obviously still in the process of finding it's niche but I have been by 3 times so far so I feel like my review is fair. I do agree with other reviewers. The ordering process can be confusing. There is no designated spot where customers just know to ""order here."" You awkwardly order at the deli counter so the line is kind of all over the place. Also there are no set breakfast hours. I ordered biscuits and gravy at 4:15pm on my first visit. I'm not complaining that it's possibly an option for all day breakfast but they do need something that has breakfast hours posted or ""breakfast menu served all day."" I only asked for b&g because they were still sitting out. The service has been fine. Everyone has been very friendly and we have gotten our food in a timely manner upon each visit. They serve bongo Java coffee and that's awesome! Super tasty options and their coffee prices are great. Fountain drinks and an ample amount of bottled drinks are also available. The building itself is still in the works but I understand that small businesses sometimes just have to say ""we can't wait any longer. Let's just open up and we will finish once we start bringing in money."" So for now, it is an unfinished market, deli, and coffee shop. I can get down with that. The food. Alright here's where they are kind of losing me...First visit: stopped by to check the place out and grab some food to try. I thought about a sandwich but then saw gravy (I asked and it is vegetarian) and biscuits so I asked for that because the heart wants what it wants. For $2.99, I got 2 biscuits covered in gravy. My husband and I split these when I got home and they were both really good! On their own, the biscuits were a tad dry (I doubt they made another batch of ""dinner 'scuits"") but the flavor was good and they were covered in creamy, delicious gravy so that made it all better. I wanted more. Second visit: we decided to grab some sandwiches for dinner a couple nights ago. Justin chose the Music City Tuna & I chose the Music City Gobbler. The menu board says that all sandwiches come with mayo, lettuce, tomato, and a pickle spear on the side. His came on marble bread (an odd choice for a tuna sandwich?), with a huge portion of tuna salad, lettuce, tomato, and pepperjack cheese. He didn't receive the included cheese. My sandwich came on sesame wheat bread, with a huge portion of sliced turkey, the thinnest slice of cheddar cheese, avocado, horseradish sauce, and I asked to add onions. It didn't come with the included lettuce and tomato which I did also want on the sandwich. The onions are pickled which rules. Neither of us received a pickle spear. These little things they will obviously fix over time because the employees are still learning the menu and probably are overwhelmed (this all goes back to the confusing ordering process - the same lady who took our order also helped make our food) but I wasn't wild about the taste of either sandwich anyway. The tuna was overly sweet for both of our tastes and he ended up cutting his sandwich into actual bites with a fork and eating it that way because it was too messy otherwise hahah I also thought there was too much turkey on my sandwich (but I'm also new to eating turkey again so this may just be a personal opinion). I could barely taste the horseradish sauce or cheese because all I could taste was turkey. Again, I'm sure they will work out the kinks over time but I probably wouldn't order either of these sandwiches again. Third visit: today we went for breakfast, but we got our food to go. We both ordered our beloved biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs, he chose home fries and I chose turkey sausage. The home fries tasted good but were kind of soggy rather than crispy potatoes. My eggs were in the same container as my sausage, which was in a puddle of liquid. The taste of these were fine, and after soaking up the juice in the bottom of the container, this was all I ended up eating. The biscuits and gravy. WHAT HAPPENED. When we opened our containers, we licked some gravy off the lid (because we are fatties) and I said ""does yours also taste like cigarette smoke?"" He said it did. So I tried a bite with a biscuit from the container because I thought it might just be the lid and that's what I get for licking it like a pig. Nope. The gravy tasted like someone had mixed in ashes from a cigarette. I tasted a bite of both separately to see if I was insane and it was definitely the gravy. I did call the market and tell them that if they hadn't tasted the gravy that they should because I had it once before and it was awesome but it tasted like cigarettes today. Long story long, I'll give this place another shot because it is new and still has potential but so far, I'm not in love.",Tower Market and Deli,6156501005,237 reviews,2015-09-05,"Nashville, TN",/biz/tower-market-and-deli-nashville,3.0,25,"Washington, DC",Ashley T.

"1305 Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",4.0,I ordered a turkey and bacon sandwich on the hero bread and it was the best sandwich I've had in 3 years! I also got a side of the homemade chips which were excellent...especially dipped in the sauce that came with it. The only downside was that it was so good I ate literally every single bite (once you see how huge these sandwiches are you'll understand).

"1305 Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",4.0,"I know this place is new, and maybe they just had an off day, but I was really disappointed by my order.I got two things, a chicken biscuit and a BLT. Biscuit itself was dry and crumbly, the sandwich itself looked like it had been smashed. The (mostly) breaded cutlet was a little overcooked and largely tasteless. It was ok overall.The BLT was on untoasted wheat (who the heck puts BLTs on wheat? Yuck.) that was too weak to hold up to the filling. I picked it up and the bread just kind of flopped over and everything fell out. I would like to say that the fillings were very generous and looked delicious. I say looked because I didn't eat the sandwich. Their 'house dressing' is mayo. I do.not. eat. mayo. I hate it. The very sight of it disgusts me. (I'm sure you see what I'm getting at here.) I asked for no dressing on my sandwich, and well, guess what it had? That just fucking pissed me off. It was a to go order and I didn't have time to go back so I just threw it away.So so overall.

"1305 Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",4.0,"Had the chicken salad today and wasn't really impressed. There was virtually no texture to it, very much a chicken paste.

Plus, it's great to have a quick breakfast option in the morning. They have a full coffee bar including lattes. They also have a number of organic grocery items. What a great option when you just need a couple of things and don't feel like fighting the crowds at one of the mediocre Krogers on the Eastside. Some of the prices on the groceries are high, like $7ish for eggs. I'm sure that's because they don't get the big bulk discount like the box stores do.

"121 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"Love any sandwich wrap they offer. If you go here, sign up for the Club Card..you can earn points to earn free food!! They also will give you some coupons time to time for free soda or something off the price of the food.. Great food!I love food there, and its a lot like subway you can choose the food that you put on the wraps. You can choose the veggies, the dressings, and then of course the protein element. My favorite here is the Chicken Club. I always get the whole wheat wrap which is very thin and special made for them at a local bakery ( I asked because I was trying to find some to make my own at home)it is like a big pouch.!!! They put in your topping choices mine is Spinach, Avocado, tomatoes, red onions, black olives, Jalapenos, black beans, seasoning (salt pepper and oregano) with feta cheese and my sauce is Jalapeno Ranch ...They then add the freshly grilled meat choice and wrap it tight. AS they start to wrap they also scrunch to give it a tight roll that holds firm.You can eat there, even though small location (historical old building on 2nd) it is roomy and open inside. Or they will wrap it to walk and eat, or just to go back to the office (which is how I order it)..I love this restaurant its only a few blocks from my office and I go here every now and then. I am on a diet (always) so the food is FRESH and Great Pricing!! and DELICIOUS!!!!If you get a chance to eat downtown, try out this great restaurant!!!

"121 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"Pita Pit is one of the few ""quick sandwich for lunch"" options that we have near my office, and it's generally pretty tasty.  It feels like a mix of Subway, Chipotle, and the delis I remember so fondly in New York.  The food seems fresher than most places and the staff is always great, cheerful, and helpful.  Seating is very limited so I often just order it to go.  They also have online ordering which makes life easier if you're in a hurry, as is often the case.  The prices are reasonable and there's enough food in a pita wrap to fill you up but not weigh you down (unless you load it down with cheese, sauce, and cream, of course).  Be sure to sign up for a loyalty card while you're there.Easter Egg:  You can get into this place from the alleyway, as well.  Can you guess which door it is?",Pita Pit,6152557482,70 reviews,2013-11-15,"Nashville, TN",/biz/pita-pit-nashville,4.0,41,"Washington, DC",Ryan P.

"121 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"I wish there was a ZERO star option. I will never eat here again. My office placed an order for three meals for lunch delivery. Given, this restaurant is about a three minute walk from our office but we were busy and it is cold out.... so we ordered. When 45 minutes went by without food, we started calling. Between us, we probably called 5-10 times and no answer. I started to get worried, and looked and saw they had debited my card. I walked down there. Given, they were pretty busy. I stood in line, kindly told the gentleman at the counter that I had delivered over an hour ago and still didn't have my food. He started screaming, WE BUSY!!! I reminded him that they are a business, and need to answer their phone... WE SO BUSY WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO ANSWER OUR PHONE! They had not even started making our food, so i asked for a refund. He then started telling me DONT GET IRATE WITH ME! YOU'RE ON CAMERA!!! and then started taking orders of the folks lined up behind me. Finally, after ten min or so of him waiting on other customers he came back to me and handed me his manager's phone number and told me to have a nice day. I said, ""I'm not leaving here without a refund."" He said I had to call her to get her to tell him how to get a refund. (Right - because that's the customer's duty...) and so I called. Her phone went straight to voicemail. I stood and he ignored me for awhile longer. I finally said loudly, ""HER PHONE WENT TO VOICEMAIL, SIR!"" and he continued to ignore me. I stepped back, waited til all the customers cleared out, then approached again. He told me that he couldn't do anything, i would have to wait and talk to her. I told him I wanted my food if I couldn't get a refund (preferably I wanted both). He argued with me further, and I loudly told him I was not leaving here without SOMETHING. They then made my meals, one at a time. They could've put everything on the grill at once, but that would have been too nice of them.

There's something about ice cream that really hits the spot after Mexican food.

A few squirts of flavoring were added into a cup followed by chocolate ice cream from a fast food looking soft serve ice cream dispenser. It was all blended together and I was out the door 5 minutes later for $2.39. Was it a chocolate milk shake? Yes. Would I order one again from Dairy King? No. It sounds like this place has been around for years and I have a strong appreciation for longevity in the food industry. It's hard for any business to stick around that long let alone a restaurant. But the whole place just screamed high school cafeteria to me so I won't be heading back.

"2330 Franklin PikeNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"A coworker had nothing but good things to say about this place and her food did look good so I decided to try it for lunch the following day. I couldn't find a menu online so I went in to order. The menu changes daily so I guess that's why. The place was packed with old people so I assumed good things about the food. I ordered the mashed potatoes, fried okra and coleslaw. I thought the coleslaw was the best of the 3 but not that great. The fried okra was greasy and I didn't finish them all. The mashed potatoes were the saltiest potatoes I've ever had from a restaurant and I could not eat them. Staff was only friendly to the regular customers.

In a time when many of the old meat & 3 restaurants are pretty long in the tooth, Sylvan Park is still kicking. It still looks the same, but bright and clean and inviting. I sat in a little 2 top on the edge of a bunch of obvious regulars. It's always a good sign when the parking lot of a breakfast place is full of pickup trucks. I had a very good omelette and coffee.

"1716 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I figured now that I live on this side of the river, I'd support a neighborhood eatery so I popped into Fattoush for my constant hummus fix. The parking lot is small and shared with a Subway and adjacent to a busy intersection so it's a bit of a nightmare. However, at 5pm on a Friday this place was not busy at all. I was the only customer. The guy working behind the counter was a bit abrasive but was efficient in making my falafel sandwich. I skipped the fries and opted for a side of hummus and some pita bread instead. Throw in a 20 ounce bottle of Diet Coke and you have a little combo meal for $7.50 including tax. Not too shabby!The sandwich was flavorful and filling! The hummus was okay but nothing extraordinary or perhaps I am just a bit bent out of shape because he literally gave me 4 little triangles of pita for a large styrofoam container of hummus?I will likely come by here again because it's so close to my new pad but it would only be out of convenience to pacify a raging hummus craving...",Fattoush Cafe,6153211667,798 reviews,2012-03-02,"Nashville, TN",/biz/fattoush-cafe-nashville,3.0,39,"Washington, DC",Marcia M.
"1716 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"The food here is pretty standard Middle Eastern/Mediterranean, nothing mind blowing, but nothing horrible.  It gets fairly packed during lunch with the hospital and downtown crowd.  $5 gets you a loaded beef/lamb gyro packed in a pita, with an added touch of tabouli that you don't see in most gyros.  Overall, the food isn't terribly impressive, but I would be willing to try again and get some different items to see if they are better.",Fattoush Cafe,6153211667,201 reviews,2010-08-26,"Nashville, TN",/biz/fattoush-cafe-nashville,3.0,39,"Washington, DC",Peter K.

The place was empty, so I got all of my food made fresh. Yes, it took a while, but good food sometimes does.I stayed to the middle eastern basics: Hummus: was creamy, garlicky and tangy. It tasted fresh and alive compared to some bland pastes that I have had from stores and lesser joints.Baba Ghannoush: bright flavors of the roasted eggplant, a bit tart, really good.Grape leaves: made on site the owner said (most just take them out of a can), not too chewy, good vegetarian dolmas.Falafel - made fresh with good spices and flavors, hot out of the oil as they should be. Take the extra time and get him to make them fresh.Kibbe: not as exciting - ground lamb fried in a wheat crust kind of like falafel.So: stick to the vegetarian basics and you will be happy.I didn't try any of the shawarma/gyro style plates, and they were missing some good middle eastern staples, like foul and lebneh.

"1716 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Excellent food quality. The hummus, baba ghannouj, gyro meat, chicken shawarma are all fantastic. Also, the tahini sauce is spicy and delicious. The only problems are that (especially at lunchtime on a weekday) it will take a while to get your food. It's Chipotle-style assembly line setup, and they only have two people working the line. There's no real rhyme or reason to how they operate, and this can lead to standing in line for a good 8-10 minutes to get your food. Another drawback is that everything is served on styrofoam plates- I shouldn't have to explain how awful styrofoam is for the environment. Honestly they just need more staff and a better, more organized assembly line system for the lunch rush. And they need to start using real plates.On the positive side- if the line gets too long, the owner is very nice and usually gives you your drink for free, and he's also good about remembering returning customers.

"114-B 29th Ave NNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Another great venture brought to me by Scoutmob app.I decided to look up the menu before ordering, and I have to say on a side not that it meant a lot to me that they took my discount over the phone, and on a takeout order, because most discounts will not be applied if not dining in (huge plus for me who only had an hour break). I purchased a small pepperoni stromboli and the appetizer of potato wedges (random i know). Staff was SUPER friendly; over the phone, in person. I never had a stromboli before, so granted I do not have anything to compare this to, but for what is originally $7.99, that thing is a honker! I couldn't even eat half of it in one sitting. The bread of the stromboli tastes like it's a garlic bread. The whole thing is so freaking yummy. Potato wedges were yummy too, don't get me wrong.There is no doubt that I am returning.

Pretty frequently, my brother and I get delivery for dinner instead of a sad little sandwich with one piece of turkey on it (not enough for a grown man). Bellagios has quick delivery and friendly service, but what sold it for me was the custom, create your own stromboli. Good GOD is it hard to get just what you want from a pizza joint. They typically don't allow topping or filling substitutions on their specialty items and building your own pizza can get pricey quick when toppings are $2 a pop. Not at Bellagios.I love veggie pizzas and ordered a veggie filled stromboli for dinner. The custom strombolis and calzones allow you to have 5 pizza toppings of your choice in the doughy goodness they make. The sizes are small, medium, large or extra large but let it be known, the SMALL is plenty for TWO people. At $7.99, that's a great deal.

But I think their bread and butter is delivery, rather than for people dining in. Food is cooked to order, so waiting 10-15 minutes for my meal was doable. The stromboli is like a calzone. I still don't remember the technical difference between the two. But I do remember that their stromboli had a nice, crunchy crust. Very fresh ingredients.I wish there were red pepper flakes or other canisters of the usual seasonings on the tables, but there were none. The stromboli lacked oomph, for lack of a better word. I noticed on the counter that they offered pepper flakes, seasonings, ranch dressing, etc. for 50 cents; whether that was for extra or in general, I do not know.I had their plain cheesecake, which came in a sealed plastic container. It's not made on the premises. On the other hand, I appreciated that the ingredients did not list any ingredients I didn't want (soy, HFC, etc.).

"2613 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Let me start off by saying I love performing regularly at and supporting this venue.  I often recommend it because they have been helpful in supplying a place for the music community to call a home, so this stinks that I have to post a negative opinion.  Unfortunately, I just can't stand by and be silent at this point.I'm very disappointed that the $40/car parking fee (for the U2 concert) kept so many friends Saturday night from attending a recording of a live performance.  Many people who were coming to support the songwriters and or perform, themselves, were turned away at the parking lot entrance.  The guys charging for parking spaces claimed they didn't know...to me that's irrelevant...THE HOLIDAY INN SELECT knew (they were charging over $300/night for a room that night) and did not seem to care.  Who ever is in charge of the Commodore and the Holiday Inn seems to be out of touch.  I was also told that the guys collecting the parking fees did it on their own and got to keep the money...it didn't even go to the people at the hotel (or the other songwriters who played).  Sounds like a ripoff to me.  On top of all of that, the Commodore Grille did not appear to be prepared to handle the business before and after the U2 concert at Vandy.  This was all a repeat of the problem they had handling the business for the trombone player convention that had two shows there the week before.  I'll be they didn't realize at least 5 to 7 thousand extra dollars in business between those three nights in total and it won't even show up in their computer printouts--they don't even realize it.  I'm personally friendly with all the servers and bartenders there...they got screwed with the early closing and lack of preparation...clearly a management problem.Kudos and thanks to songwriter night hosts Rick & Tammy Stewart, Debi Champion, the staff of servers, bartenders and songwriters who persevered and endured these crazy nights, despite lack of support from the management at the Commodore Grille or the Holiday Inn Select.",Commodore Grille,6153274707,6 reviews,2011-07-03,"Nashville, TN",/biz/commodore-grille-nashville-2,1.0,13,"Washington, DC",Sam C.
"2613 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",3.5,This place is definitely much cooler than you'd expect for a hotel bar in a Holiday Inn Select.Why I like this place:1. This is a GREAT place for up and coming songwriters. If you are new in town they are very welcoming and if you just came to listen to music you might be hearing the next big thing. Its an eclectic bunch that hangs out here so it makes even more fun. They have writer's nights here 7 nights a week from 7-11PM. On rare occasions something else is going on and takes over but you've pretty much have good acoustic live music almost every night.2. They have pretty good bar food. Sandwiches and salads have been good and they make some delicious sweet potato fries.3. Its smoke free inside. They have a nice patio area for smokers to enjoy though.My only reason for not giving it 5 stars:Drinks. I've ordered margaritas a few times and had a mystery drink delivered to my table that tasted like watered down orange juice...and with no salt. It all really depends on the bartender that is there that night. If you're in the area and like listening to singer/songwriters singing their original tunes then you should definitely check this place out.,Commodore Grille,6153274707,87 reviews,2010-11-26,"Nashville, TN",/biz/commodore-grille-nashville-2,4.0,13,"Washington, DC",Sasha T.

"3808 Cleghorn AveNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I've been looking for a good Hibachi restaurant in Nashville for some time now, and this is probably the best in the area, though it still has some major flaws. The food is actually really great - traditional hibachi style rice and huge plates of food. The salmon and chicken hibachi dishes looked amazing and were generously portioned. The appetizers were nice and we all had a good time passing each dish around. I had the tempura udon, which was pretty average, but again, more food than I'd expected for the price. The atmosphere is a bit run down, and I honestly would not choose this place for any special occasion because of it. In addition, the wait staff was an absolute mess. That being said, we didn't sit at the grill, as if that's an excuse for our food coming at completely different times (like 30 minutes apart!). The whole place was empty and there were easily enough servers to keep us satisfied, but we just ran into problem after problem with them and ended up being stuck there for over two hours. We did have around ten people in our party, but there is just absolutely no excuse for that much of a gaffe in service.

Anyways, great value and as good as any Japanese cuisine I've had in Nashville.  I believe this is going to be my go to place for Japanese in the future.",Tokyo Japanese Steak House,6152976608,3 reviews,2014-07-28,"Victoria, Canada",/biz/tokyo-japanese-steak-house-nashville,4.0,66,"Washington, DC",Tim M.
"3808 Cleghorn AveNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"So it was a dark and cool night when my wife and I decided to take a much needed break from our busy everyday lives to enjoy a date nite. I've always wanted to try an restaurant in Nashville where they cook the food right in front of you so we headed to Tokyo Steak House in Green Hills....now take in mind that they close at 11pm and we pulled up at 9:51pm,and from the outside décor its not ugly but lets just say it doesn't give the ""I can't wait to see what it looks like inside!"" Feel to it either.  So do to the time I was expecting a rushed dinner and unpleasant staff! Not the case at all!! They treated us like we had all the time in the world and was VIP.  I ordered two Long Islands and for dinner the Salmon & Shrimp meal and boy was it good! Wifey ordered the Shrimp & Chicken and she stated it was off the chain as well (that means really good in Ebonics) As our chef dazzled us with tricks and flames everywhere he also conversed with us making my wife and I feel at ease even though I'm sure we delayed him getting off, now that's GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!! We are planning our next date night out at this place except this time a lot earlier to kinda get a feel for the ambiance which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. I did enjoy the dimmed lighting and piano playing in the background, that along with alcohol kinda set the mood for a great continuation of the night if you feel me son!!..lolDEFINALTLY RETURNING!!",Tokyo Japanese Steak House,6152976608,234 reviews,2013-09-18,"Nashville, TN",/biz/tokyo-japanese-steak-house-nashville,4.0,66,"Washington, DC",Da Deacon H.

"3808 Cleghorn AveNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I see Tokyo Japanese Steak House all the time as I live very nearby and I'm intrigued by their patio...and their sign for Ladies Night on Thursdays.So my brother suggested sushi and we didn't want to go far from GH area and it was Thursday night after all.  Sooooo I suggested we try Tokyo after seeing that they do serve sushi as well as hibachi.So we went in and requested to be seated in the bar area.  The place was dead anyway, so we had our pick of places to sit.  It is a fairly large building with hibachi seating to your right, the bar straight in front of you, and the chefs in the back of the room on the way to the restrooms.  Looks like a good place for a large group to come enjoy some hibachi!  Also the bar area had this cool lighting thing going on that sent little pinpoints of light around the entire room.  I want that for a party!!Here's how the food stacked up:Edamame - basic, how can you really screw this up?Gyoza - fried dumplings, yum, came with a good sauceTuna sashimi - tasted good and freshSalmon sashimi - again, good and fresh.  Something was lacking with the sashimi though but I don't know what.  Not bad, just not great.Tornado roll - apparently that was crab meat on top but it was very fried and crispy tasting.  Nice but the topping was overpowering honestly.Smyrna roll - shrimp, cucumbers, spicy crab...it was really good after I swiped the mayo off the top.  Yuck - why mayo on sushi??  Yuck I say!!Drinks - 2 for 1 during happy hour, then 2 for 1 for the ladies after.  And since I sat at the bar, I didn't have to worry if I would be served those prices.  I'd recommend sticking to the martini menu instead of ordering a dirty martini.In the meantime a band was cranking up.  This band had a stand up bass, bongos, etc.  They weren't bad, think Santana sounding, so it added to the quirky nature of the entire experience.  Our waitress was adorable and although I couldn't understand her sometimes she was cute and also even cracking some jokes.Overall not a bad experience and I really want to go try the hibachi offerings.  Plus that patio is really nice...somehow I don't think about Japanese restaurants as a place to go sip numerous cocktails on the patio but perhaps I should.",Tokyo Japanese Steak House,6152976608,1027 reviews,2012-02-20,"Nashville, TN",/biz/tokyo-japanese-steak-house-nashville,3.0,66,"Washington, DC",Nickie G.

We were seated promptly but it took about 20 minutes for us to get a chef. I think most of the unpleasant experience came from the ""kids"" we were seated with. I think the staff seated us with them because they were in our age group but our maturity levels were vastly different. My husband and I kept looking longingly at the table with the quiet, well-behaved adults on the other side of the room. The group we were with was rowdy and their conversations were idiotic at best. Our chef was pleasant. The show was decent (albeit shorter than what we are used to) and the fire tricks were fun. I had the steak while my husband had the chicken and steak. We were both happy with our meals and the accompanying sauces. The fried rice is delicious! Do not, however, get the long island tea; it was disgusting. The sushi is the best that I have had in Tennessee. I highly recommend the dragon roll. They are nicely presented and fairly priced. All in all, the food is great for the price.

"3808 Cleghorn AveNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I can only speak on the Hibachi experience because that's all I've had so far here. But from what I've seen, this place exceeded my expectations. In my opinion, the decor inside is very sheek and the entire restaurant-- very spacious. While I waited for my friend to arrive, there was a nice comfy leather couch I sat on in the lobby. The host seemed a bit overly attentive, but I guess that's better than the alternative!When I saw the prices for lunch, I was pleasantly surprised. Hibachi for lunch is, for the most part, under $10 unless you are ordering filet mignon. That's a steal in my book! The lunch special came with a miso soup, a house salad with a delicious ginger dressing, and the hibachi meat (or a veggie option) of your choice and fried rice! It was so much food and really good!We even got a surprise dessert at the end. I had mentioned to the host early on that I was there to celebrate my friend's birthday. At the end of the meal, our server brought out a ""Tokyo"" hat (to wear for a picture that apparently goes on the wall) and a mochi ice cream dessert for my friend. I didn't even know they did that!

GASP! 15 minutes later we were at Tokyo Japanese Steak House and was ready and primed for my first hibachi experience. My first stop was the bar of course. After a long day at work it is necessary to have a stiff drink. The bartender quickly gave me 2 bottles of Sake2Me (love the name), it's a 2 for $3 special during happy hour (before 7pm). I had the Mango and Green Tea versions. I don't like sake but this tasted like Snapple tea that got me drunk off my ass. Feeling a little loose and super excited to see entertainment and eat all in one seating I began to look over the menu. It looked pretty standard. Chicken and shrimp, steak, lobster, salmon etc. Priced from $20 to 26 depending on what you got. Then the show began! It was alright, the guy did do some cool tricks and was pretty entertaining, not a big talker. We did the standard catch food in your mouth, onion volcano, egg cracking tricks, etc. The food was good, I had the chicken and salmon. Salmon was delicious, not fishy at all and the soy sauce glaze really hit home. My roommate had chicken and steak. She ordered it medium and though not the best quality steak it was medium. The fried rice was heavenly, honestly I could eat it every day. By the end of the meal I was stuff and drunk. I had a total of 4 Sake2Me's and at 7% a piece I am not the strapping young drinker I used to be in college. Roomie drove us home and I ate the leftovers the next day. Great experience.

"3808 Cleghorn AveNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I learned about Tokyo in Green Hills when they offered a $30 Groupon a few months ago. I love hibachi and sushi, so I jumped on it. It ended up being the perfect spot for a Thursday night date. The crowd was fairly light, and we were seated right away in a fairly private booth.Thursday is Ladies Night, so most drinks - including the signature cocktails - were 2 for 1. The only caveat was the drinks had to be ordered directly from the bar, and not through our server. Though this annoyed us a little at first, it ended up being a good thing, as there was an excellent 4-piece jazz combo set up in the bar area. I recommend the Dragon Manhattan. It had a classic bourbon edge, but with a mandarin orange kiss instead of the usual dry vermouth. The bartender mixed it perfectly.We chose several different sushi varieties, with my favorites being the Tempura Shrimp Roll and the Dragon Roll. Our meals came with a small Asian salad and simple miso soup that was light but tasty. Our server was friendly and knew the sushi menu well. Definitely ask the staff for recommendations if you can't make up your mind.At least one reviewer has complained about the decor. I completely disagree. I loved the subtle, wood-accented decor and the dim lighting. I seemed to help me focus on the conversation with my date. I might have even described it as romantic. The smaller crowd also meant less background noise, which was great for someone with no-so-amazing hearing like me.The pricing was great for a young professional-on-a-budget.

"140 5th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Very loud! That was the biggest problem with this restaurant, other diners were being so loud and obnoxious it really ruined the entire experience. My wife said she felt like she was in a bar. People were actually going ""woooo!"" and not just once, but repeatedly. I could barely hear my wife and she was across the table from me. It was loud enough to be actually painful.The service was pretty good, although the server did neglect to ask me if I wanted any sauce on my steak. The food was decent. I had the mixed green salad and the filet mignon, and my wife had the lobster bisque and the steak. The salad was what I expected. In fact I'm glad I ordered the smaller portion of salad, given how generous the salad I received was. The steak was tasty and flavorful without additional sauce. The problem is that both my wife and I asked for our steaks medium rare. Mine was medium rare. Hers was very rare, to the point of being blue in the center. Hers also had not been properly cleaned as it contained some extra gristle or tendon. I know steakhouses can be busy, but given that we ordered the same thing at the same time, getting one of them wrong is not acceptable. Frankly, the steak was exactly what I'd expect from Outback Steakhouse, and Outback charges a heck of a lot less and includes a salad and side.Our bill was $179 before the tip, and we just had one appetizer, the steak, and a dessert each with no side dishes.I would only go here if you want to say you've dined at The Palm.

"140 5th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I couldn't remember if I had been to this place or not. (Not memorable, perhaps?) But it was a surprise dinner on my birthday, and destined to be a good time.I was saddened when our party was seated in such a tight space in the middle of a VERY LOUD dining room. Being literally half deaf, this was challenging for me. I quickly realized the other members of my party were equally saddened since they had apparently noted it was a birthday celebration when making the reservation. Oh well...let's drink!Despite the many wine options, I went to one of my staples - Stemmari (which is a Sicilian pinot noir that tastes good with everything in my opinion).Our server (or servers? Who knows...there were lots of people that surrounded our table at the most random times) quickly served up a basket of bready goodness.A ""Lobster dinner for Two"" special was offered, and if this place is as good as it boasts it is, then their lobster should satisfy this coastal gal, right? Right.To start, my lobster partner and I chose a caesar salad and a watermelon and mozzarella salad. The latter was definitely not my favorite, but the caesar didn't suck since it wasn't drenched in dressing.I chose green beans with pine nuts, pepper, and pancetta, and the goat cheese whipped potatoes as my side choices. Both were pretty good. I would only wish for the potatoes to have a bit more flavor.The lobster was presented in a beautiful fashion, and the woman serving it (note she not our main server, but one of the random people to appear) seemed to be actually enjoying her job at that moment in time. It tasted good. Not bad, not great, just good.During my meal, one of the servers kept trying to remove the basket containing the remaining breads I had not yet consumed. My little, partially-Italian self became very frustrated at these attempts, and finally blurted out with a smile, ""Perhaps I would like to take this home with me? I mean, c'mon, it's great bread!"". The server seemed disgusted at such notion in his fine dining establishment. *rolls eyes* Whatever dude. We're paying for this, box it up already.I'm not sure what The Palm wants to be. Marketed as a fine dining establishment, I feel they really lack the ambiance (poor decor and poor acoustics), and quality of goods for the price to reach this level. Maybe five or more years ago they were there, but in Nashville's recent culinary explosion, they are far from hitting the mark. Additionally, we felt pushed to join their exclusive dining club for mucho dinero per year. But after that dining experience, it's not a club I wish to be a part of.",Palm Restaurant,6157427256,164 reviews,2013-12-28,"Nashville, TN",/biz/palm-restaurant-nashville-2,2.0,140,"Washington, DC",Martí M.

"140 5th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"We had not heard of The Palm since we are from out of town. The streets of Nashville were packed as the weekend had many events going on. Hotels were booked up and charging $700 for rooms downtown. INSANE! (We stayed out by the airport for $120). Walked around trying to find something within walking distance to Bridgestone, but did not want just bar food. Ended up in the line waiting for The Palm to open. Found out it was seating by reservations, but we managed to get one of the 3 high top tables in the bar without reservation. The place was too quiet..no music.As the hour went by and the place filled up with people, it became tooooo noisy and crowded. Some people stood hovering by our table making us feel rushed as we ate, because they wanted our table. The price of the food is RIDICULOUS! I have swallowing problems and the only thing I was able to order was a side of mashed potatoes and a side of brussel sprouts. They were $8.50 a piece! The potatoes were very bland. The brussel sprouts, while having good flavor, got thrown away after leaving there. I could not eat them because they were not cooked soft enough (even though I requested that they make them extra soft).My husband ordered the veal parmigiana which came out as a huge piece of pounded meat with runny sauce. The flavor was good, but no way was it worth $35 ! Everything is served ala carte, and that $35 plate of veal did not even come with a bed of pasta or a simple salad. My husband ordered a side of linguine for an additional $10. I had a soda. My husband had a few beers. The total bill was $112 !!!! And I left hungry... :-(  I will say the only thing going for this place is that the staff was extremely friendly. The servers have to be making a killing on tips, which is why they work there, I am sure.We will not be going back here. Way overpriced for a place where all customers were wearing jeans, not enough selection on the menu. No sides included in the meal, and overall, a very boring, dark, atmosphere.",Palm Restaurant,6157427256,2 reviews,2015-04-01,"Ringgold, GA",/biz/palm-restaurant-nashville-2,2.0,140,"Washington, DC",B M.
"140 5th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Service, Service, Service. The Service here alone gets it 4 stars. Came here before a concert at the Bridgestone and the place was packed. Great place for a special dining experience of the high end night out.Despite there not being an open seat anywhere after we sat down (thank god for reservations) the server was exceedingly calm, attentive, helpful and polite. The guy must have been related to the energizer bunny because not a single table he was responsible for was left in need of anything.To top it off at the end of the meal the restaurant held on to our leftovers in their fridge for pick up after the show! That was awesome.The reason they failed to achieve that fifth start is due to the all important quality to price ratio of the food they serve. The food is really expensive and the quality is good but without the service it definitely does not live up to the price tag.  I ordered the steak burger just because that was what I really was craving at the time. For the prices they are charging there should be no question that when you order a medium burger that it will come out very well done and dry. The creamed spinach I got as a side was phenomenal but the onion rings and fried chips were ok. Tended to be very greasy.In short: Service AMAZING, food ok, price expensive. The decor also leaves something to be desired.

It is, of course, obscenely expensive.

They were right about the price tag part. For killer food and experience I'm OK dropping some money. But when the food is just middle of the line and I'm paying $30 per plate, I get cranky. My mom and I ate here before the symphony one night, and what put me off at first was the decor. For a white tablecloth place, I didn't get the weird caricature wallpaper. How is that classy? The staff was fine and got us out the door in time for the concert, so I have to give them credit for that, but it also took them forever to get our drink and food order. I guess everyone was in a rush for the symphony that night, but it's not the experience you want when you are paying top dollar. Onto the food: we both had fish, and mine was average. Very buttery and salty and while I love the unhealthy twins on the right thing, I expect more flavor from a high end restaurant. My mom's fish was excellent, but still had lots of butter and salt, and once the bill came we both gasped. 1 round of drinks plus 2 entrees and 2 sides was almost $200. Ouch.

"140 5th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Today I was there for the functional equivalent of a business lunch.  It is a reasonably attractive place. Service was above average. I had what they describe as a power lunch which is I recall was about $25.  This is the multicourse meal which includes a simple salad, an entrée, and dessert.I had lobster bisque and that was creamy and somewhat acidic. For the entrée I had two very good fish. And for dessert it was chocolate cake.  Overall, it was a good meal that I enjoyed. What made it good or better was the individual who shared this lunch.  This restaurant is on the pricey side. It is certainly not a place that I would inhabit as a regular consumer. Since this was a special occasion, it was okay.It is the place that strives for 4 to 5 stars from what I felt. But my sense of my entire experience simply does not gear me to rating this place at that level.   As viewed from the totality of my culinary experience I would simply not reach that level.  I would go back there and try some other items but I don't think I'm going to have a chance because I am from out of town. That is unfortunate.This restaurant is part of a chain. And I have eaten at their Boston place. I recall that my Boston experience was someone better than my Nashville experience.As I was reading some comments I noticed that certain individuals compared this place to Wharton school. In my view having been to both, this place does not even closely match Morton's.

New Yorkers are nothing if not loyal to our history.  I digress.)I like sitting at the bar and ordering a few appetizers and drinks with friends, it's the best way to enjoy the ambience and not bankrupt ourselves.  Random conversations are always better at the bar.  As mentioned in several other reviews, the service is outstanding and the food is pretty good as well.  They also have a great selection of liquors- to include whiskey (so, Tennessee is a great place to be if I can't be home).I am not a fan of celebrity stalking, but I've been here late after a show at the Ryman and seen some classic country music personalities, not exactly folks you'd see on TMZ, but nice to know that it's got the stamp of approval from Nashville royalty.Great spot, do check it out!",Palm Restaurant,6157427256,107 reviews,2013-05-06,"Nashville, TN",/biz/palm-restaurant-nashville-2,4.0,140,"Washington, DC",Jill R.

Our server Rex didn't give descriptions regarding any specials, however the server at the next table gave impeccable descriptions of their specials, so much better that we would have ordered differently. The shrimp on my salad was fishy. The asparagus was limp and unseasoned. The $50 filet was undercooked and chewy. My husband even ordered a glass of wine which he was given the choice of 9oz or 6oz.

"140 5th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I will be honest - this place seems pricey, but I went last night for a Charity Event, and did not have to pay, so this review is STRICTLY about the food, service and ambiance. We began the evening in the bar where we enjoyed complimentary beverages.  I had a glass of Chardonnay (not by choice, that's the white they were pouring that evening), as well as a glass of Chandon Champagne.  My husband enjoyed a Woodford Reserve and Diet Coke.  They had quite a large selection of drinks.  The bar area was packed, so I didn't have much of a chance to see the decor, etc...but was pretty nice, overall.  There are even a few booths for extra seating.  We were then taken into the main dining room for dinner.  We had fresh rolls waiting for us at the table, and the service was incredible.  They didn't miss a beat; our glasses were always full.  The menu was pre-fixed - we started with a delish Caesar Salad.  It's the creamy dressing, and there was a lot on it.  Following the salad, the sides were delivered:  Creamed Spinach (which was fabulous) and the Cheesy Potatoes (which I am a HUGE fan of).  Our entrées came out promptly after the sides:  A large Filet Mignon (which was perfect) and an enormous Lobster (again, amazing) with a butter sauce and a lemon that enhanced the flavor!   I only had 2 bites of each, and was stuffed.  As the evening continued, they brought out a delectable Cheesecake.  I could only enjoy a taste of this because I was so full.  It was very tasty and creamy, with a THICK crust.  The staff was very accommodating.  I can't guarantee it is always like this, as this was a Celebrity Charity Event, but it really was very good.  The ambiance is a little weird in my opinion.  I've been to The Palms in Los Angeles, so I knew what to expect, but my husband had never been to one and he was a little confused.  For being such a classy restaurant, it is bizarre to have famous people's faces painted ALL over the walls.  :)  It's located directly across the street from the Bridgestone Arena on 5th - so the location is kind of cool, too.  Compared to all of the other fancy-schmancy steakhouses, this is pretty up there.  I like Flemings just as much, though - just a totally different feel.  Bon appetit!",Palm Restaurant,6157427256,80 reviews,2011-04-13,"Nashville, TN",/biz/palm-restaurant-nashville-2,4.0,140,"Washington, DC",Kaitlyn K.

"140 5th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Ok, let me start with the food was actually good, however, for $210 for two people, this place sucks monkey balls. The waiter, Chris,  was extremely rude implying that my fiancée was fat enough to be with child. After we where done and have left payment, I went to the bathroom, when I got back, he said ""oh there you are"" with a very rude attitude. Also, the drink service was horrible, if I had gone to any other restaurant my drink would have never been left empty, but this high class place left our drinks empty half the time we where there. Which brings me to the price. 28 dollars for a coke and a sprite with three refills each, and the worst part is the drinks where only half the size, about six ounces, of a place that charges an already absurd 4 dollars for a drink with unlimited refills. I understand charging 50 dollars for a steak, but 28 dollars for a few soft drinks? You have got to be kidding. Also, let me tell you about the bathrooms. Given that I just paid $210 dollars for a meal, you would think that the toilet stall would have enough room to move around with out having my clothing rub up against the toilet and the door at the same time, or that they wouldn't cheap out on the toilet paper, that the toilet paper dispenser would give out more than two square of paper at a time, but alas no. The valet parking was a very nice feature, but not enough to save me from giving this place a scathing review. Now lets, talk food. The lobster bisque was very good, but they skimped on the lobster, there was actually only a few lobster shavings, but the bisque part was still very good. For 15 dollars you would think they could include more than few shavings of lobster in the LOBSTER bisque. Most of the steak was very good, but again for 50 dollars you would think that the bottom of the steak wouldn't be slightly burned to a char. The rolls where severed cold... The mashed potatoes where served family style and where very good, but we didn't order the family style serving size. The deserts where very good, but for half the price you could get the same deserts at another restaurant served warm and with a side of ice cream. Don't get me wrong, I understood going in that the place was going to be over priced, and  I didn't care about the price, my point is that for the price, the service should have been better and they shouldn't have skimped in certain areas. I have been to five star restaurants before that charge these prices, this is not one of those places.  I got the distinct feeling that they where intentionally giving us bad service so that we would  never come back.Save your self $150 dollars and just go to outback and get better service.  Also the steaks will be better anyway.",Palm Restaurant,6157427256,3 reviews,2013-07-01,"Franklin, TN",/biz/palm-restaurant-nashville-2,1.0,140,"Washington, DC",Jonathan C.

He also said that Crispy Cream donuts are better than their bag of donuts dessert.  We went with the seven layer chocolate cake which was great.  That being said we did not plan on a two and half hour dining experience which is what dragged down the score,Palm Restaurant,6157427256,40 reviews,2013-01-19,"Canonsburg, PA",/biz/palm-restaurant-nashville-2,3.0,140,"Washington, DC",Jeff S.
"140 5th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"One of my favorite steakhouse's especially when in Nashville. Have been to Palm's in Vegas, Atlanta, Tampa and DC - Nashville is my favorite iteration. The old world clubby atmosphere and professional wait staff always make my visit a pleasure. It's a steakhouse so you can imagine the choices - occaisonally there is an Itialian flare up on the menu...which is very exciting. The crab appitizer is on the verge of decadent and lobster is always a good choice. Steak is, of course, the star here and they usually deliver. Any issues or shortcomings are handled quickly and professionally. Great people watching and on more then one occaision have seen a county music star at the bar or dining room...but don't let the spectre of seeing Kid Rock slurp down oysters frighten you away from going...",Palm Restaurant,6157427256,240 reviews,2012-03-15,"Roswell, GA",/biz/palm-restaurant-nashville-2,5.0,140,"Washington, DC",Helmut B.

"140 5th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Palm is good. Not super fab. And for some reason every time I've gone (before a preds game) the service is mediocre at best. Maybe the NYC-born restaurant kept their NY attitude, but there are other favorites in town that can offer an all around wonderful dining experience. Steak and salad is good.

"140 5th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Having been here many times prior to big events in the Country music world, I dig the crowd and flavors this place offers. First, the bar area is usually bustling with a star studded cast during big nights: Country Music Award, concerts, or simply weekend nights. They make an excellent martini and at the price of $10-15 each, you'll be sure to move on after a few. Second, the food here is on par with an over excessive Americanized serving portion. This, helps justify the cost of the meal. Having been to much more expensive places and received half the serving, I feel the over all portions to price ratio are acceptable on any budget. Third, the staff here are knowledgeable about both the menu and the clientele. Engage them in conversation and they have amazing and fascinating stories to tell. Fourth, if you live in Nashville, bring your our Tupperware. There is definitely food to be brought home. Lastly, get the chocolate cake for desert! One piece here could feed four! Oh, and watch out, this is a tourist destination. That means there is a 25% liquor tax on all adult beverages! I have enjoyed my drinks, meals and conversations here.

However, there is a reason we never eat at the one in Dallas or anywhere else for that matter.  My rare plus steak came out medium plus and was terrible.. tough dry and downright bad.  I took two bites of my half that i split with my son and he did the same before we both pushed it away.  My wife had the seafood pasta with red sauce... No sauce on the pasta and the seafood was minimal at best..that dish was a real shame to serve even at a high school lunch counter.  We also had veal Parmesan which was pretty good, even though you had to eat 3-4 bites of the Fred Flintstones portion to get to the pasta.  Au Gratin potatoes were shocking.. In my many years both in the kitchen and at the table i have never seen mashed potatoes topped with melted cheese referred to and served as Au gratin.. Amazing..

"4017 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I've been just really wanting decent Chinese food. I hoped that this would end up being someplace I could go for simple take out. Honestly, we couldn't even finish our food. We went in and ordered carry out. I got sweet and sour chicken and my guy got pad Thai. After a few bites all I could taste was ginger. At first I was really confused and thought maybe it was in the soy sauce. I tasted some on its own and that wasn't it. The more I ate, the more I realized I was chewing actual pieces of ginger. At that point I was trying to decide if it was in the rice or the chicken. I'm still not totally sure. It could have been in both! It was seriously all I could taste. It was the most bizarre thing. My boyfriend said his food was really greasy and tasted like burnt oil. Once he admit he didn't like his, I let out a sigh of relief and let him know I really couldn't even finish mine. We took our half eaten food downstairs and threw it out. Then we are slices of cake. That was way better. I guess we're still on the search for any decent Chinese food in Nashville. :/I'm honestly not even sure why I gave this place 2 stars since the food was practically inedible.

Her dish showed up and for a second she thought they had screwed up and put chicken on instead of tofu. I had a taste and it was tofu after all, and it was delicious, I'm not a tofu guy so I was really impressed at how good the tofu was!My dish was the caramel chicken. It had the little icon indicating it was spicy, but the heat level was very tame. The dish worked though, and was quite tasty.

"4017 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"Pei Wei is a great place to stop in for lunch or a casual dinner. I visited the one located in Hill Center of Green Hills. We happened to be back on that side of town and were craving some style of Asian food. Pei Wei is considered ""Asian Fusion"" offering a bit of Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese inspired selections. Honestly I trust their quality because they are affiliated with P.F. Changs, their parent company, and offer Gluten-Free items and I know I am getting fresh msg free ingredients.I had the Teriyaki Chicken with white rice (brown rice is an alternative) for ($7). The man had the Spicy Korean Beef ($8.50) over white rice. You can get pretty much any entree with your choice of Beef, Chicken, Tofu, Shrimp or Veggies - I love this option, you can make any dish ligther or heartier and this of course appeals to our vegan and veggie friends out there. The young lady at the counter also mentioned they can mix up any combo as well, veggie/beef or tofu/veggie, etc. this was also a nice alternative to the typical fast food joint. We both had fairly good sized portions and I enjoyed the Mandarin Orange Iced Tea they had on the beverage bar accompanied by fresh oranges. The only disappointment would be the staff's overal lack of attention. I realize that this is not a typical sit down type restaurant, you order your food, it is prepared then brought to you and that is where the service ends. The drinks are self serve, you get your own cutlery and napkins.  I am okay with that, but I was disappointed that when the ""waiters"" saw us struggling with an 8 month old in tow to get a high chair and get situated, they literally walked by several times without offering so much as a glance. A nice woman seated nearby actually reached out to help us out.  I realize they are not earning tips here, but a nice hand would have helped.

"4017 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"Pei Wei is the baby of PF Chang's, and personally my favorite of the two. You can't beat quick takeout, no wait times, and tasty asian cuisine!They offer inside dining with waitstaff, but their takeout seems to be a majority of their business. Pei Wei does have many regular dishes that you can find at PF Changs, like their lettuce wraps and crispy honey shrimp, but at lower prices (less than $10 per dish) and more simpler options. Plus, they have pretty great kids meals with big portions (my mother occasionally chooses from here). I recommend the crab wontons to start, and of course my favorite, the Pad Thai for an entree. The beef and broccoli dish is delicious as well.Make sure you call ahead to order so you don't have to wait inside.

"4017 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"A friend suggested that we come in for a quick bite to eat the other night and although I always try to avoid eating at chain dining establishments...Pei Wei was pretty darn good!The place was packed at around 7:30 in the evening on a Wednesday evening. We were still able to order and have our food delivered to our table within moments. The ginger orange infused iced tea was refreshing and I enjoyed reading our fortune cookies while we waited.Pei Wei offers up Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese dishes. I was very happy with the healthy selection of vegan friendly dishes and tofu substitutions throughout the menu. I decided on the Spicy Korean ($8) which happens to be a nickname that some tend to affectionately call me. I requested that the carrots be excluded from the dish filled with  hot pepper sauce, garlic, white mushrooms, onions, long beans, toasted sesame seeds, and tofu. I was happy when a large serving of carrot-less goodness arrived at our table. The tofu was firm and thinly sliced and full of flavor and my stomach was full after eating just 1/2 of the portion. It's always nice to have lunch ready for the next day! I should also point out that the staff was very friendly and conversational throughout our visit.Pei Wei is priced fairly, has quick service, and has a nice interior. They earn closer to a solid 3.5 stars on my meter. I would consider this a good place for a casual lunch.I don't think that I will go out of my way to go to Pei Wei but if I happened to be at the Hill Center or Green Hills Mall and heard my tummy growling.....*TIP*If you go onto the company website, you can place your order online and select delivery times/dates as well.

"4017 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"So this is basically PF Chang's type food at a cheaper price.  I like that premise, but the thing is that I don't like PF Chang's food that much.  Overall it's too salty and over-sauced.  The other down-side is that it stays pretty packed.  It's not uncommon to see a line go outside the restaurant.  They have a good variety and they get you your food faster than at PF Chang's.  I admit that this place is perfect for people who are new to Asian food.  Regardless, arm yourself with a lot of water and prepare to be bloated the next morning from all the sodium.  For that I won't come back.",Pei Wei,6155143230,95 reviews,2011-07-24,"Nashville, TN",/biz/pei-wei-nashville-2,2.0,76,"Washington, DC",Simon K.

My friend loved her Beef and Broccoli, and another friend said her Ginger Chicken was a bit too strong, but still pretty good.The ""servers"" really got on my nerves. I guess they are really not servers because they just bring your food out to you, then disappear. People kept walking by our table asking ""Can I get you anything?"" This happened every minute or two. No joke. I understand trying to turn your tables, but this was too much.

I have a hard time finding good Asian food here in Nashville, so when I find something I love I don't usually try other places, because I have had a lot of horrible Asian food here.

"411 BroadwayNashville, TN 37246",3.5,"Lower Broad doesn't always seem the most local-friendly of Nashville locations what with the endless woo-hooing of bachelorette parties and boot stores but, as things grow, Broadway becomes a place locals will flock to even when not hosting out-of-towners. The draw for some may be the views. The draw for some may be the music. At Paradise Park, you'll wander in because you're drunk and in need of delicious, greasy food that will right your ship. Lucky for you, there are some additional benefits to take in.But, first and foremost, get some food and sober up, willya? After winning a challenge to drink all the booze, I didn't think it was a good idea to get in to the first Uber I called. I'd like to be able to keep using the service. So, being in the area, I used my handy dandy app to figure out where to get a greasy grub on. Paradise Park, it was. One of the first things I noticed was that the venue is a lot larger than it seems from the outside -- and there's a lot going on. They've gone all in to/for the trailer motif and it works. It's self-referential. It's funny. And, it's local. In Boston, I'd want to torch a place like this. Here, I shrug, admit to some truths and keep it moving. I stumbled to the counter and started talking to the young lady who was posted up there. This wasn't her first time at the rodeo and I'm sure I wasn't her first drunk of the night. Despite all this, she treated me with nothing but kindness and patience; I don't know that I could have done the same in her shoes. She walked me through the menu (there's more to choose from than you might think) and I settled on what had to be done: bacon cheeseburger (no mayo) and cheese tots. Cheese.Tots. Done.As I waited, I a.) washed my hands in the men's room (very clean; this is a major plus) and b.) got to listen to the band that was rocking out. Un-ironically (I think) they were having a go at an '80s hair band thing and, screaming aside, I was impressed with their musicianship. There's so much talent in this city. It's a shame what you hear on the radio. There's business and there's talent and the two don't always meet up. No longer did I ponder the inequities of the entertainment biz because my bounty was ready. I settled up, smiled & thanked my counter-lady and went on my way. One Uber ride later and I was ready to dig in.Oh.Yes.I don't eat bacon cheeseburgers all the time (not that you can tell) but when I do, I want them like this: juicy patty, gobs of melty cheese, crisp (not chewy) bacon, lettuce, onion, tomato, pickle, ketchup, and mustard. As the perfect accompaniment to my burger, my cheese tots were just what the doctor ordered* to keep me belly-licious and sate my drAnkin' needs. PP is what it is and if you treat it accordingly, it will treat you right back. I have no doubts that this dalliance will happen again.*No doctor would ever order these.",Paradise Park,6152511515,1642 reviews,2015-09-10,"Nashville, TN",/biz/paradise-park-nashville,4.0,151,"Washington, DC",Johnny T.

They were ready in 26 seconds but I was eating raw potatoes. Also, the band was incredibly brazen, demanding $30 to continue playing the song they strummed a few notes of. Someone caved in to their incessant bullying, and then the lead singer announced that they didn't even know how to play the song and would wing it.

"411 BroadwayNashville, TN 37246",3.5,"I could totally see Guy Fieri barrel out of his red, open-top convertible and walk in here with his sunglasses pulled to the back of his bulbous head and his bleached hair in full spike, wolf down the burger and proclaim it as being ""off the hook"". Then the camera and lights go off, and he spits the whole thing out of his mouth as he moves on to the next generic diner, drive-in or dive. With its faded teal neon sign, Paradise Park looks like the perfect fit on Broadway with all the honky tonk bars, western gear stores and BBQ joints in the area. It turns out to have a split personality as half of it is a fast food spot while the other half is a long bar with a live band on a slightly elevated stage performing in front of an audience of three (photo: bit.ly/1OEDvHh).We were here to eat because we missed the complimentary breakfast back at the hotel. Unless you count the post-hangover Frito Pie, there wasn't much on the menu that said breakfast to us (photo: bit.ly/1HTiuZw). At the front counter, we found the woman with the pony-tail and the Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey shirt a hoot (photo: bit.ly/1Dchlpn). When I asked her if she recommended the Spam Sandwich, she gave me a sideways look from her fashion-backward glasses and said that every time she passed by the Spam in the kitchen, it made her want to hurl because her momma made it throughout her entire childhood. So I assumed that was not a recommendation. Instead, I ordered the $8.49 Singlewide Cheeseburger.It was a one-third-pound Angus patty with chopped onions, shredded lettuce, a couple of beefsteak tomato slices, and a slice of melted American cheese. In other words, it was your typical roadside diner burger, greasier than most, and I ordered a $1.99 side of Tater Tots instead of the fries (photo: bit.ly/1GhLrzd). Turned out to be a smart move because the tots were the best part of the meal with the burger having unfortunate side effects on me later that day. Jamie fared marginally better with the $8.49 Paradise Patty Melt, which took the same patty and saddled it with melted Swiss cheese and caramelized onions between two slices of rye (photo: bit.ly/1G5mfGw). The big orange naugahyde booths were roomy (photo: bit.ly/1GhLP0H), but it was starting to crowd quickly.

You know that situation. You just gotta get the hell out. Even if that means that you won't get to obsessively stare at the little dots as they painfully light up the perimeter of that fake quarter-mile track that you're pacing around.Not sure what happened at Paradise Park but that kind of happened, so we left. I think we would have stayed longer otherwise.Side note: don't look up at the vents. I said DON'T! JUST DON'T!You won't listen to me.

"411 BroadwayNashville, TN 37246",3.5,"I would like to preface this review by stating that I did not eat here, but only made this a stop during a night of drinking down Broadway with the wife. That being said- as a beer and moonshine drinking, NASCAR fan from Florida- this is MY kind of bar. Cheap drinks, trashy decor, and a fun-loving crowd of good people.Went on a Friday night and the place was PACKED- but no cover and friendly bouncers. After wading through a crowd to get to the back of the place, we finally found an empty spot to stand. I was very surprised at the amount of draft beers available, and they had some great specials on bottled beers as well. We lucked out and grabbed a table as some folks left, and we were surprised to learn that we had a server who would take our drink orders for us! How awesome is that! You didn't have to get up from the table and wade through a crowd to order drinks, she just got our order, and was back within 2 minutes with a refill of delicious beer. I loved that.We ended up inviting a few guys to sit at our table with us since we had the extra room, and made some new friends while sharing some drinks. The live music was pretty good, and the crowd was well behaved and having a good time. Pair that with cheap drinks, great service, and a laid-back trashy atmosphere, and it equals a fun night out on the town. I had a blast here, Highly recommended- especially if you can come out on a weeknight when the crowds aren't bad, but even when it's packed, it's still a blast.",Paradise Park,6152511515,504 reviews,2014-09-09,"St. Augustine, FL",/biz/paradise-park-nashville,4.0,151,"Washington, DC",Matt S.

I came to Paradise Park looking for a relaxing evening for one after a past few days of too much honky tonking and networking. Paradise Park contains, among other things: gross carpet, a bit of a smoke smell, an old car, and some old  television parts. In other words, it's basically my grandfather's basement. I figured this would be a laid back, less crowded place and while I was right, this certainly does not mean it was not fun. I ended up having an unexpected blast, rocking out to the cover band  that refused to play country and watching people of all types dance like crazy with enough room to do so. I didn't try try the food but  Paradise Park had a decent amount of drafts and a super friendly staff. I was told it gets pretty crowded on weeknights, but on a quiet Wednesday, this disgustingly carpeted place was full of good times with plenty of breathing room.But II hope I didn't breathe too much of the mildew from the green carpet. ...I know. I'm obsessing. I spent the first portion of my night here alone-plenty of time to concentrate on the carpet. ...I wrote a yelp talk thread trying to find out the name of this place, because yes, I had such a good time, I didn't bother to learn the name.

"411 BroadwayNashville, TN 37246",3.5,"You know that place you went to in college to get a bite at 2 am after the bars closed down? Fortunately, you can relive that experience at Paradise Park. Located on Broadway, in the middle of all the bars, it's one of the few places that serves food into the early morning hours and seems to be full of those trying to soak up large amounts of alcohol consumed over the last few hours. Actually, the food isn't that bad, when comparing to McDonald's type restaurants. It's close to a Waffle House experience where you see the cook slap your burger on the grill after you order. This isn't a nice, sit down restaurant with table service. It's cheap food meant to be consumed with and after alcohol and when you compare it to other establishments that are similar how can you complain? The buns are even better than you get at a fast-food place. Their BBQ sauce isn't bad - at all. And, the burgers are edible as are the fries and sweet potato fries. I ordered the turkey and shockingly enjoyed it. It wasn't some packaged turkey, it tasted like fresh shaved turkey and came on bread that had substance.

Fortunately, we had that excuse this weekend, which reminded me to write this past-due review.PPTR earns props for always having a fun band (not just country either-they busted out a late 90s medley this weekend that made me want to dig out some Abercrombie and Fitch), great bartenders, and probably most importantly, SPACE. The back of the bar has long tables that can seat eightish, and the generous standing room let's you relax.

"411 BroadwayNashville, TN 37246",3.5,"Ahh, Paradise Park- what a great name for this place. It reminds me of where I'd like to spend eternity. Just kidding, this place is a shithole. But in a good, on-purpose way. Again, as with most bars on Broadway, I don't advise going if you are not up for a raucous time and have done the necessary booze drinking to have fun in a place like this. The last time I made a stop at Paradise, I swore I was only going in for a few minutes to say hello to some friends. Four hours later I realized I was sadly mistaken, but had a blast listening to the house band, drinking pitchers of beer, and milling about with the assorted crowd. The astroturf, plastic lawn furniture, and beat-up car in the front of the bar make for an interesting environment until you realize no one even notices it after five minutes of being there. I guess Paradise just has that mind-numbing effect on people.

"411 BroadwayNashville, TN 37246",3.5,"WHAT? HOLD ON...I CAN'T FREAKING HEAR YOU...I'M IN PARADISE PARK AND IT'S THE LOUDEST FREAKING BAR I'VE EVER BEEN IN. HOLD ON, LET ME STEP INTO THE RESTROOM TO DO THE REST OF THIS REVIEW...Ahh. That's much better. Wait...this is a trailer park bar...why is there an attendant in the restroom? I can squirt my own soap and no, I do not want a splash of Calvin Klein's Indifference.But anyway...Paradise Park is a trailer park themed bar in the old Heilig Meyers building. I'm not exactly sure who had the brilliant concept of making a bar in downtown Nashville themed like everyone thought Nashville was already themed...but there you go.The first thing you notice (if you go in on the bar side) is there is a giant wrecked racecar sitting right in the middle of the floor. When it comes to decor, this place hasn't heard of it. You're allowed to Sharpie and carve on pretty much anything in the place...so the walls and tables look like a men's restroom - let's just say there's an abundance of drawings of genitalia.The second thing you notice is how loud it is. That's because there's a live band. And the live band generally sucks. So your ears are being assaulted with just horrific sounds. Then they have the balls to come around saying that they work for tips, blah blah blah. As if you had to tell me...But enough about that. Here's the strange part - I actually like the place. It's extremely laid back, if you can ever get the bartender's attention. The food is pretty good. They have sweet potato fries there, which I think are fantastic...of course, sometimes you have to yell to get your order in...One thing though...due to its location right smack in the middle of Broadway, it's a tourist haven. I mean, you're on Broadway, there are windows open and there's live music coming out. Steve and Debbie from Wichita are going to come your way, let's be honest.You'll go in there...you'll be like, ""This is the trashiest place that's not really trashy that I've ever been in..."" and for some reason, you'll keep coming back.",Paradise Park,6152511515,72 reviews,2011-05-26,"Franklin, TN",/biz/paradise-park-nashville,4.0,151,"Washington, DC",Patten F.

"411 BroadwayNashville, TN 37246",3.5,"I always make a pit stop in the Paradise Park Lounge when out and about Honky Tonkin' in the weird city of Nashvegas. Not sure if its the food cart in the middle of the restaurant, the car in the middle of the restaurant that has been abused by drunken punches and vomit, or the bathtubs as coolers behind the bar. Sprawling from Broadway through the initial crowd past the bar there are actually pool tables in the back. They too have seen better days but what more could you ask for from a trailer park?  Relaxed desperation is how I would describe the vibe in the dive and I can't get enough.The liquids are cheap and there is a ever flowing waterfall to quinch whatever thirst you may have. Be on the lookout for happy hour specials and so on. I mentioned the food cart in the middle of the restaurant earlier. It holds a special place in my heart right next to their amazing greasy cheeseburgers and crinkle cut fries which help you carry on into the wee hours or soak up the leftover suds the next morning. After hours, or when the adults are raucous and out playing, they separate the bar area and restaurant side with a chain link fence allowing the minors to get the good grease late at night too.

"411 BroadwayNashville, TN 37246",3.5,"If I could rate this place with less than 1 star I would.I live in Chicago and was in Nashville for business; however, after visiting this place I am asking myself ""Where is the southern hospitality AND is chivalry dead?"" After patronizing a local honkeytonk my Nashville contacts opted to grab a bite at Paradise Park. The food was what you would expect from a burger joint with a rather large selection of the greasy spoon variety.  The sweet potato fries were tasty.  It is the atmosphere and the service and attitude of the personnel that has me baffled.  A group of 6 of us ordered burgers, fries, tater tots and grilled cheese sandwiches and found a table in the front enclosed patio. At the time we visited the establishment they had the front door propped open. I may live in Chicago but the weekend temperature was unseasonal for the south at roughly 29 degrees Fahrenheit.  With the unseasonably cold ambient air temperatures filtering inside we asked site personnel to close the door, they refused. Several minutes later when my fingers felt like ice cubes, burning and numb from cold exposure, I walked to the entry and closed the front door.

We only went in to the restaurant portion of the place and not the bar area. The cooks and the cashier looked a little bored since we were their only customers. The woman who took our order was very friendly and told us what was good. It's diner food. I was really happy they had tater tots on the menu. You could see the kitchen area which I sometimes think is good. At least that way you can see what they are doing back there.Paradise Park kind of had a Waffle House vibe except the restaurant is huge.

"411 BroadwayNashville, TN 37246",3.5,"This bar probably only deserves 3 stars on its own, but part of a Nashville Nightlife Experience is the band, and the band there ROCKS!As a theme bar, they do well in keeping their Trailer Park/White Trash theme extremely mild and fairly understated. They have a well stocked bar and lots of good cold beer - a bit on the pricey side, but not so bad for the Lower Broadway area. When you enter the bar, you enter into the smoking area  -something I could have done without - and when you leave, you go back through the thick wall of cigarette smoke, but inside the main part of the bar is a huge non-smoking area.If you get there early enough, you might be lucky to snag on of the booths, which are long, deep affairs that can easily seat 10-15, but for the most part were taken by small groups of 4-6 (at least on a Saturday night they were.) Otherwise, there are seats at the bar or standing room.Every place in the bar has a pretty good view of the band, and again, they are an attraction all their own. Good Southern rock with a woman fiddle player that truly jams. She is not only the focal point that glues you to their music, but she also acts as the backbone of a lot of their songs, blending in well behind the band when she is not out in front.I'll have to remember t shower before going to bed next time so my sheets don't smell like smoke, but we'll for sure be back.",Paradise Park,6152511515,147 reviews,2010-12-23,"Hendersonville, TN",/biz/paradise-park-nashville,4.0,151,"Washington, DC",Stuart W.

Not to mention the green astro-turf flooring and authentic redneck smell.

"411 BroadwayNashville, TN 37246",3.5,"Not sure what the deal with bars themed as trailer/white trash lately.. Sf had white trash bistro, aka butter.. Nashville has Paradise park...Terribly gross bar, yes i know thats what they are going or, but even if you theme is to be trashy, aren't there still health standards?This was a bar we found ourself at for a drink as I showed a couple of guest from SF downtown and broadway... we really just wanted a drink or two since it was hot as all hell and everything else was obviously honky tonk bars... Stunk... first thing that pops to mind is the stink that seemed to be coming from everywhere... some drunk guy was on stage playing oasis covers which was only weird because he was studded out like a cowboy... the food, well i wouldnt imagine the people that actually go here to eat... ack.. anyway we grabbed a beer and headed back to the open air front room and got a kick out of the wall of mullets...  then we got even more of a kick of the people sitting next to us... you would have to believe the bar owner went out to the closest trailer park and rounded up a few locals with the offer of $7 cash and free beer to hang out and make the place seem authentic...

"411 BroadwayNashville, TN 37246",3.5,"I remember when Paradise Park opened thinking that this was exactly what downtown needed, yet another celebration of redneck ridiculousness. With a beat up car nestled inside the bar (If anyone wonders who finalized the collapse of the roof, that would be me) and a wall dedicated to mullets, I think the décor of Paradise Park really speaks for itself. Bar none, Paradise Park's biggest draw is its $6 dollar pitchers, yes you heard right, $6. With a different option every day (for example, Saturdays you can enjoy a $6 pitcher of PBR), nothing makes me happier than trying to stumble around with an entire pitcher in hand. The place does get ridiculously crowded, and the blasting country cover songs can be ear piercing, but if anything it should provide an interesting the night. The crowd tends to be fantastically amusing with a hilarious mix of college kids, bikers, bachelorette parties, wannabe cowboys, and loners.  I wouldn't get food there because it's ridiculously overpriced and over-greased, but God bless them for their $6 pitchers.",Paradise Park,6152511515,328 reviews,2008-10-27,"San Francisco, CA",/biz/paradise-park-nashville,3.0,151,"Washington, DC",Mariela C.

"1602 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"My boss and I have been coming here for lunch at least once a week for the past couple of years.  We loved the lunch specials, great prices and great food.  However, earlier this year they took away the lunch specials and some of our favorite options.  Last week we were told there would be a new menu coming out so we went today thinking it would be there and we were anxious to check it out.  First off, we walk a couple blocks to get there.  We walked in and sat in our usual spot and it was stifling in there- seemed to be no AC and just one ineffective fan blowing.  Our drink order was taken, my boss didn't get his until he asked for it once the food arrived, which took much longer than usual.  I get the chicken shawarma pocket- and was appalled to see pickles on it!  There are usually big slices of onion which I just remove, but I abhor pickles and their smell and juices!  I don't want them touching my food and I don't even want to touch them!  The chicken looked completely different than I'm used to and I get hummus as a side and they only gave me two triangles of pita (opposed the the normal four they usually give).  My boss had the falafel pocket, same complaints with the pickles and for some reason the falafel was very green inside, we'd never seen it like that before.  It will be a while before we go back, sadly.  I pretty much decided that after my boss had to ask for his drink and I saw the pickles.  It was off to both of us, a shame to lose yet another lunch place we enjoy (Bosco's closed last year, that was another weekly fave).",Mediterranean Cuisine,6153218980,4 reviews,2015-08-04,"Mt Juliet, TN",/biz/mediterranean-cuisine-nashville-2,3.0,26,"Washington, DC",Kerri R.

"510 Church StNashville, TN 37219",3.0,Overall not bad. Food good but not great. Good lunch spot for those who work downtown and are within walking distance.  Not sure I would make a special trip here. Strengths:Diverse menu for a large group of people in your party.

"510 Church StNashville, TN 37219",3.0,"""Taza -- It Means Fresh!!"" Taza was not our first option, but every place we attempted to try to eat at that night had a long wait or a pricey cover. Do yourself a favor and KEEP WALKING. Every stereotypically bad thing you can imagine about a restaurant is going on at Tazza. Tazza is not branded well. Is it American? Italian? Seafood? Mexican? Middle Eastern? It has food from all these categories, and more...Tazza is DARK. Not romantic dark -- dark like, we haven't cleaned our floors, walls, tables or chairs in years and we don't want you to see what's growing/moving on them.Tazza is broken. The booths we were seated in sagged so low our faces were near the table. We should have RUN AWAY THEN but we were cold and tired. We moved to a table...Tazza is tedious. The menu is 120 items, at least! The text is so small you must squint. Lobster and Steak, together for less than $25? If it's too good to be true, it is.Tazza is unflattering to itself. Upon asking for some guidance with the food, the only server working gave us the list of what NOT to order. Gee, thanks.Tazza is empty. On the Saturday night we ate here, we were the only people there besides the sketchy teens who showed up near close (see below).Tazza is sketchy. Some teenagers showed up, helped themselves into the kitchen, sat down at a table with some food, and left without payment. The restaurant's slogan was something like ""It Means Fresh!"". There is nothing FRESH about Tazza. The pasta is microwaved, the pizza is soggy, the burgers were frozen before we ordered them, and most of the menu consists of bland fried items.

No exaggeration, dime sized shrimp and there were only 3 in the entire order. The menu specifically states large shrimp with olive oil, garlic, fresh basil and tomatoes. Doesn't even MENTION cheese. No large shrimp, no basil, just tons of dried oregano and cheese. I actually threw it away, which hurt my soul because it was 12 dollars. The side salad I ordered with it was absolutely worthless as well. Croutons were stale and the whole thing was prepackaged. The 1000 Island dressing I got with it was turned.

"510 Church StNashville, TN 37219",3.0,"Tazza is one downtown restaurant that is doing things right.  Their menu is extensive and the restaurant has a very good looking dining room full of tables with white tables clothes.  The vibe is very intimate and lively with warm red and yellow colors on the wall and  warm lighting above all the tables.  Tazza is one of the nicer places to grab lunch, and they even rate well as a dinner place. Their menu includes dozens of pasta dishes, fish plates, dozens of salads, specialty pizzas, and desserts.  They are one  place downtown that maintains evening and weekend hours. I had a really great lunch with friends here on a Saturday.Their house coffee was a really great Italian roast, just what I needed to perk me up after sleeping in too late... Then I had their spicy Thai chicken salad, it was pretty tasty. I love the hot and cold texture of the Thai chicken and the crisp cold romaine lettuce.  If you want a more traditional Italian dish there are plenty of options to choose from.  They have several types of Manicotti which my friends really enjoyed. Their prices for lunch are a little higher than other places downtown but the quality of the food really speaks for itself.  Bring your sack lunch for a few days and then treat yourself to Tazza.  Or bring your boss here to try and butter them up for your next promotion.",Tazza,6157423223,247 reviews,2008-04-08,"Nashville, TN",/biz/tazza-nashville,4.0,73,"Washington, DC",Sharon K.
"510 Church StNashville, TN 37219",3.0,"On nights where I had to get work done, or felt anti-social and didn't want to hang out with anyone, or got in the night before everyone else and had no one with whom to be social, I would order from Tazza, a recommendation from the hotel staff.When you look at the menu, you realize there's a lot going on. It's hard to choose when you have about five pages of choices to choose from. It's a case of a small business trying to cater to too many tastes. It's even more overwhelming when you factor in dessert, which I never got to.The first time I ordered from them, I had it delivered to my room. Waiting for 45 minutes for food when you're hungry now is a bit of a downer, but they were nice enough to give me my drink for free. I ordered a ""small"" stromboli and a pasta, which barely fit in the mini-fridge in my room when I had leftovers. The 'boli was good, but the sauce in the pasta was a little bland.The second time I ordered, I went to pick it up, hoping to cut down on the wait time (20 minutes). Again, I ordered the pasta, hoping that the first time was a fluke, along with a cheeseburger and fries, which I'm told is their specialty. The burger was massive and good, but the fries were a little soggy. And sadly, the pasta sauce was still bland.The prices were okay, only because of the sheer volume of food involved. Still, I'd be okay paying the same amount for less but better tasting food.",Tazza,6157423223,24 reviews,2009-04-05,"Quincy, MA",/biz/tazza-nashville,2.0,73,"Washington, DC",Ben M.

I tried a Cajun pasta that was to die for and every thing is so fresh (hints the name which means fresh lol). I'm not sure if the other things on the menu are good but I would definitely go back just for the pasta again.

We ate here during the ""giant snowstorm of 2010"" or whatever they're calling it. The menu is indeed WAY too large, as others have pointed out. I really hate that, as there's no way to do that many dishes well. Given the size of the menu, we asked for recommendations. The helpful and attentive waiter told us that the Goat Cheese and Walnut Salad was good as well as the Chicken Salad Sandwich. He also recommended the soup of the day, Potato Soup. We ordered as per his instructions. I enjoyed the specified salad and potato soup, while Co-Diner #1 said she liked her chicken salad sandwich although her cheese soup was barely warm. Co-Diner #2 indicated that the Tazza Apple Chicken Salad was very large (yes, yes it was), but seemed to enjoy it enough to eat most of it. We liked that the dressings were served on the side, so that we could choose the amount. Finally, we tried the peach cobbler for dessert. We got some sort of mushy thing (almost bread pudding?) that we really couldn't eat (but the ice cream was good).

I don't think they've ever gotten the actual dressing I've ordered in with the salad and sometimes it comes with the cheese, sometimes not, I've never had it with peanuts but the chicken is great.

"510 Church StNashville, TN 37219",3.0,"I'll start with the good. Convenient downtown location. We walked from our hotel. Extensive menu selection.Now the bad.  We went here with a group of  11 people.  There were two other tables occupied in the restaurant. One had a single diner, the other had two people.  Not a lunch rush by any means.  We all ordered off the menu, no special requests.  The first entree was served and it looked pretty decent. Stuffed shells. Two other entrees came out.  About 5 minutes later, a few more entrees came out.  Repeat until everyone has their food, over about 20 minutes.  The first guy served had finished his lunch before the last person got their meal on the table.  And he wasn't some ravenous hyena who gobbled his food down. He ate in a normal fashion, it just took that long.  I got the house salad. It was ok, but had a few extra ingredients that were not on the menu.  Hubby had the chicken marsala. The chicken was pan fried and hard on the outside (this was a common theme in many of our meals) and the marsala sauce was basically oil. Didn't taste good.  The last person waiting for her food got something totally different from what she ordered. How do you ask for Chicken fettucini alfredo and end up with spinach fettcini in pesto sauce? And the waiter brought it out and had the nerve to say ""It's not really what you ordered, but will you eat it anyway?"" She said no because she doesn't like spinach (which is why she didn't order that).  The waiter took it back and finally almost an hour after ordering got her proper dish. And then it was not very tasty.At the end, the waiter split the bills. He told us the credit card machine was down, and he'd copy down our card number, have us sign a blank voucher, and charge it later.  Dude, are you smoking crack? We might all be from out of town, but we're not stupid! Sign a blank voucher and charge you later... That would get the cops called on you in California.  Anyway, we went to get cash, and instead of leaving the bill, he took it back.  When hubby got back with the cash, he brought us the wrong bill. We tried to tell him, but after waiting 15 minutes for the correct one and for him to come out of wherever he was hiding, we just paid the bill he brought us and left.

Finally someone took our orders, but we didn't get our food until half an hour later. Kind of slow for a crowd that wasn't doing much eating, in my opinion. Every time we needed something, we had to wave down our server because she never came to check on us, and after we had paid for our meals and beers, she handed us our cards back while chewing food in her mouth... What?!Too bad the service was not all that great, because I had the ""hot chicken chunks"" and they were actually pretty good.

"4109 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I usually frequent the midtown Corner Pub location but I live closer to this one so I finally walked over to give it a try.  I wish I hadn't decided to do this in a torrential downpour, but that's a story for another day.First thing I noticed is that this place is quite a bit smaller than the other location but that makes it cozy.  Numerous tables, seating at the bar, and an outdoor patio all await you.  The place was packed on Monday for happy hour.  Drink specials and menu specials throughout the week can be found on the flat screen TV that flips through the information mixed in with pictures of party times.  And apparently we like party times because we knew people in two of the pictures.  There are also TVs everywhere for all of your sporting event watching.  Clientele seemed to be neighborhood people of all ages - from kids to grandmas - out to have a drink or two and get some food.  No smoking inside so it is safe for the kiddos if you want to bring them along.  Although it still has that bar feel so keep that in mind if you don't want your kids growing up to be a barfly like me!!Menu appeared to be the same as the midtown location as well.  I ordered a BLT with sweet potato fries.  Yum!  I didn't know they had sweet potato fries and they were delicious.  BLT was, of course, awesome since anything with bacon is immediately a salty, meaty taste sensation.  I like mine with mustard rather than mayo.  Not too much bacon, maybe could have used a couple more pieces, but overall there's nothing to complain about.  Our waitress was friendly but she was kind of slooooow.  It was kind of busy though so that's ok but if I'd been trying to get my drink on I would have been frustrated.Overall I liked this location of Corner Pub but I wasn't in love with it.  However, I want to become more intimately involved since I live so close....and I'm sure once I am they will get more stars.",The Corner Pub,6152989698,1027 reviews,2011-07-19,"Nashville, TN",/biz/the-corner-pub-nashville,3.0,34,"Washington, DC",Nickie G.

"415 W Thompson LnNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"We had 2 of the Meat and Veg combinations to try everything. I think it was number 12 or 23. Sorry can't remember. To start had the Ayib Begomen Farmer's cheese mixed w/ collard greens, spiced butter, & a touch of mia-mita (chili powder). Served over toasted Italian bread. There were 4 pieces. Tasted like farmers cheese with spices. -OK to try, but may not have again. Would have liked to try the Sambusa's- I think similar to Samosa's. Next time..So we had the Qey-W'et -  Fresh, tender beef stew w/ onion, garlic, fresh ginger, berbere, hot pepper & spiced butter. MY FAVORITE OF ALL DISHES. Yebeg Alicha -Tender pieces of lamb simmered in mild sauce & seasoned w/ fresh ginger, garlic & tumeric.Doro w'et. Not a lamb person, but if you like lamb, this would be considered very good. Doro W'et  Two chicken legs marinated in lemon juice, then sauteed in spiced butter & seasoned w/ pepper garlic, onions, fresh ginger & spices. Served w/ a hard-boiled egg. I only remember one chicken leg. Spice was good, but did not simmer into the chicken, but still very good. Spices went into the egg. Minchet Abish (Deqa)Finely chopped prime beef, sauteed in butter & simmered in hot sauce seasoned w/ spices & fresh herbs. This to me was not memorable or my taste buds were done after I went around to this one. `Miser W'et-Split lentils cooked w/ onion, garlic, & ginger in house special sauces & hot pepper. -Also not memorable, spiced lentils is what I remember. Kik Aletcha Yellow split peas cooked w/ fresh ginger, garlic, & onion & finished w/ turmeric sauce. These were tasty, but I def could not just eat veg's alone here, bc the meats are very good.  Shiro W'et Ground & highly seasoned chickpeas cooked w/ onion & garlic. Also spicy, but very fine ground, but not like hummas. Ye'atkilt W'et  Fresh string beans, carrots, & onions sauteed in flavorful mild sauce. - Very good, but just had some amazing green beens in Cali  so was still thinking of those. Presentation was nice with the Injera under the whole plate and basket of it. My partner used a lot the Injera at first and I tried to tell him to ease off because it expands in your stomach. Really spongy How do they make it?Service was very good. We had water, wish I knew about the coffee. NEXT TIME. Parking was easy in the back and there were 2 taxi cabs parked. Hmmm 1 looked like the car that took me from the airport. Will go back for the buffet as it is very affordable, Dinner was also for such a lovely meal.  Really really wish I had the coffee.

"415 W Thompson LnNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"I reserved Gojo for a party of 25 folks and we had a blast here! We had a welcome dinner that I was planning and wanted things to be particularly arranged. Gojo did a fantastic job of accommodating us. The first time I went by Gojo, I had a hard time locating them. They have a small sign in the front which can be easy to miss if you're just driving by on Thompson Lane. I had to turn around and come back! They had small private parking area in the back so don't get worked up about the busy street parking. The inside of Gojo has lots of traditional Ethiopian decorations. It looks quite lovely! It smells even better. Although they are a small family owned restaurant, they can cater for 200+ people and so if you want to use them for an event, make sure to reserve early. I did not but thank goodness they were able to add me on to their handwritten calendar. :) On the day of the event, I went in with a couple of welcome signs that I wanted to leave someone visible. They literally took the signs from me and stapled them on to their own walls. The owner then asked me if that was visible enough. I have never been to a restaurant where they let you hang outside, handmade posters for your event so this was an amazing gesture on their part! During the event, they went to each table and explained the food options to our friends. They also came by frequently to fill waters for all 25 people. They had arranged the seats to ensure we had a whole room which gave us some privacy as well. Their food, perhaps obvious from my five stars, was REALLY good. We ordered a couple of the two meat and two vegetable platters. Each of these served three people and came with lots of breads. While we ate with our hands, we liked the option of being given some utensils. If you go individually or simply want your own dish versus family style, there are smaller dishes as well. After the meal, the owner and his wife (the chef) sat me down and made me some tea while we sorted the bill. How wonderful of them! They told me about the history of the business and about themselves. I suddenly realized that I had forgotten our tax exempt paper at home. The owners just gave me their card and asked me to call them the next day with the account number. I was completely taken aback by how trusting their were of someone they just met a couple of hours ago. Given my schedule, I completely forgot to call these folks back the next day and give them the number. No worries, they give me a call themselves! Overall, amazing service.

We have ordered a number of things of the menu and have never been disappointed. I will warn you traditional Ethiopian food is eaten with your fingers. Utensils will not be brought to the table when your food is brought out. They will be brought to the table upon request but it's way more fun to eat with your fingers. Not having utensils adds to the experience. My husband and I had hot tea at the end of our meal. It was delicious and complimented the food very well I highly recommend it. The building is interesting it's definitely a hole in the wall. It's got mismatched tables and chairs but it's great. Their prices are very reasonable and we always leave happy tummys and wallets. They are child friendly we haven't brought our one year old. But they do have high chairs and we have seen a little 9 month old boy there with his family. They waitress was very interactive with him.

"415 W Thompson LnNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"I've been eating Ethiopian food for 30 years now so I've sampled my share of injera. We're new in Nashville and were delighted to find Gojo just a mile from my wife's office (thanks Yelp!). Like most Ethiopian places, Gojo's decor is understated and it's not fancy - it's all about the food. Which is delicious. We split the ground beef sambussa appetizer, which was fine, but did nothing in particular for me.The vegetarian combo (my ""go-to, first test"" at any Ethiopian place) was spot-on. Lentils, split-peas, green-bean carrot medley, greens (collards, perhaps) were all cooked and spiced perfectly. The vibe inside was friendly, laid-back - you felt like you could sit over tea or coffee for two hours and they wouldn't care (or would overtly approve). Speaking of which, the party next to us had the ""coffee service"", which includes incense and coffee which will cause you to ""see through time"" ((c) Lisa Simpson). It looked and smelled delicious.For those who have never been to an Ethiopian restaurant, I think it's the perfect place to take kids if they're a little adventurous (or need to be a little more adventurous). It's rare that kids get to grab food with their fingers and this tastes better and is more nutritious than pizza or fried chicken. We'll definitely have to check out some of Nashville's other Ethiopian spots but this is right at the top of our list either for an easy going ""I don't feel like cooking"" evening or a place to take out of town guests who have had their fill of barbecue.",Gojo Ethiopian,6153320710,5 reviews,2015-06-18,"Douglas, Isle of Man",/biz/gojo-ethiopian-nashville,5.0,124,"Washington, DC",Lee J.

We love Ethiopian food and had been wondering if we would be able to find a good source for it here. Gojo has more than exceeded our expectations every time we've been. A small staff means the service can be a bit slow on busy nights but the food is well worth the wait. And while they don't serve alcohol, they do allow you to bring in your own bottle(s) of wine to enjoy with your meal. It's worth noting that Gojo is not a big place so bear that in mind when you're deciding when/what night to go. Everything we've sampled has also been reasonably priced.",Gojo Ethiopian,6153320710,7 reviews,2015-06-03,"Nashville, TN",/biz/gojo-ethiopian-nashville,5.0,124,"Washington, DC",Anna G.
"415 W Thompson LnNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"This place could very easily  get bumped up to 5 stars next time I go, but we waited for 30 minutes before getting greeted by our server and when we did get service, the guy was argumentative about the menu. I am not one who needs a song and dance (especially when eating ethnic food) so the service wasn't that big of a deal. It definitely has room for improvement, hence my writing this much about it. Onto the food, I should preface this by saying that I love Ethiopian food, and the food here is legit! The bread was really tasty, as was the lamb and the cabbage. I look forward to returning very soon! It's BYOB, BTW.",Gojo Ethiopian,6153320710,10 reviews,2014-09-27,"Nashville, TN",/biz/gojo-ethiopian-nashville,4.0,124,"Washington, DC",Maggie W.
"415 W Thompson LnNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"I was on my way back from Trader Joes when my roommate mentioned that he had never tried Ethiopian food before. It took me about 2 seconds before I pulled up Yelp to find out where we needed to book to STAT. Per yelp, Gojo was recommended. We went at 11:30 and were definitely the first ones there. Gojo is located in an area of town that I would love to venture back to given the high density of ethnic restaurants. Or.. if you are interested, pawn shops. When we first approached the restaurant, I was unsure if it was open.. or if we were even at the right place. I took that as a good sign as I would like for a restaurant to invest more in their food rather then the store front. Well thats if Im going for true style home cookin'. Coming from Atlanta and having eaten in DC, I knew that my standards were already set exceptionally high for Ethiopian food. Since it was 11:30, we went ahead and got the buffet. For someone who has never had Ethiopian before, this is a great way to sample different dishes to figure out what you like. For $9 there were 2 meat options (chicken and beef) and a variety of vegetarian options (cabbage, green beans) and of course your lentils. The really enjoyed the Injeera and inquired as to whether they make it  regularly in house. The owner told me that given the complexity, they make it often and store it but it is not made every day. It was still delicious. I also learned from our server/owner that ownership has recently changed but the menu has stayed the same. I believe she mentioned that the chef has changed too. Overall, the food was okay. I will have to come back another time to try their dishes off the menu rather then the buffet. I have no complaints whatsoever about the service. Our server was very nice and good about answering any questions we had. The restaurant was also very clean.",Gojo Ethiopian,6153320710,109 reviews,2014-06-20,"Nashville, TN",/biz/gojo-ethiopian-nashville,3.0,124,"Washington, DC",Kina L.

Delicious.  I ate the mixed plate which was super freaking fantastic for an indecisive person.   The only thing I did not like was the teemateem salad. I have had this at other Ethiopian places it is a simple salad comprised of teemateem (tomatoes), red onion, jalapeños, lemon juice and some ethiopian spices like berbere or mitmita.  Here it means generic Italian salad dressing  with tomatoes, onion and a sprinkle of something on top that I'm not familiar with. Otherwise the meal was great, the servers were super friendly and the tea which was perfectly spiced completed the meal.  Did I say add the cheese?

"415 W Thompson LnNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"We went here for my sister-in-laws birthday dinner. Service was lacking due to the server smaking her chewing gum while taking our order, neglecting to refill our drinks, clear any dishes from our table of 11 people, and taking 20 minutes to bring us to-go boxes. My 10yr old daughter won't eat anything spicy so the server said that Deqa Minchet Ages would be perfect. When my daughter tried it, she couldn't eat it because of its spiciness. I told the server this and asked if she could have something else and she obliged. We ordered the chicken curry and handed the original food back which the server refused to take.

"415 W Thompson LnNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"Great food! Friendly service, and great prices too. My group had some veteran Ethiopian food eaters and some rookies.

The lamb was awesome and the peas and lentil dishes were all very tasty. The enjera (flat bread that's a staple of Ethiopian) was great - warm, but not soggy or dried out like many places.Finally, we finished off with the coffee.

"415 W Thompson LnNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"Before I begin, I must say that I never give a lunch buffet a score higher than 3 stars.

That said,m the lentil dish here was not bad. Not great, but not bad. THe collard dish was tasty and the beans were lao not bad.The heart of any Ethiopian  restaurant is Injera. Good Injera goes a long way, and Gojo has really good Injera. Draping the dishes with Injera served to bring out the flavor in a yummy way.As I said, 3 is as high as lunch buffets get.

"415 W Thompson LnNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"The website advertises their Ethiopian coffees, teas, as well as espresso. Don't be fooled, if you would like to stop in here to sample some of those and some appetizers, you are not welcome here. Came here with 2 other friends who are very involved in the community for a brief meeting. My friends and I tend to prefer to patronize local locations for things like this, rather than leaving the neighborhood to hand my money over to a corporate chain. I often talk up places like this around the community to support local business. Since we all work with internationals full time and enjoy Ethiopian coffee and tea (one of the main draws for an Ethiopian restaurant in my opinion) we came here at 7 on a Friday night, ordered teas, coffee and two plates of sambusa. There was no wait, and plenty of empty tables, meaning if we hadn't been there, the table would have been empty. After spending quite awhile discussing matters, one of my friends got up to pay and was informed by the waitress that ""We don't usually serve for just coffee and tea"" (Nevermind the two plates of appetizer we bought and paid for). She said it was ""Okay this time, but so we would know in the future."" Rest assured, in the future, I won't be coming here, and will encourage my contacts in the community to avoid rather than patronize this establishment. I have eaten here a couple of times before, the food is really not bad, but not as good as some of the other restaurants in town, and there are definitely better, friendlier options for Ethiopian in town.",Gojo Ethiopian,6153320710,93 reviews,2012-09-16,"Knoxville, TN",/biz/gojo-ethiopian-nashville,1.0,124,"Washington, DC",Laura B.

I thought the beef dish was bland and dry by comparison.  Several of the veggie dishes were also excellent, especially the chickpeas.  I'll also echo the previous reviews on the cheese appetizer, it's amazing and not be missed.  Service was friendly, but the food did take a long time to arrive.",Gojo Ethiopian,6153320710,11 reviews,2014-07-28,"Nashville, TN",/biz/gojo-ethiopian-nashville,4.0,124,"Washington, DC",Brent E.

"415 W Thompson LnNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"This is the best Ethiopian food in Nashville.  We've eaten at several others and they all have their pluses and minuses, but this one has the best food. Try the spicy beef and the lamb for meats.  The lamb is mild but flavorful - they have a couple of types of beef - one spicy, the other not as much.  Order a sampler and you can combine beef choices together with vegetarian choices with injera (spongy Ethiopian bread used as a utensil).  The building sits alone, right on the street and is nicer inside than outside, with plenty of parking.  Service was pleasant and not fast, but paced for an enjoyable dinner.  Try their coffee - they roast the beans on order, come and show you the smoking beans, then grind and serve in a traditional vessel with a side of incense - a great way to end your meal with one of Ethiopia's greatest crops.  Definitely worth a visit. They also have a large separate dining room, which could probably be reserved for a fun private party.",Gojo Ethiopian,6153320710,6 reviews,2014-10-14,"Franklin, TN",/biz/gojo-ethiopian-nashville,5.0,124,"Washington, DC",TJ F.
"415 W Thompson LnNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"I jumped in the car with my friend who is also my boss, colleague, and mentor for the last 20 years. He declares, ""Trust me! I am picking the lunch location today."" Uh oh.We pulled into Gojo and I was bummed. I had my own declaration, ""I am not eating goat."" We walk in the door and my friend loads up a place from the buffet with rolled up something or another and tells me to help myself to the buffet. Ok. Whatever. I don't eat goat.The buffet of mixed greens, onions, tomatoes, and cucumbers with a rocking vinaigrette was very good. The next few dishes were vegetarian dishes with a prominent curry flavor: yellow lentils, red lentils, and potatoes in curry gravy. The meat dish was beef stew served next to a rice dish.The rolled up something or another was apparently our ""silverware"" and it appeared to me to be a flat sponge...what is it? The look on my face caused my friend to start laughing. I had no idea what the rolled up stuff was...it looked like skin. Really? It was cold, rolled up, and a very strange texture. Well, it turns out that it was spongey, buckwheat bread shaped like a tortilla. Shew! It wasn't goat. All the items were good and certainly nothing like Cracker Barrel. We finished the meal with a Coffee ceremony. Please, stop reading this review right now and head to Gojo just to have coffee. It was incredible. Once we ordered the table was cleaned up and they started roasting the beans in the kitchen. Once the beans were properly roasted they brought the beans out smoking hot in a wooden bowl allowing us to smell the freshly roasted beans. Soon, they are returning to the table with coffee cups, cream, and frankincense. The coffee is served in a ceramic Jebena which is easy to pour into small cups. The coffee was incredible.

I've never eaten Ethiopian before so I had no idea what to expect. Now I have had their coffee before so I started with that. BEWARE - their coffee is $8.00 a pot! I mean, it's good but not $8.00 a pot good. They don't have it listed on the menu and that's a pet peeve of mine. If I'm going out to eat then I can afford it regardless but I don't want to ask and sound like a cheap skate. Moving on, I ordered the awaze tibs and my friend ordered lamb. We were asked if we wanted to eat family style on one serving tray so we could share and try both. Sure, why not! They do not give you silverware because you eat with your hands. I'm glad that I read a few reviews before going there because I wouldn't have known that (thanks yelpers)! They give you a spongey, pancakey bread to rip up and scoop the food in. I can definitely dig it :) Our server was very sweet and was nice about making suggestions. Oh and if you do order the coffee, know that it's about a 20 minute wait. I'm not complaining!

"415 W Thompson LnNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"Of all the Ethiopian restaurants that have existed at this location, Gojo is my favorite.  Gojo is, I believe, the third one in 10 years.  Actually went there a few times without realizing it had changed from Adis ABai (I believe the name was) to Gojo.I've been there with roughly 16 people since it's been Gojo, of them one hated the place with a fury passion based on the meat.  It was a non-stop complain-fest from someone who normally does not complain that much.  That aside, it's always been roughly the same positive comments.For those who have never been, go in and order a wat (or hit the buffet).  I always get the vegetarian wat, but there are plenty of options for meat eaters.You'll use the spongy bread (and additional bread they give you) to scoop your food up.  If you need silverware, you're doing it wrong.Service is generally pretty friendly, wait times vary, the parking for the place people seem to think they're going to get stabbed or robbed in at night, so if you're worried hit it at lunch but I will warn you, I've never escaped this place without a carbo-coma.  You will want a nap afterward.The decor is... um... not a place to bring a date or try to impress someone at.  It's a hole in the wall, and the holes it has in the wall are filled by window unit air conditioners.No idea the authenticness of this place, it could be completely unauthentic, but it's tasty",Gojo Ethiopian,6153320710,573 reviews,2010-10-25,"Nashville, TN",/biz/gojo-ethiopian-nashville,4.0,124,"Washington, DC",Paul K.
"415 W Thompson LnNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"This was my first experience with Ethiopian food and dining practices. The food was great, and was served on top of, and with, injera bread. The bread is a spongy, moist sourdough that resembles a cross between a thick crepe and a crumpet. I ordered unsweetened tea, and discovered that their tea is flavored with cloves. The waitress was nice and helpful, but we ordered from the menu, and the prep time for our food, or service of any kind, was glacial. This might explain why all the other customers ate from the buffet. Our appetizer was four small, triangular pastries filled with seasoned ground beef and jalapeños. These were quite tasty, but small enough to fulfill the definition of appetizer. In most restaurants, after I have finished the appetizer, I am no longer really hungry. The lunch was followed by an espresso that was excellent. The decor and dining accouterments were low key and minimalist (you essentially eat with your hands.) A couple of postprandial hot, moist towels would have been a nice, and much needed, touch. I will probably return and try the buffet, in order to get a wider selection of foods.",Gojo Ethiopian,6153320710,17 reviews,2014-06-20,"Fairview, TN",/biz/gojo-ethiopian-nashville,4.0,124,"Washington, DC",Richard G.

"415 W Thompson LnNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"I've been looking forward to eating at Gojo for months. Finally made it tonight. Good meal, great service and real dive-y feel (mostly in a good way). We started with all three appetizers and the lentil salad. The first app was goat (I think) cheese with collard greens on a piece of baguette. Delicious. The next two were fried pocket things - one with beef the other with lentils. Both were great. We ordered three entrees; beef tips, lamb and the chicken drum sticks one (sorry I don't recall the names of the dish).  The beef and lamb dishes had stewed cubes of meat that were tough. The chicken fell off the bone and was the one I'll order next time.

"415 W Thompson LnNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"Delicious food and cozy atmosphere.Gojo is located on Thompson lane almost across the street from Krispy Kreme.  I visited one rainy, cold night and found the restaurant pleasantly busy and warm.  As a point of disclosure, I am not well versed in Ethiopian cuisine, but I found the food here delicious.  Dishes are served in a typical Ethiopain style - family style on injera which is used to scoop the food in leiu of silverware.   They have various meat and vegetarian dishes from which to choose.  The food was not overly spicy, but well seasoned.  They do not have a liquor license, but you can bring your own alcohol or go next door to the bar and purchase drinks 'to go'.  It is a great place for a couple or medium sized group to enjoy dinner.   It has inspired me to learn more about Ethiopian cuisine!",Gojo Ethiopian,6153320710,47 reviews,2012-01-08,"Nashville, TN",/biz/gojo-ethiopian-nashville,4.0,124,"Washington, DC",B L.
"415 W Thompson LnNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"4.5 stars rounding up. I admit that I am not an expert by any means of Ethiopian (I have tried exactly two Ethiopian restaurants ), but I enjoy this restaurant immensely.  Nashville has a large Ethiopian and Somali community, and I think it shows in some great cuisine here. First a few notes; bring some friends along-this is a great communal meal and adds an extra family-style bonding to dinner.  Also, as the only utensils are your hands, be sure to wash before and after the meal-I don't want this place to close due to some fool going down with Salmonella.   The basic structure of the meal revolves around the Enjera/Injera, a sourdough-like slightly leavened flatbread, The unrolled bread is about 24 inches in diameter (but around 1/4 in thick) and is consumed by tearing off hunks and consuming by hand. Various salads, stews and vegetable pastes are placed on top of the injera, and may be picked up with the torn flatbread pieces.All orders are brought together and placed on a single injera slab, and extra rolls of injera are placed besides us to starting the picking process. This initiates a free-for-all as everyone begins picking and eating. Gojo makes great vegetable dishes, including the delicious mildly spicy lentil paste Miser W'et, slightly sour split pea paste Kik Aletcha, a chickpea dish Shiro W'et, and Tikle Gomen, an absolutely delicious garlicky curry cabbage. These legume-heavy, mild pastes contrast well with the slight sourness of the injera, and induced some child-like obsession with dipping among yours truly.     Gojo also makes great lamb dishes.  The Yebeg T'ibs, sauteed lamb chunks with onions and spices including rosemary, differed completely from Yebeg Alicha, a mushy curried lamb, contributing a thick meat-and-potatoes taste and the more subtle pulled pork-like spiced shredded meat taste to the meal; both were quickly consumed.   Some Ethiopian tea was ordered as well.  It is quite strong stuff, and has some additional hint of sweetness. The only menu item that did not particularly thrill me was the Doro w'et; at the other Ethiopian restaurant I have tried, the chicken was shredded and immersed in an immensely spicy sauce; here, it was two chicken legs sorely lacking piquancy, which made for some difficulty in both kick and ease in consuming the meal communally. All meat dishes were around $10 each, while vegetable dishes were around $8 each, though two meat and two vegetable dishes may be purchased for $12.50 while four (or five depending on the mood of the chef) vegetable dishes may be purchased for $10.50. Pooled together, it created an almost hors d'œuvre-like sample plate, allowing us to try some seven different meals, for about $30 total. Though thin, the bread is quite filling, and you will be satisfied by the end.The restaurant staff were quite prompt, as well as patient and friendly, pointing out and explaining interesting dishes. Furthermore, as the rolled injeras were consumed, a nice old lady that I assume to be the proprietor or cook walked around with a skillet, replacing the baskets with freshly made bread. Finally, as the food items above disappeared, we tore the bottom injera-now soaked with sauces- to pieces and consumed it with relish. Gojo is located on a strange corner of Thompson Lane and was fairly difficult to find. The parking lot was also somewhat small with no marked parking dividers.  I have no other complaints otherwise.I have taken some five different people in three different trips, and all liked the place and agreed that it was absolutely delicious and would return.

"415 W Thompson LnNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"When I crave Ethiopian food, it is without warning but with the utmost urgency. After 9 hours of babysitting yesterday, I found myself (once again) calling in a takeout order to Gojo.A mostly vegetarian, I stuck to my standard: the vegetarian sampler with numbers 16-19. Do I remember the names of the foods those numbers correspond to? Hell no. Just trust me, those are the best ones. The all time winner is Shiro Wet. I remembered that name, at least. That's my favorite.I love Gojo. It's full of great memories, like that time I showed up with a new boyfriend and was seated directly next my previous boyfriend. (Did I mention it's BYOB? This is very convenient for those life moments that almost demand you drink an entire bottle of Cabernet...) I also chose to have my birthday dinner here. Another time, I inadvertently ate my injera into a map of the northern hemisphere. Really. It was incredible. I love the food, and the cute down-to-earth feel of the place. Here's the the thing, though: during the aforementioned birthday dinner and boyfriend/ex-boyfriend nights, the service was sooooo slow. One time it was more than 30 minutes before our order was taken. And the next time we waited forever for our bill, ultimately having to hunt someone down and ask. I want this place to succeed, so I'm hoping this improves. For now, eating their lunch buffet, getting takeout (which is ready lightening fast! Ten to fifteen minutes, tops) or just approaching your sit-down dinner with a little patience seem like good workarounds.",Gojo Ethiopian,6153320710,10 reviews,2011-06-22,"Nashville, TN",/biz/gojo-ethiopian-nashville,4.0,124,"Washington, DC",Kate K.

"415 W Thompson LnNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"As soon as you walk in you're surrounded with the unique smell of Ethiopian food...  If you're unfortunate enough to have a wait, the smell is going to drive you nuts.  The menu is probably all food you've never heard of before unless you're very familiar with Ethiopian food, but the descriptions give you a pretty good idea of what everything is.  Everything we tried was good, especially the beef stew and the lentils.  The 4-way combo lets you choose 2 meat dishes and 2 veggie dishes and is served on injera...  Injera is an Ethiopian flatbread that is kind of like a giant brown pancake, but you use the injera to pick up the food and eat it instead of using utensils.  You also get an extra basket of rolled up injera on the side.  It's not really that great by itself, but when combined with the Ethiopian food it's stellar.  They don't serve alcohol, feel free to BYOB.  They didn't give us glasses or anything, so if you are bringing wine you may want to bring your own... otherwise you'll be eating with your hands and drinking straight from the bottle, which actually sounds like a lot of fun in retrospect.",Gojo Ethiopian,6153320710,182 reviews,2011-01-11,"Austin, TX",/biz/gojo-ethiopian-nashville,4.0,124,"Washington, DC",Stu R.

The food doesn't get rushed to the table, but when it does arrive, it comes with amazing, delicate flavors.

By all means, go for the ceremonial coffee if you have time. The coffee beans are roasted to order, and the beans are brought to the table once they are roasted so the guests can inhale the aroma.

Food is served family style (use the bread as your utensil) so I got to sample pretty much the entire menu. My favorites was the salad that is basically tomatoes and a light dressing, the number 2 appetizer its a beef wrap thing, and the lamb dish, pulled beef dish, and the ground beef and rice dish.

Never judge a book by it's cover. The inside was very nice and cozy. The (one) server running the whole place was very nice and helpful. The menus were easy to read, all items were translated to english. There were no drinks on the menu which I found odd, so we just got sodas. I found the food to be reminiscent of Indian food. We ordered a sort of spinach and hummus appetizer on toasted italian bread which was very tasty, and only $5. For entrees we ordered a lamb curry mix and chickpeas in a red oil sauce. If you've never had Ethiopian, you don't use utensils. all the food is served with mashed beans and corn on a large platter on top of a spongy, pancakey Ethiopian bread called injera that you use to sop up all the food. There is also some served on the side, but use as much of the center bread you can to get all the flavors of the food. We left very happy and full, and only spent about $30.

"4225 Nolensville PikeNashville, TN 37211",4.5,"This location is within the K & S World Market parking lot.This food truck provides the best Mexican food in greater Nashville area. When I moved here from soCal 3 years ago, I constantly craved quality Mexican food that was plentiful back home. My two Mexican classmates (one from East LA and other from Fullerton) and I spent so much time and money looking for decent Mexican food in Nashville.After 6-8 months, we gave up on actual restaurant establishments throughout Nashville. They all catered to non-Hispanic clientele, substituted quality by slabbing beans and/or cheese, or were regularly devoid of customers overall (for good reason). Instead, the three of us tried EVERY Mexican food truck that we came across over the last three years. We were very religious about this. If one of us spot a Mexican food truck, we'd take note of the intersection and made sure we'd try it before the end of the week. I've eaten well over a dozen or two Mexican food trucks in Nashville over the years. One truck(s) came out consistently on top: Taqueria Express. I have two soCal Mexican friends to back that up (one of them surprisingly cooks very well).Even if several of these trucks populate the same block or two on Nolensville, Taqueria Express always had considerably more Hispanic customers. Even while waiting for my order, at least two or three cars would drive up, park, and place orders. This does not happen at other Mexican food trucks and I don't blame them: they're not as good as Taqueria Express.I'll be honest in stating that I've been disappointed by the rave reviews that a number of Mexican restaurant establishments have received on Yelp. That's why when it comes to ethnic foods in Nashville, I trust the crowding of ethnic customers more so than high scores on Yelp (ie Seoul Garden). Taqueria Express is another great example.Don't get me wrong, a few other Mexican food trucks will provide an item or two that will top Taqueria Express. Some tacos will be better found elsewhere, depending on your personal preference on the ratio and balance of various ingredients. But as a whole, the meats are more flavorful, more juicy, and remind me of the food I've eaten within 1 hour from the Mexican border.My personal favorite meats at Taqueria Express, in this exact order: 1 pollo (chicken), 2 pastor (spicy pork), and 3 beef (carne asada). I personally like the quesadillas, mulitas, sopes, and burritos.This is where my confusion lies. There are a small number of food trucks in Nashville called ""Taqueria Express"". With my limited Spanish (and their limited English), the employees have stated that these ""Taqueria Express"" trucks are from the same company. I'm not sure if they're all owned by one person who licenses out these trucks, if they're distributed as a franchise, or are jointly operated by the Mexican Mafia. If you look at the city licenses taped on each of these trucks, they're all registered with a slightly different name, address, or person. Yet the menu items are identical, the menu pictures are identical, the prices are similar, and if you ask the people who work there, they say they share the same recipes and ownership.I've asked each truck how many trucks are under the ""Taqueria Express"" company (my classmates have asked them in Spanish as well). Each truck has given a different number, whether it's 5, 6, 7, or 8, all in the greater Nashville area. My classmates and I have located, pinpointed, and eaten at exactly four of these Taqueria Express trucks. We have searched high and low for the remaining 1, 2, 3, or 4 trucks (your guess is good as mine). I'll post reviews of the three remaining Taqueria Express trucks (that I've found) on Yelp as well... I hope the Yelp gods and goddesses don't mind me copying and pasting since their food items are almost identical. ;-)I'm so happy to post this review--now I can finally check-in at Taqueria Express several times per week. I love the chicken quesadilla. Be warned though: a number of the non-English speaking customers will hand you their odd business cards for who knows what. I've collected a stack of business cards from other Mexican customers over the last 3 years. I have no idea what these businesses do. I don't speak enough Spanish and they don't speak enough English to explain to me what that's all about.",Taqueria Express,,116 reviews,2011-07-12,"Houston, TX",/biz/taqueria-express-nashville-4,5.0,10,"Washington, DC",Tin N.

Their rice and beans are decent, but you don't need to order the asada or pollo plates to get rice and beans; you can order a la cart, say, 3 tacos and rice and beans.Prices are quite reasonable, but the young lady handling the register speaks no English and doesn't know how to count, and her mistakes are always in her favor.

Two weeks ago I ordered a salad and the app buffalo chicken (my downfall after drinking) - the salad was ""fine,"" I guess as far as salads go, although everything on it was clearly from a can :/The buffalo things we obviously frozen out of a bag, fried/kinda but not enough for the chicken to really cook to the right texture-- then again it's from the frozen isle. The price point doesn't make sense on that, nor does dabbing a dot of COLD buffalo sauce on each ""tender"" classify as something that's either visually, or tastefully, appealing.

While on vacay in Nashville our taxi driver after a night out recommended this place for late night eats. We ventured into Little Chicago to discover a poorly decorated and empty restaurant. I ordered a personal size traditional crust pizza with black olives and mozzarella sticks. The other girls in my group also ordered personal size pizzas. We took our orders to go. We arrived to our hotel room across the street and quickly realized the pizza tasted like cardboard that they tried to cover up with cheap sauce out of a can and a semi decent mozzarella.

"1524 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"I was exhausted after our second day in Nashville and a late night at the Opry so I talked my husband into just going back to the hotel and ordering pizza. I seriously researched this decision. Tried to use GrubHub to find places that deliver, realized it wasn't all that useful so I started comparing pics on Yelp because all of the pizza places had mixed reviews. I've not had a Chicago style dip dish like this before with the sauce on top so I thought I'd give it a try.I ordered the Deep Dish Signature with italian sausage, pepperoni, and onions (minus mushrooms for us). It was only $26 for a large plus tax and delivery. I thought that was pretty reasonable considering how loaded this pizza was. My husband was a little surprised by the weight of the pizza when he took it from the delivery guy.They estimated an hour delivery time and it arrived in 45 minutes.Overall I thought the pizza was very good. Plenty of gooey cheese, sweet and flavorful sauce, crust wasn't soggy and really held up to the thick layers atop it.My one complaint was a strangely sweet flavor I tasted in the crust that I just couldn't put my finger on. It almost tasted like a cinnamon roll. I'm not sure if this was intentional or not but after a few bites it became unpleasant which meant I wasn't eating the outer crust....my favorite part! I don't know, maybe it was a fluke which is why I still give it 4 stars.Another note: I did appreciate that there was foil underneath the pizza, not only does it keep the crust from tasting like stale cardboard it was quite useful to wrap up the last two pieces to fit in our mini fridge.",Little Chicago,6153218660,333 reviews,2014-06-29,"Birmingham, AL",/biz/little-chicago-nashville,4.0,66,"Washington, DC",Ashley M.

Despite the horrible review, there were a few okay reviews, so I decided to give it a shot. BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER.Let's begin with the crust.. It is absolutely disgusting! The crust is chewy and flimsy. Deep dish pizza is supposed to have a flaky, buttery crust, and this crust is everything but that! It's like you're chewing on rubber. It's so rubbery that you can't even cut through it.I ordered delivery. They ran out of spinach, so I just ordered a cheese pizza with extra cheese.  When I cut into the pizza, I noticed that the cheese was not completely melted, and it was actually cold. This is the final straw for me! At this point I can't even eat the pizza, and I just want a refund. I called and spoke with Lauren, who had to get her manager's approval.

"1524 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Yikes is all I can say really... Although I read the reviews before we went, there were not many options here in Nashville so late. We chose to confide in the better reviews and keep our fingers crossed for a good experience. We must of not had our fingers crossed tight enough. We had already paid to park, so we walk in and while there were many customers, there was no one working to be found. A good 15 minutes later a guy finally comes running in. He seemed to be there alone. We gave him our drink order... Another good 15 minutes pass and he finally returns, without our drinks, to take our order. Again, we order our drinks, a calamari appetizer, and attempted to test our luck at a Chicago Deep Dish. (We are in Nashville temporarily....FROM Chicago...so big shoes to fill on the pizza.) He tells us they're not doing deep dish right now and left us with the option of a hand-tossed or thin crust. I asked if they cooked in a brick oven or how? He said they did cook in a brick oven, so we chose the thin crust. (Anyone from Chicago can vouch that besides Chicago's awesome deep dish, a crisp thin crust hot out of the brick oven is soooo tasty as well). He finally brings out the drinks and the calamari. The drinks were in bottles, since he said his machine was out(?). The calamari tasted like it has been over fried in old grease. My husband goes to add MORE money to the meter and then FINALLY the pizza comes... It's NOT a thin crust, it's a small hand-tossed and was SOPPING in juice. He ran off before we could say anything....and with him being no where to be found, we were starving and decided to eat it anyway. The crust was soggy and absolutely nasty. The topping was ok, but it was hard to pay attention to the flavor because of the soaking crust. By the time he finally came back around he said, ""Oh I was going to ask you how it was, but I can see you have it almost eaten so it must be great!"" I showed him how it was soggy, but we ate it because we were starving. He asked if he could bring us something else.... Considering we had already put money in the meter twice, waited so long, and the food turned out like this, we denied. ------ Not even a discount!! 2 bottle cokes, an over fried calamari appetizer, a small hand-tossed pizza soaking in tomato juice (from fresh tomatoes that he put on top...grr) --- $28 bucks! This is far from being even CLOSE to Chicago Pizza.... Not the atmosphere, not the quality, SURELY NOT the quantity.... You pay for what you get in Chicago Pizza.....which is a mouth full of AWESOME.

"1524 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"RAW, UNCOOKED RIBEYE STEAK!  On 11/24/13, I was working late at my office, and ordered dinner through GrubHub.  I ordered a ribeye steak cooked medium-rare, which included a side salad.  It was delivered just as i was headed home--looking forward to getting home and enjoying my steak.  Well, the inside of the steak was still RAW -- not even cooked.  It was as if they had lightly seared the outside and then taken it off the grill and delivered it.  Cold, raw, and dangerous.  I had to find something else to eat, and in the morning I reported the issue to GrubHub.  They informed me that the manager of Little Chicago in Nashville was unwilling to offer any kind of refund. The previous time I ordered, they got my order wrong, but I was able to eat it.  This time, delivering me a raw steak and then refusing to do anything about it is absolutely unacceptable.  I will not be patronizing the restaurant again, especially since I have no idea if the meal ordered will be safe and edible...but also because of the horrible service.",Little Chicago,6153218660,1 review,2013-12-05,"Nashville, TN",/biz/little-chicago-nashville,1.0,66,"Washington, DC",Ed N.

Nobody else was in there, so we sat where we wanted. Our server was a pleasant, energetic guy who promptly served us Yazoo beer and advised us on his favorite deep dish variation. I had never had a true deep dish pizza before, so I was excited to try it! We ordered the Ultimate Meat pizza and waited as patiently as we could while they baked it. My jaw dropped when our server brought it out to us-- it looked like something I had needed all my life. It was glorious. Gooey cheese, meat everywhere, and it had to be sliced like cake!

"1524 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Little Chicago has, without a doubt, the worst food and service in Nashville. We walked in a 8 o'clock and there wasn't a single customer inside, and we were greeted from afar by are waitress who told us to sit anywhere. She took our drink order, and came back a minute later after walking outside to take our food before bringing us our drinks, I'm assuming to save herself a trip. This was the last we saw of her while we waited 45 minutes for our food.I was expecting a quick bite to eat, based on my other experiences at other area Greek restaurants such as Athens and King Solomon (which is drive up but oh so good). So, the 45 minute wait felt unwarranted. Our waitress could have at least come by and said out food was on the way...she only had one other table.I ordered ""herb roasted chicken"" expecting a roasted chicken breast, leg, or half chicken. Instead, I got chicken breast chopped up and sautéed with peppers and onions served over pita bread. It was essentially chicken fajita filling. It was dry, flavorless, and the portion was small. It came with a side salad, which tasted unwashed and bitter, and fruit cup that consisted of a couple spoonfuls from a Dole fruit cocktail jar (not kidding, it even had the pool of syrup at the bottomof the cup) Even the pita bread was awful; it was hard and stale.My fiancée ordered a chicken salad that was missing some of the ingredients listed in the menu and she complained of bitterness in the dressing and lack of chicken. It was also small and served on a shallow dinner plate.The real kicker was when the check came. Our total was $26 with water to drink. That pricing is outrageous for what we got. My ""herb"" chicken was $12.99 and the salad was $10.99. I would have gladly paid those prices if I got anything remotely resembling what we ordered.This was one of those dining experience that was so bad, it wasn't worth complaining about because you don't want them to bring you something else...you just suck it up and get out of there, never to return.When we left, the couple sitting outside was starring at their plates and one of them said ""I'm more hungry now than I was when we got here"" We felt the same way...so we went to Wendy's to get a strawberry frosty parfait to drown the bad taste Little Chicago left in our mouth.Avoid at all cost.",Little Chicago,6153218660,20 reviews,2012-06-27,"Nashville, TN",/biz/little-chicago-nashville,1.0,66,"Washington, DC",Sean S.

"5849 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"My world travels have taken me to many places and I harbor fond memories of many of the people I met and the food we shared. Sometimes on those trips, including my year in Southeast Asia, I stepped off the beaten path. Once in a while in Nashville I encounter similar situations.In a broad sense Miss Saigon kinda fits the category of ""slightly"" off the path. Look among the shops and businesses that line Charlotte Pike and you will find Miss Saigon noticeably missing at the curbside address listed for it. That's because the restaurant is nearly secluded, off the street, sitting on a hill, in a small mall serviced by an unnamed driveway. But, persist in your search (or call the owner for directions) and you will find the end is well worth the effort.Enter a warm, warmly-lit, comfortable environment on a warm evening. Did I saw warm? Yes, I did, and that is my only complaint--the atmosphere was warm and humid both inside and out.But let's get closer to the essence of this culinary trek. Gōi Cuôn (Vietnamese Spring Roll, Summer Roll, or Salad Roll): tightly rolled rice-paper wrapped rice-vermicelli and vegetable rolls that begged for the accompanying peanut sauce. The sauce was sweet and just the right thickness to cling to every bite and bring home the flavors of the stuffing. And the peanut nuggets topping the sauce added an additional texture to the dish. I ordered the tofu version, but plain veggie, pork, and shrimp are also available. Score one for starters.Next, I ordered the Bánh Mì Thit Nurong (A Vietnamese version of a Po' Boy with BBQ pork.) This submarine-style sandwich with pork, cucumber, cilantro, and jalapeño is served on a crusty French Roll with chewy dough interior. The pork was sweet and tender and most likely basted with honey, lemongrass, fish sauce, and sesame oil. While it was very flavorful, the meat in the sandwich was a little skimpy for such a large bun. Missing in action--the traditional mix of pickled carrot and daikon that normally garnishes the sandwich. I thought it a bit a bit odd to list a full sandwich as an appetizer. My take: solid flavors as far as they went but underwhelming overall.Go Phō or go home? Home can wait...I'm staying for a large steaming bowl of Phō Tái, a delicately flavored beef broth covering oodles of rice-vermicelli noodles. The broth had hints of ginger, green onion, and other seasonings. Accompanying the bowl was the traditional plate of savory and spicy Thai Basil, Mint, plus additional fresh, green herbs and raw bean sprouts and Jalapeño slices to add as you like. The soup was topped with very thin slices of rare beef which simmered to tender perfection in the hot broth right at the table. Wow! It was the hit of the night.My dining friends (9 in all) were unanimously pleased with every one of their entrees--all different.The clincher: We could not have asked for a more congenial, polite, and attentive staff....from beginning to end. Their ""southern hospitality"" and friendliness earned them high praise from me and from my dining companions. By the way...Unsure how to pronounce the Vietnamese names?

"5849 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"I cannot believe it took me so long to come to Miss Saigon! What is funny is that I actually come to the Asian Market (K&S) on a regular basis to buy fresh fish. I've obviously seen their sign before. Well, for lunch today, my friend insisted we went outside of the usual Farmer's Market choices. We drove out to Charlotte Pike to visit this Vietnamese Heaven. We walked in at around 1:30 and were seated immediately. My friend ordered a Sprite and fried rice. I ordered their pho. Nashville has SUCH a pho drought that whenever I find a new place that sells pho, my heart is filled with hope. This time, it was for good reason too. They had raw beef slices with pho for only $7.95. While this is not the same as cheap California pho, it's also not bad at all for Nashville. My serving was HUGE and, while delicious, I'll be finishing it tomorrow afternoon for lunch. There was lots of beef, soup and noodles in my pho. I wish there were some more spice options but I guess I could have asked and did not. Overall, great first experience. They have lots of little things on the menu that I would love to try.

You could not smell the spice in the broth and it just tasted salty, no flavor at all. I had to add almost a quarter of the hoisen sauce bottle just to add more flavor to it.

"5849 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"I was so happy and surprised to find a decent Vietnamese restaurant in Nashville! I had their bun bo hue (Vietnamese spicy beef udon) and ra ma (pennywort drink).Bun bo hue is one of the most underrated Vietnamese dishes as well as my favorite dish! It was actually delicious here, but it did miss some pork blood and needed a splash of fish sauce in it. Overall, it was good and if you have had it yet- the flavor might be a little overwhelming. It's purely a meat broth.Ra ma was slightly too sweet so I had to add more water to it (problem solved).My friend ordered the pho dac biet. The broth tasted a little off even after we put a bunch of other seasoning in it.

Sometimes their service is a little wonky, but the food is as close as it comes to making us feel like we are back in Denver. Everyone raves about the Pho and it is amazing here, but try the #41 Vietnamese rice noodle bowl with pork and pork egg roll because that's where it's at folks. Don't be afraid of the fish sauce either, pour all of that goodness into the bowl and mix it up. They sell Tiger Beer here which is one of our favorites so grab one of those while you are at it! They also accept cards which i've found to be an issue at some of the other restaurants here.

"5849 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"Miss Saigon is fancier than its neighbors VN Deli and Kian Giang. The dining room is nicely decorated in what in my naïve mind are authentic Vietnamese decorations. It was 12:30pm on a Thursday when I visited and the place was busy but not packed. I was seen right to my seat.I ordered my standard spring roll and a bowl of pho. I went with the shrimp and pork spring rolls. They were very tasty and fresh. My pho arrived and I had to dig in and taste the broth. Wow! It was rich and balanced.  It came with the plate of garnishes; basil, bean sprouts and jalapeño.There were a few little issues that I didn't feel added up to taking a star, especially with that soup! They appear to only have one size, large. (Though at 7.95 very fairly priced.) This is silly but most of the pho places have the hoisin and sriracha in unlabeled squirt bottles. I have this idea of a worker coming in every morning to make a fresh batch of each and fill the bottles. This illusion is smashed by a bottle of Lee Kum Kee hoisin on the table. I told you it was silly.There is something about Kian Gang (which is literally across the parking lot from Miss Saigon) that I love, but I would rather have the pho at Miss Saigon.

It came with sauce on the side that I have no idea what it was, but it was great! I was very happy with what I got and it came out in a timely manner and was hot. It was also a lot of food for $8. The other people at my table got soups and they said theirs were delicious. My only gripe was the service. Once our food came out they never checked on us again.

"5849 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"I have been here twice in the past 6-8 months and both times loved it. The last trip we ordered the quail for an appetizer. It was two small pieces that three of us shared. It came with a sauce that surprised me when I tasted it - very lemony and peppery. The quail was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside - delicious.I ordered a beef soup (not pho) and my companions ordered dishes I hadn't tried. Everything was flavorful and there's plenty of it. I love the sides of cilantro, peppers and sprouts to add to the dishes.We tried a dessert that I had never had. I don't know what it was called, but it was a coconut that had been cooked w/ custard and some kind of gelatin in it. The coconut meat was soft enough to spoon out and the custard was great, but the gelatin I mostly picked around. The one disappointing thing is that they have a beer menu, but when we ordered our server told us they didn't have their license.

"5849 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"We found ourselves at Miss Saigon not because we planned it but rather because our go-to Vn Pho Deli, down the hill on the other side of Charlotte was packed--people were sitting on the sidewalk waiting for a table and we were not in the mood to camp. We'd just come from Nashville Comi Con and needed sustenance and I needed a spicy head clearing that Vietnamese soups deliver to me in spades--Fall allergies to ragweed were killing me. Poor Miss Saigon. A large space with very few patrons.  She's a shabby girl. Some of the booth seats were torn and neglected.  The staff have the demeanor of sullen, resentful children whose parents left them to mind the store.  Compare that to the snappy, attentive service at Vn Pho Deli or even the loopy but creepily charming attentions from the multilingual lady whom I call Salvatore at the other pho shop, Kien Giang, in the same plaza. The number of non-Asians dining here was notable. At VPD down the hill, the patrons seem to always be almost all Asian. That's usually my high water mark for any ethnic restaurant--locals looking for home cooking out. We had the egg noodle seafood soup with wontons, the vermicelli noodles with grilled pork, grilled pork chops with broken rice, and egg rolls. The highlight here is that I can get a bottle of beer with my meal. Excellent. Sapporo, Kirin, Michelob, and a couple of others. The egg noodle seafood soup. Not bad. Not great. Will do if you need a bowl and it won't completely piss you off. The wontons were heavy and doughy. Tells me they were frozen.  The broth was thin and salty and made my mouth raw. Not enough caramelized shallots that would have provided depth or mustard greens and chives to compliment the fatty meat. The sliced pork was cut with the grain and too chewy to manage. The fresh jalapeño almost hurt me it was so hot (loved that!). No pickled jalapeños available and this dish requires that. The pork chops with broken rice were pretty darned good. Texture and execution were almost perfect. Flavor was a bit sweet--not enough garlic or lemon grass. Pickled veggies (daikon and carrot) were a great counterpoint and lightly piquant. The vermicelli with pork was weirdly dry, the pork too sweet.  Overall meh.

"5849 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"Firstly, let me say that I am Vietnamese.  I was born in Saigon and moved to CA just before my 5th birthday.  My parents are more Vietnamese than you can possibly imagine and until college, I considered anything that didn't have nuoc mam (fish sauce) in it ""American food.""  Take my word for it when I tell you that Miss Saigon is the closest thing to real Vietnamese food in Nashville.  Now, if this restaurant was in CA or FL, this review would probably be more like 2.5 stars but compared to other nightmarish Asian restaurants in the Nashville area, Miss Saigon is the only one that I wouldn't be scared to take my parents to. Firstly, I say that this place is truly Vietnamese because the miracle of Tennessee miracles is that their pho actually tastes like pho!  Whoa, would you look at that!  Their pho is actually flavored with cinnamon, anise, corriander, fennel, cardamom, clove, and whole peppercorn instead of ground pepper!  You can tell that they cook these herbs whole in the broth instead of using ground powder.  It makes a HUGE difference.  Another amazing thing?  They include ngo gai as one the garnishes!  I don't know the English equivalent but it's the spiky green leaf-like herb that is a staple condiment of pho.  I've been to VN Pho & Deli, Kien Giang, Far East, and Vinh Long...NONE of them have ngo gai!  I was thoroughly impressed.  The only thing that I will say is that I really wish that they would give you more meat.  It's a pretty large bowl and it just looks sad with so little meat.The hu tieu here is A-OK.  The broth was good and I loved the fried garlic oil that came on top of the noodles.  I got pork & shrimp in my hu tieu and to my surprise, my bowl actually came with more shrimp than pork.  My only complaint is the noodles.  I understand that hu tieu is actually a Vietnamese interpretation of a Chinese dish, but I don't like the clear noodles.  I've always had hu tieu with freshly-dipped rice noodles similar to what you use in pho but this may just be a regional Saigon thing.  In all, Miss Saigon is pretty good Vietnamese food with flavors that are all very reminiscent of my childhood.  I do wish that they served some more Vietnamese staples instead of the usual pho, hu tieu, and thit nuong dishes but beggars can't be choosers so I'll take what I can get!",Miss Saigon,6153541351,66 reviews,2013-10-18,"Alexandria, VA",/biz/miss-saigon-nashville,4.0,122,"Washington, DC",Myan T.

In fact, a highly rated Vietnamese restaurant is in the same shopping complex, but they are cash only. Saigon is a nice restaurant; clean and spacious, and they offer beer and wine options. I looked over the menu and decided on the chicken soup with seafood. My waiter informed me they were out of crab meat, so I decided on the tofu and vegetables instead. He then told me they were out of chicken broth completely (there goes a good chunk of the menu). Sigh. So I reluctantly ordered the beef pho (not a big beef fan) with tofu and vegetables. It came out very quickly in a large bowl with bean sprouts, lime, and some plant relative of the basil on the side. It was pretty decent, but not the punch of flavor I typically expect from pho. I had to add quite a bit of chili sauce to get the right flavor. Overall, it was OK. Nothing horrible, but not amazing either.

I finally dined in last Saturday and the atmosphere was adorable there was a huge Vietnamese party going on.

"5849 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"The battle line has been drawn - Charlotte Pike. On this side, atop a little hillock, is all of Vietnam's most powerful weapons. And on the other side, actually everywhere below the hill, is the rest of the city.Miss Saigon. Boom! Kien Giang. Bam! Vn Pho. (sound of a sniper's rifle) There is no escape. The attack is relentless. Only a white napkin of surrender will end it. The Vietnamese restauranteers have formed an elite Sriracha squad and they have our taste-buds in sight, locked and loaded.I was tasked to infiltrate and come back with recon intelligence of Miss Saigon. The word was the chefs of this place were brewing a secret sauce - one part hot, one part spicy and every bit a hellish disco on your tongue. Also news was that the ravishing Italian actress, Vermicelli, was being held captive in the kitchen. They said, ""Hey man! You are from Asia, right?""""Technically, yes,"" I replied, giving my most dashing smile.""Then you are it.""""Ok!""""Here is a top secret watch.""""Oh cool. What does it do? Does it have like a parachute or something?""""No. It can tell time.""""Oh.""""And date.""""Hmm...""""And if you press this button...""""Yes...?""""A small light comes on.""""Neat. What is the point?""""It's late. What time do you have?""I looked at my new top secret watch. ""It says 8:30.""""You must hurry. They close by 9:30 and then it'll be too late. Vermicelli will be no more.""So I hopped into my sexy Honda Civic and zipped to Miss Saigon, careful to put on my turn lights and stopping at every stop sign. An aquarium greeted me. Suspicious looking fish swam in it. Was Vermicelli buried in there? Was she! GASP! sleeping with the fishes? A waiter beckoned me to a corner table. I had a clear shot of the kitchen. The air was heavy with chili sauce and something redolent.""What will you have?"" the waiter asked. I scanned the menu. Egg yolk in soda? WTF, man? ""Beer!""""And to eat?""I snapped my finger and asked the waiter to come closer. I looked around and whispered. ""I am on a mission.""""Like from San Francisco?""""No, idiot."" I said that too loud. A couple of patrons looked at me with suspicion. An old lady reached into her bag and retrieved a shotgun. I smiled. She smiled and put down the gun and picked up her chopsticks again. ""No,"" I whispered. ""I cannot eat meat. Get me something that doesn't have meat and still tastes good. Go!""The waiter ran off. I sank in my trench coat, put on my dark glasses and tipped my hat forward. I wanted to be anonymous. The waiter returned with my beer and announced merrily, ""Mr Alfred, your beer.""""HOW..."" I yelled and then quickly lowered my voice again. I grabbed his stupid tie and yanked him forward. ""How did you know my name?""""Your license, sir. I checked your id.""I let him go. Rookie mistake. Everyone has one every day. I asked for a straw and began enjoying my beer. Soon the waiter returned with a bowl. He placed it and said, ""Enjoy"" before running away into the kitchen. It was as if he had something to hide. The mystery deepened. I pressed the button on my watch. The light came on. 9:15PM. I had about 15 minutes to complete my mission. But first a man has to eat.I dug in. Memories of my mother suddenly exploded all over my head. Fragrant memories of me running along the beach, my dad climbing down a coconut tree, my servants frying curries under a thatch, my dad drinking beer through a straw, my aunts instructing the servants to add more lemongrass and spices, my servant feeding me with her own chopsticks, my servant choking me accidentally, my dad laughing at me, the spices mountaineering up my windpipe and then free-diving into my lungs, me crying, my mother crying, my dad crying with laughter...all memories exploded in that one spoonful of sauce at Miss Saigon. I began to cry.Afterwards, I wiped my face with a hanky and honked my nose. The old lady came up to me, placed the shotgun on the table and patted my head three times. ""There! There!"" she said and left.I called the waiter and hugged him. Like a mad Frenchman I kissed his cheeks and thanked him for the dish that reminded me of my childhood.""Are you crying because it was hot or because you are sad?"" he asked with a little bit of empathy.""Yes,"" I replied softly and left.Back at HQ, my commander demanded to know what happened to Vermicelli.""The Eye-talians are after me. What is the latest update?""""Sir,"" I said, standing up and placing my gun and badge on his table. ""She is not Italian anymore. She is a new person.

Little did I know that also means it included two shrimp and several small pieces of squid. It was clear from looking around at all of us that ordered pho that they made three bowls of broth and just threw meat in at the end and got confused about what went in which bowl. And, more importantly, didn't care it was wrong. The pho was decent. I've had better at several other places. Service was, honestly, terrible. Once our food arrived, the wait staff disappeared. I literally stared at the waiter and he just kept on walking. I had to ask for the check and then explain three times how we wanted it split.

"5849 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"I've always liked Miss Saigon. They were one of the first Vietnamese restaurants I'd ever been to and the food has always been spot on. Now they have remodeled and are chic and modern to top it off.The atmosphere is really nice compared to what you get at many other Vietnamese restaurants. I have had mixed service myself - sometime the people are great, sometimes almost rude - but if we factor in culture difference and just restaurants being restaurants in general I think it's all about the same.Food recommendations: Pho Tai Bo Vien; this is Vietnamese for first timers and sure to satisfy.Vietnamese Curry: If you like spicy or really wish you were at a Thai restaurant, this is the way to go. This red curry is bangin'; I've never had better. I suggest with tofu.Spring Rolls: Because you have to.Cafe Sura Da: See Spring Rolls.Pork Chop Plate: I have no idea what this is actually called, but it involved delicious pork chop, fresh steamed rice, and veggies served with nuoc mam, a mixed fish sauce for dressing. I don't particularly care for nuoc mam, myself, but know several folks who do so it's worth a try if you've never had it.Nashville has some excellent Vietnamese food.

"5849 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"So I know less than nothing about Vietnamese food.  I don't think I've ever even had it before.  But I was super hung over on Saturday and I thought ""that pho stuff everyone talks about seems that it would cure my hang over"" and so I ended up at Miss Saigon.The inside is nicer than expected, lots of booths and very quiet.  There was even a big screen with a football game on in the back of the room in case you really wanted to see whatever crap bowl game was on.  Our waiter brought the menu and he was less than overwhelmingly friendly and kind of looked at us like...um...yeah...right...you guys are lost.  Well, it was true b/c I had no idea exactly what to get.  I settled on the beef pho.  My friend got some curry dish.  And I got some spring rolls for no reason whatsoever.So the pho....I had no idea what to do with this exactly so I peeked at some other diners.  Oh so you pick up the noodles with the chopsticks and use the flat spoon to hold it up as well as get the broth.  I liked the broth very much but I liked it even more once I realized I could doctor up the heat with the chili sauce on the table and the peppers on the plate of accoutrements they provided.  It did take me a minute to realize that the stuff on that extra plate was meant to be put into the pho to fix it up, but once I did I was pleased.  Overall I left really full and warm and happy so it was pretty good.  2 weird things though: not a lot of beef in the pho and the menu said it was med rare but it wasn't....however, it was still tasty so whatever.  Of note, the curry was also pretty good even though I didn't think curry was a Vietnamese specialty.  Our waiter kept the drinks filled and said literally nothing else to us after the order.  I didn't dislike this though, I was too busy eating to answer how I am doing and all those niceties!Overall not bad.  Now I want to try Kien Giang too and maybe expand my knowledge of Vietnamese food.  Who wants to go with me?",Miss Saigon,6153541351,1027 reviews,2012-12-18,"Nashville, TN",/biz/miss-saigon-nashville,3.0,122,"Washington, DC",Nickie G.

Prices were a little higher than normal for Vietnamese restaurants, but for an extra couple bucks for the pho, you get a much nicer atmosphere and friendlier service than at Kien Giang.  Note: I didn't try the pho (I couldn't justify paying $10 for a bowl... not yet); it's just the standard by which I compare prices.  If you're new to Vietnamese food, I would definitely come here first.",Miss Saigon,6153541351,71 reviews,2012-12-15,"Nashville, TN",/biz/miss-saigon-nashville,4.0,122,"Washington, DC",Briana P.

"5849 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"Okay, so perhaps I have too high standards for Asian cuisine, but while this place is fair it is not quite on par with some of the better Vietnamese restaurants I have visited. Located deep in some ill-visited strip mall off of Charlotte Pike next to Lucky Bamboo, the place always feels quite empty.  The staff is well-meaning if not very responsive.  The menu is respectable, with all of the tried and true Vietnamese dishes with nothing particularly unique. The spring rolls, pork or shrimp wraps with herbs, lettuce, and chives in rice paper,  were definitely handmade and came off well in comparison to the dozens that I have tried over the years.  The pungent fish sauce is mediocre; not quite strong enough, and a bit too sweet. The House Specials were not particularly special; most of the vegetables and sauces look like they're from canned products, and the meat were not well sliced.  Other dishes were better. The Vermicelli was pretty good, meats and vegetables piled on top of rice pasta on a bed of shredded lettuce and served with fish sauce (Note: Vietnamese Vermicelli is a salad, not a pasta, as a co-worker's fiancee learned to her chagrin). The pho wasn't bad either, with all the proper trimmings of beef flank, shank, brisket, tendon and tripe. However the broth, while having the taste of beef, did not have that rich flavor that comes from brewing the soup with bone and star anise for hours on end.In general a meal cost around $10-15 dollars, reasonable but not especially cheap.  While not my favorite Vietnamese restaurant, it is respectable enough for me to visit when I'm in need of a pho fix.",Miss Saigon,6153541351,110 reviews,2011-07-13,"Nashville, TN",/biz/miss-saigon-nashville,3.0,122,"Washington, DC",Wayne H.

Anyway, I said to her ""where do you get Pho"" and she says ""Ah yes Pho, Miss Saigon!!!"" Well, I practically took her with me I was so excited. Pho is a rich beef based broth(it can be pork as well) that is poured over a hearty portion of noodles with veggies and chunks of beef included. Then along with your massive bowl of soup ( I suggest ordering a medium) comes a plate with lime, bean thread, fresh basil, and chili peppers for you to doctor your soup with. The final product is just out of this world. The Vietnamese spring rolls are also yummy, rice paper encasing shrimp, pork, and noodles with a mint peanut dipping sauce that my husband and I put chili oil in. Mmmmmmm.......

It is deliciously salty, rich, meaty and hearty with noodles that are soft and yielding yet with just the right amount of chew. It is cooked with care. The meat is of decent quality (yet a bit skimpy).The kicker: A decent meal at Miss Saigon costs well over $10. It's pho, not foie gras. A reasonable bowl of pho is five to MAYBE seven dollars. I understand that they need to pay their bills and cover the renovation, but one can not stand for such price-gougery in these harsh economic times. In any event, if you do try Miss Saigon, go for the adventurous items. Tripe, endon, springy mysery meatballs. These are the gems.

A lot of my vietnamese friends recommended that soup to me when I was living in OC, and it's a great pick! It's pretty different from the average pho bowl. The beef is different, there are different parts of meat, the soup is deliciously spicy, and the noodles are thicker, and it comes with shredded cabbage (at least i believe it to be cabbage) in addition to the usual bean sprouts that come on the side of soup. The atmosphere is definitely a fancier affair and the prices go along with it. I'd probably go to kien giang if i ever find myself in that center ever again. It's less expensive and it might be tastier than miss saigon which is more ambiance than it is cuisine.",Miss Saigon,6153541351,32 reviews,2009-09-13,"San Francisco, CA",/biz/miss-saigon-nashville,3.0,122,"Washington, DC",Veronica L.

The cold rice rolls are likewise very good. I have to admit that Kien Giang beats them on the pork with noodles front - the KG pork marinade is much much better, and the pieces are nice and thick, unlike Miss Saigon's thin small slices. Also, the shrimp they use in their noodle dishes are the tiny, horribly salty shrimp. AND... I was overcharged once as well, though I got the money back.But.

"2520 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"Food was good.  I ordered the death burger, or something of that name's nature.  It was supposed to be spicy I assume.  It had two small jalapeno slices on it, ha..  anyway it has a great flavor as I ordered it med well however the burger was so greasy it made the bun soggy :, (... this didn't stop me from enjoying, just would have been better less greasy.  Service was fairly prompt, our waiter seemed flustered, kept saying he'd  bring more tea 'brother' to the birthday boy at the table then would walk by again three or four minutes later saying the same thing.  Brought out two salads, only one was ordered then blamed it on the cooks.  No need to lay blame, offer it or brush it off and take it back.  Whatever.   And for gosh sake, let us eat in peace please.  I like my glass to stay full If I'm drinking, but I dont need to be bombarded after every sip.  Also, I'd like to be able to finish one story with who I am sharing a meal with :)There's customer service, then there is the overwhelming sense of ""Please Tip a Me!""

"2520 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"First I want to say that I am sharing this review with Tripadvisor and Virtual Tourist websites where I also leave reviews...Well I used to think this was the BEST steak house in Nashville area...but lately the past few visits have really been horrible...the latest was so bad that I don't think I will be going back.First of all, we were greeted immediately and they are so friendly in the front..but that is never the issue..The hostess seated us in the back room area near the windows..My daughter and I sat down, my husband had stopped in the restroom up front near the doors. We sat there a minute and I realized the table and seats that we were sitting in was covered in little very tiny pea ants...we got up immediately..the waitress near by asked us if there was a problem because we are both wiping our legs down...I said yes..this is covered with tiny ants...she said oh NO..and moved us to the next booth... I said NO ...I want to set far away from this area...she said But they have already marked you down for my section...I tried not to show my anger...""well please change it because I don't want to dine covered in ants..""..I should have walked out right then...She moved us a few tables over still in her section...she took our drink orders and my husband joined us...he said whats wrong, so my daughter told him. I was trying to calm down.. My hubby ordered a Budweiser Draft, while we ordered tea with lemon..she asked us if we wanted the souvenir glass, I said NO THANKS we are not tourist...we live here...so when she brought the drinks it was in a souvenir glass about a donkey's ass..cute glass..never thought anything about it..My husband said this is NOT Budweiser..so when she came back with the rolls and cinnamon butter..he said HEY what happened to the Budweiser..??? she said we don't have Bud on draft..he said well you should have said something I would have ordered it in a bottle..she said..well most people can't tell the difference..  we laughed...he said well after drinking it for 40 yrs I know the difference...she stood there...hands on hips...He said I will drink this but bring me a bottle of budweiser please...She came back with the budweiser in the bottle, and said I will have to charge you for both..I said as loudly as I could without shouting..WHATEVER LADY!!! I was really upset at this point but we had already submitted our order..the manager NEVER came over to our table..not even for the usual ""is everything okay check!!!"".....Our food came..it was okay!! by this time, even if it had been a ""a ha moment"" when you take that first bite..I would have still been pissed off.. when she brought us our ticket...she charged for me a draft beer $3, a bottle of beer $5 and a souvenir glass for $3.50...I said hey wait a minute...are we suppose to keep that glass you took earlier???? she said NO..!! I said then why is on my check???? she said OH, I will get you one in a box!!!  I told Tony, wonder how many people pay for a souvenir glass and just walk out without looking at their ticket...??? I asked for the manager at this point and she said that he just left  for a few minutes but should be back shortly....what??? what??? I have to say I AM REALLY PISSED at this restaurant and I don't think I will be back anytime soon..I had to wait a few days to write this review because I wanted to be calmed down..I hope if you go to this restaurant your experience is better than mine!! If you are going to drop $50 on three meals and drinks...you should expect a better experience...there are too many restaurants in Nashville to be abused and over charged....but please enter and enjoy, have your own opinion!!!

"2520 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,They have completely redone the menu and amazingly this place is good. Seriously for a chain place I was impressed with the changes. I have twice just to make sure the first time wasn't a fluke but I have had great service both times. Damion was awesome and he never let my drink empty. I never really liked this place before and It can get very crowded on the weekend but it was very good. So get there early and ask for Damion and eat the cheesecake.

"2520 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"I really wanted to rate this restaurant higher. It started out at least at four stars and then continued to go down. We were staying at the Hampton Inn Opryland and were in town for a conference. We didn't have a car so stuck with the restaurants within walking distance during our stay. One of the hotel staff said this was her favorite restaurant nearby. We tried going last night but the wait was over an hour long and we were hungry so ended up walking to John A's. We gave it another try tonight and were seated within 15 minutes. They have a lot of benches to wait on, which is nice, and they said to help yourself to peanuts. This was my favorite part- the peanuts were great and you have to admit that it's fun getting to throw the shells on the floor! The menu has a great and interesting selection. We didn't get an appetizer because we were eating so many peanuts, but they sounded particularly good. The dinner rolls are really delicious, served with whipped butter or cinnamon butter. Our server was pretty helpful with the menu. She kept apologizing to us every time she came to our table- for forgetting the butter for the rolls, for the wait for the food, etc. When she brought our food she looked at us and asked, ""Is there anything I can do to make it better?"" We were pretty relaxed and don't think we were giving off a vibe that we were unhappy- maybe she was just trying to give good service? It seemed kind of weird. My husband got the Death Burger which was spicy and cheesy. He said it was messy and that the bun couldn't hold it, so he ate it with a knife and fork, but he really enjoyed it. He didn't like the potatoes he got with the burger, which was surprising because that's usually his favorite thing. I got the New York Strip steak and didn't care for it. It was fatty and greasy but also somehow dry. I ordered green beans (because I read another review that said they put bacon in their green beans and I usually love that) but they were SO salty and had a weird taste- I couldn't even eat them. I asked our server if I could have cole slaw instead and she said yes, and took the beans away. The coleslaw was thick cut and also not my thing (I loved the coleslaw at John A's, though). I had the sweet potato which was also not great- it had way too much butter on it that just pooled inside the potato like soup. The desserts looked good but by this point we weren't thrilled and were ready to go. We had mentioned to the hostess and to our server that it was our anniversary and they said ""Happy Anniversary"" but didn't engage in conversation or offer us something extra. I guess they do offer people to-go drinks, which is a nice touch. Overall, it was a place that looked and sounded much better than it turned out to be. It did seem popular, though.",Santa Fe Cattle Company,6158857852,514 reviews,2011-10-01,"Colorado Springs, CO",/biz/santa-fe-cattle-company-nashville-4,2.0,66,"Washington, DC",Kara Z.

"203 N 11th StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"After all the attention Pizze Real is drawing to itself via a personal campaign against yelp and its reviewers, I came to the Pizze Real Yelp page, and I noticed I have never written a review for here. The following is an honest, unbiased review. I have been here four times.  I have never  experienced bad service. I have been served by the same person each time. An (and I hope she doesn't mind my description) elderly lady. She's always been a good server.The decor: I had no problem with the interior design, or artwork, or furniture. The food: I have usually stuck with pepperoni and sausage, and adding garlic each time. The pizza is definitely NOT the worst in all of Nashville. That title belongs to Soulshine Pizza in Midtown. But Its not the best either. The crust is definitely too thick. -Just a personal preference. And it could use a little more sauce. Not bad, but not great either. Its pizza, and at least the ingredients are of a higher calibre than other pizza places I have eaten. The only reason I came in here in the first place was because of location. If you are hungry and in five points, then it does the job. Five Points Pizza is just better in my opinion. Its not that I am being paid to say this, its not that I am biased. The basis of this review is on food alone. The Yelp description of two stars says it all: ""Meh. I'v experienced better.""That sums it up.  Anyone of average intelligence can filter through the obvious planted reviews (five star and one star alike). The furniture and decor, and interior and patio - there's nothing wrong with that. I personally haven't had a bad experience with the service. Nothing would really prevent me from returning here. But with Five Points Pizza just a short walk away, they seem to be getting all my money instead.

"203 N 11th StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Let me start with the fact I've heard of the newsworthy ""review wars"" on this place, but never felt I had a say either way. Though a long time East Nashvillian I had only been here one time, years ago, and I don't even think I ordered pizza, although pizza is one of my favorite meals. I thought whatever I had then was good, but I just hadn't gone again since, but for no real reason. I don't eat out lots, though a foodie. I like variety, and I try lots of places when I do go out. After my experience, I couldn't help but have a say. Saturday, after spending all day in the sun as a tent vendor at the Tomato Art Fest (not to mention the busy prep that let up to the event), and finally packing up, I was famished. My partner and I couldn't decide where to go that wouldn't have a long wait, since 5 Points was still bustling.One friend mentioned that the food there was great, though I'd heard others say it was a waste of time and money, but I thought I'd give the benefit of the doubt and call in a take home pizza since we were ready to go home and rest. I was told it would be around 15 minutes, so 15-20 minutes later we went to pick it up. I figured the place was hopping, so I intentionally gave the place plenty of time. The woman had not even put our ticket in!!!I had told her my name when we reached the counter and that I was there for a pick up. She recognized my name since it is unusual anyway, but the ticket was still on the pad in front of her!!! She is there to take orders, take money, and clean up.  It's NOT that difficult. She apologized immensely, of course, saying it was a long day, and although angry, we agreed to wait for our pizza nonetheless. We were already there. I always give the benefit of the doubt. Within 60 seconds she turned to text on her PHONE! That was when I said FORGET IT! I could SEE why my ticket wasn't a priority! Obviously things must have been slowing down since an order hadn't been taken in over 15 minutes--she wasn't TOOO busy. She was slow enough to stop and TEXT. Was I forgotten because of a recent text? It seems so!That was absolutely TACKY, CARELESS, and IMMATURE. I'm not gonna lie, I occasionally text at work, but when you have fucked something up because of your own stupidity, regardless of how long your day was, common sense should tell you not to let the customer see you text. She probably more worried about the party later. C'mon. I've worked many years in customer service, and I know it's long and tiring, but clearly this girl has other priorities and needs to get it together if she expects to keep a job and stop making other Millenials look careless and lazy. Pizze Real needs to get a better staff. I read plenty of other reviews AFTER my experience, and I'm clearly not alone. I'd like to describe the woman, but I'm not intending to get anyone, but if I were this owner I'd read this whole review to the staff and make some strict rules. FAST.This place was given both a chance and the benefit of the doubt on a long day, and it will NOT get a chance again or any recommendations from me!

"203 N 11th StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Awesome pizza. Almost didn't try because of bad reviews. Glad I didn't listen. I am assuming they came from their competitor. Because of the great pizza, I can only assume their competitor wrote the many bad reviews. I hope this appalling behavior by competitors does not continue on other yelp sites, as this would be the end of a great site for information on restaurants for me.  Hopefully YELP will find a way to stop competitors bad reviews. I will be a little more skeptical of yelp reviews in the future.",Pizze Real,6152262206,1 review,2014-11-19,"Franklin, TN",/biz/pizze-real-nashville,5.0,87,"Washington, DC",Sarah M.

Although the I will say, the 1 bite size piece of chicken was delicious. $10 for the piece of chicken the size of the papa john's pepper that came on my plate, 4 bagel chips and a salad made from a Kroger bag?

"203 N 11th StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"The reviews of this place seem pretty fixated on bashing the crust. It might not be the crispest crust in town, but that's not really the basis of what makes me value pizza. There are a lot of elements that go into making a good pizza pie. The ingredients here are top notch. Everything tastes super fresh. The sauce is incredible. And the much lamented crust? It's buttery, thick, and delicious. Add to it the fact that this place has a picturesque, panoramic view of five points and the Nashville skyline beyond, and I think you have all the makings of a delightful evening. I have visited most of the pizza places around and I'm baffled as to how this one gets passed over. Maybe it's just that people know they can't go here to see and be seen. That's fine. Your mistake is my gain.

Obviously not to everyone's taste from the other reviews here but I dig it. The menu is very limited but everything they offer is fantastic: pizza, kabos, salad, labne. I always get a greek salad and the labne appetizer (goat cheese yogurt served with delicious warm bread, kalamata olives, and roma tomato slices). You will be full and content, but could also split some pizza with friends. I recommend wine.

Too bad the cheese was garden variety shredded 'white'. If a menu is *this* limited; everything should taste amazing. Maybe the specialties are better, but a cheese slice should be solid. Burnt + bland = one star. They'd be better off if they consulted my school cafeteria on where they purchase their Sysco freezer pies.

"203 N 11th StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"We have been long-time customers especially on rainy nights because they are close to us. In the world of pizza, there are many styles from New York (says this New Yorker) and Nashville has a few solid local spots with a couple of fine places for by-the-slice, but is better for its rarity, especially the elusive Sicilian square slice which is rarest for dinner. The Neapolitan single-serving is more common in Nashville as of late and has solid spots to try. Chicago is rarer still but deep dish and even the small square cuts on thin crust rounds has a new Germantown venue. Then there is New England style--sometimes thin crisp or other times Greek-Boston style baked in a pan. Pizze Real is decidedly the former and we have been partial to the sausage with fill-in-the-blank rather than the more loaded pies. But the added benefit is the Greek touch of its owner; we often go for the mezethakia and the shish kabob which includes tomatoes, homemade bread, Kalamata olives and Greek-style yoghurt with olive oil and marinated pork cubed and grilled. All-in-all, solid fare and more than pizza. And tonight we tried the new addition adding Peruvian ceviche, which is made with larger cubes of fresh tilapia, celery, and a nice slow build of chili-lime marinate. The Peruvian part made us nostalgic for one long-gone Peruvian place in Nashville. So in the palace of pizza (""House of Pizza"" in New England), there are many rooms--this is a worthy variety and solid alternative.",Pizze Real,6152262206,10 reviews,2014-09-16,"Nashville, TN",/biz/pizze-real-nashville,4.0,87,"Washington, DC",Kenneth S.

Besides being unbelievably expensive (and I don't mind paying money for good pizza), the food was just forgettable.

No business should put Pizza in this position. Pizza and I are buds, we go way back, but its like I just found out that he slept with my girlfriend. The mere fact that I could see Five Points Pizza from this place almost made me cry while chewing. I kid you not - a Little Caesar's Hot and Ready has this place beat by a long shot at 1/5 the cost.

"203 N 11th StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I really expected more out of an East Nashville original restaurant. Simply put, one should look elsewhere for pizza. As much as I want to love this place, I cannot. Here's why:They were dead on a Saturday night at peak business hours. Other Five Points restaurants were booming, but this place was a ghost town. About a quarter of the tables are occupied by patrons, with no one dining on the porch. I walk in and I see a gentleman busing tables, but no servers (there was an ad in the window advertising for a server position). I get that it is a seat yourself type of place, but it seems like it would make more sense if the guy took on duties of both a server and a busboy for the sake of efficiency and brevity. Next, I notice the decor is a bit homey, with its breakfast nook style of dining room tables, local amateur art on the tables and a festoon of Christmas lights and greenery dangling from the fireplace mantle.  It is obviously a mom and pop joint, so I feel like I shouldn't be to harsh on the environment. Can't judge a book by its cover, right? Plus, their sign outside looks pretty awesome. Love that metalwork, but I digress.Speaking of the sign, the sign for this place advertises ""pizza, (salads? I forget) kebabs, and more!"" However, the menu is limited to pretty much these items. The short menu only takes both sides of a laminated 8.5"" x 11"" sheet of paper to fill. I was having second guesses when I see pizzas prices $20-$22. But hey, it is Five Points, right? Prices seem fitting. I also notice the beer menu which seems oddly lacking given the impressive beer selection at most East Nashville restaurants. The beer was fairly priced but the local selection of brews only went as far as Yazoo. I order the Tuscan Garden pizza, which the menu (completely in a bolded Impact font, btw) boasts as ""It's like a party inside your mouth!"" Enticing...While I appreciate most of a Simpsons quote on the menu, the party that was supposed to occur in my mouth was a complete bust. Despite being ready in a prompt and convenient 20ish minutes after ordering, the pizza was obviously underdone. When delivered to the table, the pie had several steak knives sitting atop it, like unwelcome guests to this supposed party. As I saw away at the tracks made by the pizza cutter, I quickly discover the dough is mostly underdone, especially in the middle, where the cheese is not completely melted. The dough was not crisp by any means, hence the difficulty in cutting through it. I slop a slice on my place and notice a water mixture of otherwise very delicious ingredients pooling in the center of the pizza pan. I mean, dough doesn't have to be crispy to be good, but I feel the need to express the rawness of it. The bottom of the pizza sported a mild brown color in spots, but it was underdone. The ingredients flopped off as I ate it and the pizza sauce was more akin to a water mixture of diced tomatoes rather than a traditional paste with spices, texture and that good ol' pizza sauce flavor.  I would have rather had a salad, though honestly, the stuff atop the pizza was great and probably would be more at home in a salad.Aside from the mediocre pizza and limited beer selection, the service was decent and our server was polite and courteous. I hope Pizze Real makes some improvements in staffing, decor and most of all, their food. I really would love to see a place like this thrive, and I wish the best to the restauranteurs.",Pizze Real,6152262206,1 review,2014-03-10,"Murfreesboro, TN",/biz/pizze-real-nashville,1.0,87,"Washington, DC",Jessica B.

"203 N 11th StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Pizze Real is unfortunately a place I dont think about visiting often, I think it is the limited menu. You have to either be in the mood for a Greek salad, Kebab or a pizza, thats it. This can also be a positive thing, but since pizza isnt the healthiest of choices and I don't eat Pork which is their only variation of Kebab on the menu, I dont visit much. We came in for dinner Saturday while attending the Green Wagon block party across the street. The atmosphere is nice, an old house renovated to a degree to be a restaurant, they have a nice patio although it was too hot that day to enjoy. The interior isn't much cooler as Erin J. noted in her review, it appears they are either being energy conscious or they haven't updated their A/C. It is a tad bit warm, but cozy none the less. Our service was prompt and friendly, I do remember last time I visited a few years ago it wasn't great so it can be pretty hit or miss. Our server was nice, helpful and prompt this visit. I ordered the medium Greek Salad which is incredibly tasty. I love the dressing, the olives and the feta (I know typical Greek salad, but the dressing can make or break it) and this one makes it. It is over priced to say the least $4.50 for a single serving salad, enough for one adult is over priced when it is limited to olives, red onion, tomato and feta. We ordered a Large Cheese Pizza and added two toppings - the pizza is pretty fairly priced. The cheese is good, I really enjoy the crust which isnt too thin or thick. My other half loved it as well. PizzeReal is definitely a nice place to have in the neighborhood and we will definitely return when we are craving pizza and salad and aren't in the mood for my Fave Roma, who cant compete with PizzeReal's over priced Greek Salad.",Pizze Real,6152262206,111 reviews,2011-06-27,"Nashville, TN",/biz/pizze-real-nashville,4.0,87,"Washington, DC",Jenn Z.
"203 N 11th StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I've visited Pizze Real many times and thought it was good. I really enjoy their mezathakia (a plate with bread, Greek yogurt, tomatoes, olive oil and Kalamata olives) and I haven't been disappointed by the pizza either. I'm writing today because I find it so infinitely frustrating to patronize a business that just can't get its act together. Today was the famed East Nashville Tomato Art Festival, which is rumored to be attended by 100,000 people. This event is not a secret and I think it's been happening for about 10 years now. I went to Pizze Real with my overheated & hungry 6 year old. We went inside to sit and I had no clue where to go or who to ask for a table. The staff was nonexistent. I finally shimmied my way around a corner to someone standing behind a bar to ask if we could get a table. She said, ""You can have one if you can find one."" Nice. Since I didn't want to stand over the diners like a vulture waiting for their chair, I convinced my son to sit outside where there were already vacant spots. Our waitress was sweet and warned us that it would be 45 minutes before we got any food. That was okay; I was enjoying the people-watching and there was enough cloud cover so we weren't roasting in the sun. In the meantime, I watched a parade of people walk up the steps into the restaurant and turn around and walk back out. Probably about 50 in all. One man sat at a table next to us with his baby. He was there for quite a while when he finally turned and asked if they had taken our order yet...the poor guy was just NOT being tended to. One more customer out the door. I was told that they had 2 servers, 2 bus people and 1 person in the kitchen because someone didn't show up which meant that there was now only 1 bus person because the other one ended up helping out in the kitchen. Ugh. I'm just saying all of this because one would think that this would be the biggest business day of the year for this place. Like I said, Tomato Fest is not a surprise event that nobody knows about in advance. Why in the world would they not just say, ""All hands on deck!"" Someone to greet people at the steps & take their name, 3 people bus-ing tables, filling waters & helping make salads, at LEAST 3 servers... you get the picture. In this economy, it's just stupid to run your business in such a lack luster fashion. This restaurant was given a gift and they absolutely blew it. I just sat there watching all of their money blow out the door.",Pizze Real,6152262206,3 reviews,2011-08-13,"Nashville, TN",/biz/pizze-real-nashville,2.0,87,"Washington, DC",Meredith B.

"203 N 11th StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Wanted to check this place out: it's so well-situated and crappy restaurants don't last long in East Nashville. Couldn't be that bad, right?We were ignored when we walked in, which should have been our first indication of what lay in store. We walked to the counter after a few minutes and asked if we should seat ourselves and we were sort of waved in the direction of the dining room. We chose a table and sat. Granted, it was a Friday night and they were busy. Our waitress came over, took drink orders, brought drinks back, took salad and dinner orders, and brought back the salad relatively quickly. So far so good. When the pizza appeared, the kebobs (for me; I can't eat wheat) did not appear. It also wasn't said whether they were coming at all when the pizza was dropped off. After about 10 minutes of watching my husband force down a few slices if pizza (he likened it to freezer pizza) I proceeded to try to flag down the waitress to ask her where the kebobs were. She IGNORED me. Every trip past the table she looked away, looked down, did not even glance at the table. Finally I stuck my hand out in her way when she had nothing in her hands, I smiled, and said ""hey, are the kebobs coming--"" ""They're on their way,"" she said, interrupting me. Rude.Then, when I finally did get the kebobs, they were very tasty. Good marinade, crispy from the grill, tatziki was solid. I was enjoying them and starting to forgive our waitress when I cut into a larger piece of pork and found it verrry pinkish red. When squeezed, the juice was not clear. It was red. Bloody. Not okay. I don't know about you, but getting trichinosis from a substandard pizza joint is NOT my idea of a good time.By this time, we were done, ready to go,  cut our losses and get out. Waitress was on IGNORE mode and couldn't be bothered to give us our check, let alone hear about the undercooked pork. After 20 minutes, we stood up, walked to the counter and asked for our check. Fortunately, I didn't get food poisoning from my dinner.  But I warn all against this place. Avoid.

The Wildhorse Saloon is on the same block along with a bunch of other places to hear live music just walking down the street.  Nashville's great, isn't it?  Anyhow, if you're in downtown Nashville and you have a hankerin' for some spaghetti, you won't be sorry you gave OSF a try.",The Old Spaghetti Factory,6152549010,34 reviews,2015-04-02,"Travelers Rest, SC",/biz/the-old-spaghetti-factory-nashville,4.0,93,"Washington, DC",Aaron V.

"160 Second Avenue NNashville, TN 37201",3.0,Great location downtown. Recently renovated inside. Menu is what you would expect. Strengths:Food is consistently good. Interior is very nice and includes a bar and large dining area. Bread is always fresh and will have you wanting more. Walking distance for downtown workers. Opportunities:Does not open until 11:30 which hurts for business lunches. Plenty of competitors open at 11 am. Service on occasion can be slow combined with opening later really makes scheduling lunches around meetings tough. Friendliness if staff is hit or miss depending on the day. Summary:Good place to grab Italian if you are in downtown Nashville.,The Old Spaghetti Factory,6152549010,47 reviews,2014-04-07,"Nashville, TN",/biz/the-old-spaghetti-factory-nashville,4.0,93,"Washington, DC",Clay W.

"160 Second Avenue NNashville, TN 37201",3.0,"I hadn't been to the Old Spaghetti Factory in a looooooong time until it was chosen for a work department lunch this month.  I had somewhat fuzzy memories of liking it, but they have now been replaced.  Service-wise I have no complaints... nothing above average, but nothing negative.  I ordered something that was supposed to be a specialty... I hated it so much I ended up just filling up on bread. Way to waste the chance for a good meal on the company's dime, Lisa. Ugh. My fault I guess for not ordering something ordinary like lasagna?Since they accommodated our large group without trouble and got us in and out fairly quickly with decent service, I can't give them any less than 3 stars, but food-wise...wow.

"160 Second Avenue NNashville, TN 37201",3.0,"Overall very disappointed with my meal, the Chicken Penne.

Hard wood is everywhere, the ambiance is basically my favorite part.Obviously the Spaghetti here is what it's all about. If you like cheese, then the Mizithra sauce is a must. My personal favorite varies between the marinara or meat sauce.  You could also just do what my mom does and get the pot pouri, which has all three of those as well as the clam sauce in smaller portions on one dish. All in all the atmosphere is great; the food is great; and most of the entrees come with a side salad, bread, and spumoni  ice cream.

"160 Second Avenue NNashville, TN 37201",3.0,"I'm from NYC so convincing me of good Italian is difficult. I don't ever go to chain Italian here(why in the world would I??!) but I must say that this is by far the best Italian chain out there. I stumbled upon OSF in St. Louis when I was starving and in the mood for pasta. The choices and prices attracted me and once I stepped inside, so did the decor.First off, if you are looking to eat on a budget, this is the place! A salad, meal, dessert with coffee/tea is only about $11depending on the meal, and they don't skimp on the portions. That time I ordered a pasta I never saw before. Spaghetti w/ Mizithra cheese, a salty, sharp Greek cheese from a cow or sheep. It came in a brown butter sauce and that was all it needed. I was in love. While hanging on 2nd Ave in Nashville on a visit, I spotted it and went in for another visit. This time I went with a simple spaghetti with meat sauce, good but not fantastic. It was rich in texture but not so much in rich flavors. Nice place to go for a pretty good, inexpensive Italian meal with just about any type of group.

Because of this, the Spaghetti Factory is my favorite restaurant in Nashville.As an adult, this love and fascination has carried over. My experiences there are usually decent, though sometimes the service can be lacking. Most people complain about having to pay to park, but the low dinner prices for entrées usually balance out to still be within reason even after paying to park, especially in comparison to other nearby restaurants. I've found that if you don't like to wait for a table, going during the week is best. The weekends and when other major events are going on downtown can almost guarantee an extended wait. While I'm not a fan of having to wait for a table, the Spaghetti Factory is at least spacious enough to accommodate many people waiting.

As I said, this is a place that your kids will get a kick out of and it won't burn a hole in your wallet like Rain forest might.

The front-line staff is generally very responsive when I ask them to change their gloves before making my burrito bowl. I may have gotten a confused look or exhausted eye roll once or twice here, but that's far less than other locations. The bin areas are definitely a concern for cross-contamination at Chipotle in general, especially with the cheese next to my beloved guacamole. While Chipotle's guac is gluten- and dairy-free, they put it in a bin next to the shredded cheese and it inevitably ends up in the guac, especially at busy times of day when the staff is going quickly. My recommendation for fellow allergy sufferers is to go at non-peak times, keep an eye on the guac, and/or ask if they have a fresh batch they can serve you from.

I usually get either the organic chocolate milk or the all natural Izze (which I've convinced my BF that this is better than soda, so point for Chipotle).The outdoor seating area here isn't as nice as most Chipotle's, though that's mainly do to location.

The mild is basically simple tomato and the hot is tomatillo with red chili peppers. Chipotle Mexican grill is good but with fewer topping selections than some of its competition.

I'm a dog lover, but if the restaurant is going to let them be annoying, they might as well buy a pet patio permit and let them in so they can sit at their owners' feet and be less of an ass.

"3361 Bell RdNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I want you to think back for a minute and get the TV show Cheers in your mind.Go ahead, I'll wait.............. Got it? Good. Now picture Cheers on a lake and add a pretty good food selection. The reason Cheers came to my mind was that from the Owners to the waitresses they seemed to actually know the patrons. So the place had a very friendly vibe to it.  Now, you have to judge this place for what it is. It's bar at a Marina that serves good food. It's not a 5 star seafood restaurant nor does it claim to be. Although I can honestly say that chicken sandwich was very good and the fries didn't taste like warmed up Sysco products. The Cajun chicken bites are freaking amazing and make sure you get the ""Cove Sauce"" trust me you will be glad you read this and listened to me. The beer isn't crazy high and they run a lot of drink specials. It can get very crowded on the weekends though so if you want to eat get there early!

"3361 Bell RdNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"My experience here was horrible. Our server had no personality and seemed annoyed with us from the get go. We sat down, icecream on the table so we asked for  it to be cleaned, which, our server seemed to be aggravated we even thought we should have a decent area to eat. When asked what beers were available, she asked well what do you want?  I guess there is no beer list or maybe she didn't know?  We ordered fried pickles and nachos for our appetizer. Fried pickles were good and hot, nachos..... not so much. The pork was cold - not Luke warm, COLD. We sat there for about 10/15 minutes for our server to stop socializing with her coworkers so we could ask for napkins since we had none. Took our food about 40 minutes to come out. The girl who brought our food was nice and cheerful. The fries were Luke warm and soggy. The fiesta chicken salad was horrible. The lettuce was soggy as if it had been sitting drenched in dressing for a while. The chicken was almost non existent and cold. The piece I did eat was like eating mashed potatoes. So 4 bites of the salad and I couldn't do it any longer. Chicken tenders- luke warm. The cheeseburger was Luke warm, the way the cheese looked you could tell the food had been sitting for a while. I was out of a drink, 2 people out of beers, they were almost finished with their meals and finally our server decides to check on us. (We hadnt seen her since she dropped the napkins off) We tell her about the salad, she says she will tell a manager and offers 1 guy a beer and walks away. Then comes back with the beer and the check so I guess she was ready for us to leave. Didn't even offer dessert or to split the check. She was very prompt, however to come take our money. If I come back, I will probably get fried pickles and maybe sit at the bar to see the beer offers. Everyone else seemed friendly and nice.

"3361 Bell RdNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Good food, but it took FOREVER to get to the table. The service was good - drinks came quickly, orders taken shortly after - but the kitchen clearly didn't have the same sense of urgency. Our table consisted of two meals - chicken tenders and a burger. Only about 1/3 of the tables were occupied, so I have no idea what they were waiting for, because tenders and a burger shouldn't take any more than a few minutes.30 minutes later, when we finally had our food, it was at least good. A little expensive, but you expect that when you're eating on the lake. A friend just got a boat slip in this marina, so I'm sure we'll be back this summer; hopefully it doesn't take so long next time.",Shipwreck Cove,6158728800,47 reviews,2013-05-02,"Nashville, TN",/biz/shipwreck-cove-nashville,3.0,39,"Washington, DC",Ozro D.

"3361 Bell RdNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"If I compare Shipwreck Cove to what it was before (The Cove) its leaps and bounds above where it was. If I compare it to other restaurants of a similar caliber, its ""on par.""The biggest thing Shipwreck Cove has going for it is its location. (Parking is a little frustrating, but its at a marina so I suppose that is to be expected?) My husband and I love eating right on the lake, and by far its the best place for doing just that. That fact alone will draw us to come out again and again. The menu is wayyyyyy better than it used to be. Food pricing is spot on, and you actually get enough food to justify that pricing. I actually took a to-go box home, which pleased me immensely. Flavors are pretty average (at least of what we had). I liked the food and will definitely go back! It just didn't make me rave over it. But, hey, I'll keep trying other things and if I find an item I can rave over, I'll come back and do so!!They now serve liquor, which was a pleasant surprise! However, something having to do with it being served in plastic cups made the amount of drink for the price very disappointing. I'll stick to beer next time (which is priced on par with other Nashville establishments). Finally, the staff is great.

So me and 3 friends loaded up and went over to give it a try.  I've learned long time ago what some people thinks is great is not always something to get to excited about.  $12 for a hamburger that taste OK but majorly over priced for what I got. Positively nothing special about it as far as taste. Maybe the big difference is my friends are always drunk when they go there and I wasn't.

They prepare them with a dry rub.  They are moist, fork tender and well seasoned. As I was leaving I could smell the smoke from the grill area attached to the main building.  I almost went back for seconds! My wife had the same sides as I and the fried chicken.  Her chicken breast was moist, tender, fried to perfection and seasoned to the bone! Yes, they serve the sides from a buffet at the counter and yes then chicken and fish spend a few moments under a heat lamp (like many other Meat N Threes).

"1307 McGavock PikeNashville, TN 37216",3.5,"I was looking online for a place to get soul food one day and I saw this place on Yelp. People raved about it and said that it was sooooo delicious. I arrived and wondered if I was at the wrong place but it was the right place. My intentions was to eat in but there was no where to really sit in there. There were maybe about 3 tables to sit and I'm not the one for sitting in cramped places. As for the rating, this place was ok for soul food. I had the ribs which were thin when it came down to the meat but the sauce was good I will say, the baked beans were good, mac and cheese was cheesy, dissapointed in the lack of seasoning on greens and the strawberry cake was really good! I ate the cake riding down the road home. Yea, shame on me! I'd give it another shot at a later date maybe even if it is to just drop in for some strawberry cake! A special note: Take cash!

"1307 McGavock PikeNashville, TN 37216",3.5,"Without exaggeration or bias, I can say that Bailey and Cato not only has some of the best soul food in the city, but perhaps some of the best Southern food you'll ever have the pleasure of eating.  This is another of those places that is big on taste and quality and gives little regard to appearances.Eating at Bailey and Cato is literally like wandering into an ancient Southern woman's kitchen--she'll offer you chicken and dressing or meat loaf, and she'll even let you eat there.  There isn't a lot of room, but it's usually pretty devoid of non-carryouters, so you'll have the place mostly to yourself if you eat there.  There are daily specials (such as meatloaf and two sides for $5 on Sundays), and they are always a steal.All of the sides are good, though my favorites include the fried corn, mac & cheese, sweet potatoes and greens.  The cornbread is phenomenal (tastes like perhaps it's dosed with a small amount of honey), but they offer rolls if you're not into the c.b.  They also offer several options for your meat, though I haven't yet sampled the smoked chicken.Bailey and Cato isn't some hip, organic-touting, healthy restaurant, but these people are friendly (though typically in a hurry) and they'll feed you better than your mom will.  They only accept credit cards if your dinner is more than $10, but I'm not sure there's anything else negative to say about the place.  It's great for picnics, lazy Sunday afternoons or fooling your family into thinking you've cooked some soul food yourself.  You MUST try this place.",Bailey and Cato,6152274694,349 reviews,2008-04-14,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bailey-and-cato-nashville,5.0,41,"Washington, DC",Patrick R.

"1307 McGavock PikeNashville, TN 37216",3.5,"A classic meat and three joint in Nashville. You can easily miss it like it did since it blends in with the neighborhood homes. But once you're inside, you can smell all the delicious goodness. When I go to a place like this, I can't not get the fried chicken. So that's what I got. Hot, oil bubbling, crispy and salty, this was really good fried chicken. I probably sustained at minimum first-degree burns in my eager attempt to devour this. I will take blame for that.

"1307 McGavock PikeNashville, TN 37216",3.5,"Bailey & Cato is primarily a take away establishment that specialises in southern home style cooking. I had their meatloaf and a number of sides. You can eat in but there is only a couple of tables and becuase their servery area is small, you would have every customer lined up for take away looking at you as you eat. Pros: Serves a purpose for the locals who are on their way home from work looking for a southern home style cooking fix. Reasonably priced and they have special meals of the day. Worth trying if you are in the area and looking for a take away option.Cons: They can be a bit slow serving customers and although their food is nice, B&C did not stand out as a place that offers a true point of difference in a city packed to the rafters with southern style eateries and take away's.",Bailey and Cato,6152274694,22 reviews,2011-05-29,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bailey-and-cato-nashville,2.0,41,"Washington, DC",Brad C.

"1307 McGavock PikeNashville, TN 37216",3.5,"I am a fan.On my birthday I didn't want to go anywhere fancy, I wanted to go some place country ass. I wanted real soul food. B & C is family owned and has definitely been there since all those trendy joints opened up on mcgavok and riverside. The parking is a shambles, you're likely to get blocked in as people are coming and going, B & C is mostly a to-go joint. I think the reason Bailey and Cato has a bad rap on yelp is that they don't cater to the folks on yelp looking for that trendy mom & pop joint secret spot. They've been around so long they don't need to please trendoids looking for a speed record and the best fried chicken in the country. They make what they want, how they want, and it pleases their long time foundation of customers without needing more. For anyone looking for something cute and sparkling this is not the place to go. B & C is as rundown and greasy as you're going to get. They need to seriously scrub the windows and walls, and the place feels like it might fall over at any second. As a family restaurant they've got the way they like doing things down. I'd come with cash as they don't take $10 or less on cards, and I'd be prepared to wait in line as they aren't some corporate speed machine giant behind the counter. They won't take orders if you're on a cell phone and you're probably not going to get a smile out of anyone. You want their food you have to wait and fit into the way they do it.We did. I ordered the pulled pork, green beans and mac & cheese. My boy ordered the catfish with yams and greens. They fry the cat fish in big batches on a rotating schedule every 15 minutes or so, so he had to wait for his, but it soon came and we dug in. Now I have to say everything was very good and felt like family made recipes. As in don't expect some ridiculous remix on soul food here. Like I said, there are original recipes gran makes but it's not your gran making them. The yams were stellar, I have no idea what they put in them but I don't think I've tried yams like that before. My pork was perfectly tender and juicy, and I think the sauce they gave me had a hint of either soy or teriyaki don't quote me on that. The catfish was crunchy and moist inside and great with hotsauce. The hush puppies were excellent, sort of like less sweet donuts. Now I'm giving Bailey and Cato only 4 stars because yes I have had soul food that I like more, based on preference...no one has Bludso's in Compton beat yet. But I appreciate B & C, although they could stand to smile at least. I hope they last a long time, and I hope they continue to do it their way.",Bailey and Cato,6152274694,641 reviews,2011-03-27,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bailey-and-cato-nashville,4.0,41,"Washington, DC",Caitlin C.

The combination was fantastic. Very much a new take on ham and cheese and very grown up. The bagel itself was crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.

If you have had vegan treats at The Wild Cow, chances are Vee made them. The reason why I am such a fan of the treats is that its real food with all the flavor you hope to find in your cakes and pies. Im talking no artificial coloring, no additives, and of course no dairy or egg. You can look at the icing on some cupcakes and tell that.. hey thats not food coloring.. thats blueberry juice!

They were like a cross between petits fours and mini muffins. No doubt there is a formal term for such, but my typically non-sweet-tooth-self is not well-versed on things bakery.These vegan, gluten-free, and nut-free bites, baked with lemon and filled with raspberries were inhaled in seconds flat.

No really. I'm convinced that ViVi (the mastermind behind Vegan Vee) somehow bottled heaven and put a little sprinkling of it in her cupcakes. I can't do gluten and my fiancee can't do dairy, so moving to Nashville from New York, I had pretty much given up on the idea of ever again enjoying something sweet. Luckily the Google gods were on my side the other day and I found myself on the Vegan Vee website, trying to decide between pumpkin chocolate chip, peanut butter crunch, and carrot cake cupcakes. Decisions, decisions ...Sadly, Vegan Vee does not yet have a brick and mortar store, so once you make your decision (based on the menu on her website), you send her an email and wait 24-48 hours for her to make you a special, customized order. For better or for worse, this process means that you'll be forced to eat (errr order) at least a half dozen cupcakes at a time, but there are worse problems to have. I ultimately chose ""kids confetti"" (for the big kids that we are). Walking through the former hardware shop where ViVi houses her ovens, I swear I got high on the smell of baked goods. The cupcakes were still warm (like I said, she makes them to order!) and couldn't have been more fresh if I'd cooked them myself. With our first bites, we knew we'd stumbled onto something special - the cupcakes were just so fluffy and delicious and, had we not known better, we never would have believed they met our dietary requirements.

I think I'll need to repeat and expound.I used to be a fan of this place, back before Green Hills became a 24/7 traffic jam but I can see quality is no longer a concern here. I think they feel they'll get eaters either way because of their prime location. The food can be wretched, but even at it's best it's only average. Do not order seafood from here, as I've had shrimps from Chinese takeout places that were larger. I don't understand why these places think they can charge a premium for fishy tasting seafood and tiny 40-60/lb shrimps. Scallops are similarly small and fishy tasting. Service is indifferent at best. I had an extremely poor experience around New Years and I never received any response to my comments to management or corporate. Steak marsala is generally decent. When the pasta isn't like glue because it's been overcooked so badly, it's edible. But yes, I have been served a plate of glue with no apology or refund.

"4014 Hillsboro CirNashville, TN 37215",3.0,"I knew it! The location serves larger portions. It's true. Plus their fries are thicker and the Matzo Ball soup is consistent. We live equa distant from the original and this one. The portions were larger here. Also our server was amazing and so was everyone there at the Green Hills location. This is NOT to say the servers at the Vandy location are not stellar, however they are so busy and the Green Hills peeps had more time for us. My son and I go or the soup when we are sick and sandwich to take home for later when we know we will be hungry but just to flipping tired to cook. I know bad MOM, but  whatever gets you thru the day to feed your kids. The clientele are usually more family oriented where as the downtown one is more professionals and students and musicians. Always fun to watch. Neither are better. On Saturday's both are the same. Again. I love both! Miss the Chicken in the Pot bc it was so good but the Chicken soup is so nice to have made for you when your MOM is not around. We also had the NY Chocolate egg creme. No egg involved. Not exactly the same but you get what you can. Normally ALWAYS get a Reuben but this time, just the soup. Reuben never disappoints except it used to be bigger which I stated last review.

"4014 Hillsboro CirNashville, TN 37215",3.0,"The wife and I popped into Noshville in our attempt to hit some locally owned spots during Restaurant Week. Being a Nashville native, I have heard about Noshville for a long time, but never have been able to go. We found ourselves in the area about 1:30 on a Saturday and decided to pop in for a late lunch.We were sat immediately upon entering. They were busy, but there were a couple of tables open. We sat down and were greeted immediately by our server (less than 30 seconds...big plus in my book) who took our drink orders and put in an order for the soup of the day (Mushroom Barley). The coffee was strong, bold, and full-flavored, some of the better restaurant coffee I've experienced. The soup...well, it was utterly divine. Available on Saturdays, their Mushroom Barley soup is perfectly cooked mushrooms, what appeared to be pearled barley, beef broth, and a blend of fresh herbs. I love mushroom-based soups, so maybe my bar isn't that high, but it's certainly an excellent soup that I will enjoy attempting to duplicate at home. My wife ordered a Hot Ham and Cheese double-stack with American cheese on Sourdough. Served with fries, it was an obscenely large amount of food. The sandwich was meh, especially considering the price (9.49). It appears that Noshville follows the American trend of equating value with large portion sizes. Her ham was a little crispy around the edges from where it appeared to have been tossed on a flat-top griddle for a little too long with too little attention. I ordered the Monte Cristo. I was really, really excited about this Monte Cristo. I've visted the Noshville website several times over the last couple of months, thinking about when I could find an excuse to stop by and order it. I very nearly drooled a couple of times from pure anticipation. Unfortunately, like most things in life, the anticipation was far better than the actual experience itself. The sandwich, for those of you unfamiliar with Monte Cristos, is an egg-washed and battered concoction usually filled with ham but occasionally turkey as well, as was the case here, cheese, and in this case, served with raspberry preserves and a dusting of powdered sugar. The sugar was overpowering. It was almost like a funnel cake. I spent the first couple of minutes trying to knock as much of it off of my sandwich as I could. The raspberry preserves were a nice touch, especially considering the turkey was nearly as dry as sandpaper. If you can't tell, I was thoroughly underwhelmed. As a plus, the fries were pretty good. Taking the whole experience into account, even considering I loved the soup and the service (our waiter really was awesome, I wish I remembered his name), I can't in good conscience really give three stars to Noshville. The Monte Cristo was a real let down, and the fact I paid 30 dollars (plus tip) for this experience really discourages me.

"4014 Hillsboro CirNashville, TN 37215",3.0,"A joke. I used to eat at the Broadway location quite often when I was going to school downtown. The portions were gigantic and the food was mostly good. A nice grilled cheese and tomato with a basket of fries could be had for 8 bucks. Now the portions are small and the food just sucks. And the prices are the exact same. Popped in for a quick lunch with a friend. I had the brisket sandwich, she had the Cobb salad. First, the food took 15 minutes to prepare even though the restaurant only had 2 other parties in it, for a total of 8 patrons, and we had ordered cold food.  My brisket sandwich was microwaved and they didn't even bother to pile the meat properly on the bread: it was in a rolled up wad that they slapped between two pieces of nasty rye bread. The meat was tough and tasteless and cold in the center. Generally, when you roll up slices of meat into a wad and then try to reheat it while in a wad, it will be cold in the center. Imagine a baumkuchen, but made of meat instead of layers of cake. Not very appetizing, is it. Cole slaw was decent, but it wasn't going to redeem a 10 dollar sandwich. The Cobb salad was pathetically small. 9 dollars and I swear a Wendy's 4 dollar salad was 2x larger. When I go to a deli, I expect a big salad. I don't even need to go to NY to know that, anyone who's seen Seinfeld knows that. Don't call yourself a NY Deli. The only thing NY about this place are the prices. Quality is severely lacking. Quantity as well. And the Egg Cream is just nasty.",Noshville Delicatessen,6152693535,80 reviews,2012-04-09,"Nashville, TN",/biz/noshville-delicatessen-nashville-2,1.0,70,"Washington, DC",Howard L.

The service was very good and the food was fine, but for a turkey sandwich lunch I thought $18 was a little ridiculous.

The quantity of food is high, but the quality of food is low. The meats are always dry, the bread stale, the lox questionable.What's honestly most irritating (as several other readers have sagely pointed out) is that they claim to want to re-create the New York deli experience as authentically as possible.

"4014 Hillsboro CirNashville, TN 37215",3.0,"I remember reading on Noshvilles website a few years ago how a group of ""investors"" went around New York and tried all the great ""Delis"" there and how they wanted to bring that back to Nashville. What I would like to know is what delis are they basing their so-called New York style sandwiches off of?      This is a place I want to like. I want it to be a place I can tell people to go. I want to say ""Hey go to Noshville, not Jasons Deli."" Unfortunately after giving them chance after chance I can say that I'm giving up. I don't mind paying $10-$13 for a good corn beef, reuben or pastrami sandwich when its properly executed. The Noshville ""standard"" doesn't meet or exceed my expectations in quality or quantity.    The corn beef and pastrami is not properly trimmed of fat and is somewhat dull, too thickly cut and chewy. Ok, they have an extensive b-fast menu. Who can screw that up? They have lox & bagels. But!! The one thing you dont do when your proclaiming to be a ""New York"" style delicatessen is screw up the sandwiches. C'MON! When I gotta shell out almost $16.00 for a ""standard"" $11.00 sandwich in NY with better meat, then you've lost me.    Maybe the investors had a good idea, but I guess thats why they're investors and not owner operators.",Noshville Delicatessen,6152693535,27 reviews,2011-08-07,"CANE RIDGE, TN",/biz/noshville-delicatessen-nashville-2,1.0,70,"Washington, DC",Frank C.
"4014 Hillsboro CirNashville, TN 37215",3.0,"Noshville is very eh to me. I'll eat there because I miss eating at real Jewish delis once in a while, but I end up disappointed every time.Authenticity is one of my biggest problems here. I understand that they bring bagels and stuff in from NY, but that alone doesn't make it the real deal. The first time I ate here I was SO excited to see Matzo Brei( fried matzo) on the menu.  As soon as I gave my order the server for some reason decided she wanted to try to correct me on my pronunciation of Matzo Brei with an "" OH! You mean you want an order of the Matzo BREE"" (Wrong! Matzo BRYE...at least in my family and everywhere else growing up."") and when it came out it was just an omelette with some pieces of matzo thrown in there. Big sad face from me to that.The sandwiches aren't bad, but when ordering anything hot like eggs the chances of it actually being hot when it reaches you are pretty low.Maybe my expectations are just too high for a great Jewish deli/diner in Nashville (I still dream of it.) Or maybe I've been spoiled growing up in a family where Matzo Ball soup didn't taste like a bowl of salt water.

Also, my toast was soggy and just bad.The place was packed, I don't know why, I guess the people that live around there don't give a shit about what they eat. I mean. I had to wait a long time for my shitty food, I would never go back, I guess there is not many other places to choose from.The second time I went, to see if lunch was any better, was another waste of my time. I just wanted a pastrami sandwich people, why is it so hard to make a pastrami sandwich outside of New York? I mean, they have a guy on damn near every block that can make a pastrami sandwich. I know I sound like a bitter outsider, but a sandwich is not a hard thing to make, shit publix can make a decent pastrami sandwich.

One of my favorites is a grilled cheese (sometimes with tomato or bacon) on sourdough. They also have soup and half-sandwich combos, though I wish they had more selection on the sandwich part.

"4014 Hillsboro CirNashville, TN 37215",3.0,"Here's a pretty strong little deli.  I haven't been to the one on Broadway, so can only tell you how I feel about the one in Green Hills.  As much as I dislike spending too much time in the Green Hills area, this is one of the better places in the city to get a damn fine brisket, Reuben or virtually any other deli-style sandwich you're into.I used to valet at Noshville, but I can tell you it's absolutely ridiculous to let a valet park your car here.  The lot is always half-empty, typically with a few empty spots withing thirty feet of the front door.  Regardless, the food is great and the service tends to be good.  They have a breakfast menu packed with a lot of really tasty items, including griddle cakes and several styles of omelette.Prices at Noshville aren't too bad.  You can have a very satisfying meal for around $10, and it won't take the staff ages to seat and serve you.  Their menu is really expensive, and they even have just about every type of juice imaginable.  If you can think it up, they can make it.  While Noshville certainly doesn't top Mitchell as my favorite deli in the city, it comes pretty close.  Go.  Have a nosh.  Enjoy!",Noshville Delicatessen,6152693535,349 reviews,2008-05-20,"Nashville, TN",/biz/noshville-delicatessen-nashville-2,4.0,70,"Washington, DC",Patrick R.
"4014 Hillsboro CirNashville, TN 37215",3.0,"It's sad that so many Nashvillians actually think this is deli food; if this was New York, they'd have been stoned out of business long ago. And it's no wonder that their health rating is usually in the gutter. The tomatoes are always the cheapest, mealiest in town. Half the time the pickles were frozen and end up mushy. The latkes (potato pancakes) are usually grey from sitting out too long, and that's just breakfast. I really really wish Nashville had one great Jewish deli.

"316 Mccall StNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"From the day I've come to Nashville, I've heard Thai Phooket this, Smiling Elephant that. Those are both okay destinations, I suppose. However, it is evident to me that neither of these constitutes Nashville's best Thai option. Thus far, I have to hand that trophy to Siam Cafe, whose rich flavors and quality ingredients have come the closest to reminding me of what I can get back in my native CA.One product that I've had a tought time finding in Nashville is a really good flat noodle. However, Siam's Pad Kee Mao indicates that at least one place knows how to make them right. Furthermore, I was really impressed with this place's intuition on spice level. I wanted something medium-highish and this place knew right where to go. Perhaps the most special thing, though, was their squid. I loves me some fresh squid, and it was one of those rare times in Nashville where it didn't taste like it had been frozen for three months after having washed up on shore after Deepwater Horizon.Room for improvement? The service was unattentive...waiting for water when you're burning up on Thai chilis isn't the most pleasant experience. Also, the onions were cooked a bit sloppily...I was getting occasional whiffs of undercooked onion which I personally don't enjoy.

One if my fav salads and this one is just as good as the som toms in Los Angeles. Soy Sauce Noodles (pad see ew) were good too. Scrambled eggs with broccoli, chicken and flat rice noodles stir fried in a sweet soy sauce. Their pad see ew is a little more gravy like reminiscent of lad na.

My food was sadly not quite what I expected after reading the description on the menu but was still seasoned and cooked perfectly. If you like basil, definitely order the spicy noodles. My boyfriend kept asking to trade with me he liked it so much. His curry, we agreed, was probably the best we've eaten in Nashville. It was so creamy and flavorful.

"316 Mccall StNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"This place is so amazingly good! I'm fairly new to Thai food so before this experience, I had nothing to compare it to. My husband and I did an urbanquest one day and it led us to Thai Phooket. After eating at Siam, I'm going to have to lower the stars on Thai Phooket. I ordered the steam dumplings with peanut sauce, Tom Yum Koong (is that right? I'm going by memory here) and green curry. It was all fantastic! So flavorful without being over-powering. The customer service we got as soon as we walked in the door was amazing. I told the lady behind the counter that it was our first time there and she explained it all to us. There was a buffet or you could order off the menu (for those giving Siam a low score based off their buffet - I recommend you go back and order off the menu. The buffet is very basic with fried rice, noodles and a meat. I wouldn't even try the buffet). The place is small-ish but they have it separated where one side is for the buffet and the other side for dinner patrons. It has a very cozy feeling and some of the tables have a little pillow thing where the back rest is. Our waitress was great. We never had to ask for our drink to be re-filled. I actually stuck with the water instead of ordering another drink. Normally when we go out and I order water it ends up tasting like it came from the tap. Their water was actually really good which is a big deal for me. Speaking of water, I ended up drinking a lot of it because of how spicy my meal was BUT that was a good thing! I asked for hot and my server said, ""How hot? Hot or good hot?"" I said, ""Good hot.""

"316 Mccall StNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"I'm not much of an expert when it comes to Thai foods.  For a vegetarian in Nashville there're usually 2 or 3 choices at the places I go, and very little reminds me of the delicious fiery death of the vegetarian Thai food I had while in the Philippines that I was convinced was going to put me into a hospital, nor the peanutty goodness of the San Fran veggie Thai places I used to visit.Siam Cafe does not remind me much of the other Thai I have had, but that may be because they only have 3 entrees that are veggie.  What they do have they do quite well and should be remembered for it.Their spring rolls are delicious.  It pains me that they serve them at a temperature more befitting a funeral pyre than a foodstuff, which necessitates waiting for them to cool to a more reasonable temperature.  Waiting is the hardest part.  Keeping your 2 rolls safe from your compatriots falls a close second.The 2 veggie entrees they have are delicious.  The one with noodles (would sure help if I wrote the name down here wouldn't it) reminds me a little bit more of Chinese food than Thai.On our last visit the wife and I ordered all the veggie foods they had (3 things?) sans salads.  We both had ordered them hot (the levels of heat as I recall are mild (ketchup), medium (a jalapeno touched this), hot (I can handle a pepper or two) and Thai Native (which if it's anything like I had overseas I am not going to touch without money on the line)Hers came back at what we both considered on the mild side of medium, mine came back on what I would call the milder side of hot.  Which was just enough heat to clear the sinuses, but not enough to switch into pain / begging for water or milk.We're not sure if they downed the heat on hers thinking she could not handle it, or if mine just absorbed more heat, but it's fair to note that heat levels may not be what you think they will be.Finding the place, it will help if you street view on google maps first.  It's up a bit on the corner, sort of pushed back from easy viewing on a street that's not an obvious god restaurant down here street.  parking is tight, so plan to carpool.",Siam Cafe,6158343181,573 reviews,2010-10-25,"Nashville, TN",/biz/siam-cafe-nashville-2,4.0,69,"Washington, DC",Paul K.

"316 Mccall StNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"Being a creature of habit, I most often order the same thing at Thai restaurants, however, after doing some research, I decided I wanted to try some Issan-style Thai so I asked the lovely lady who seated us if they had a special ""Thai"" menu. She enthusiastically pointed to the menu on the table. I think she misunderstood and I said, ""what I mean is a special menu from which Thais order"" and she again pointed to the same menu. So, I further asked her if they did any Issan specialties that are not on the menu.  She said ""Laab"" so that is what I ordered. ""Laab"" (sometimes ""Larb"") is an Issan-style meat salad, very pungent, usually spicy.  My dining companion and I ordered the Tom Yum Kai (not on the menu), Laab (not on the menu), Som Tum, Pad See Ew (not on the menu) and Red Curry with Chicken, all ordered at native Thai spice level. I explained that we like our Thai really hot (native Thai hot). It was very, very hot and lovely, but not the incendiary spice-level for which we were looking.The Tom Yum Kai was exquisite and redolent with lemongrass and Kaffir lime leaf; the Som Tum, pungently sour with fish sauce, lime juice and dried Shrimp, and shredded green papaya.  It was the perfect foil for the blazing Laab (ground chicken, lime juice, Thai bird chiles, red onions, cilantro on a bed of lettuce).  The Pad See Ew was quite delicious, as was the Red Curry. Unfortunately, the red curry came topped with some of the ground chile powder instead of chopped Thai Bird chiles (which are truly incendiary).

Maybe it's because I usually go at lunch and we usually end up getting something from the buffet. In which case, I feel like a two-star ""meh"" says it all. On the whole, I love Thai food, but this buffet is your standard Asian fare per mall food courts. You know the kind: glazey, breaded chicken... sometimes sprinkled with sesame seeds; fried rice; soupy broccoli with chunks of beef; chewy eggrolls. It's not the kind of food one should necessarily be excited about. Perhaps ordering from the menu is different. I'm kind of hoping it is.Also, lesson learned. No matter how delicious your friends tell you the Thai tea is, do not order it unless you can handle the sweetness in a 5lb bag of sugar. I couldn't finish mine and ended up wasting the $2.50.Free refills on soda though! There's a plus.As others have mentioned, the parking situation is EXTREMELY limited.

Atmosphere:Call me wierd but this place looks like a converted laundromat and I LOVE IT.  Its homey and not trying to be something its not like your typical asian restaurant.  I've seen staff family members running around the place on numerous occasions.  Call me crazy, but at night time its well lit and comfortable.  Great place to share dishes with whomever you are with.Finally, the lady up front and who serves sometimes is fricking hilarious.  She might catch you off guard joking around but she's really funny.I could complain about the parking, but its a small family owned Thai place.  Cmon, its about the food!",Siam Cafe,6158343181,10 reviews,2010-02-15,"Smyrna, TN",/biz/siam-cafe-nashville-2,4.0,69,"Washington, DC",Brett M.

"316 Mccall StNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"Siam cafe is one of those places that you might pass up on appearances. This is hands down my favorite Thai place in town!! However, I have never been impressed by the entrees. I have tried a few of them and they don't rock my world. Why do I give it four stars then? Because and this is a HUGE because, the Tom Ka Kai is something I crave in my dreams, when I am sick, when it's hot, when I am thirsty, when I happy, get the picture? I have had a few different versions of Tom Ka Kai in other cities and restaurants and I feel Siam makes a wonderfully rich coconut concoction with just the right subtle hints of lime, ginger, chili's that just make my taste buds sing. My husband and I order the large and it comes in a large metal donut shaped bowl with flame in the middle with a side of sticky white rice. This really is enough for two people as a meal. Now, the other wonderful thing I LOVE here is the steamed dumplings. I horde these things like an alcoholic hordes his boos. I don't even let my kids smell them for fear I might have to share. I have never tasted anything like them but sometimes I think I could write epic tales worthy of Homer after having eaten them.

There are several thai restaurants within a couple miles of my apartment, but the 20 minute drive to Siam Cafe is worth it!!! The place itself is quaint and comfortable, always with friendly service. I always order the chicken satay and I am amazed every time at the peanut sauce. I don't know what they put in it (maybe applesauce?) but it is addictive. I also love their Massaman Curry...definitely the best ever. It is the perfect combination of creamy and spicy, with tender chicken and perfectly cooked potatoes.

The only thing Ive really ever had here is the tofu green curry and I am more than ok with this. I love this meal and this is one of those hidden gems in Nashville.If your into trying any of the curry items, here is a tip that me and my girlfriend at the time use to do on togo orders: get just one order of curry  which comes with a large side of rice and then order another side rice for 99 cents (free if you dine-in) and its plenty of food. The servings are big and last night when I order some I tried to eat it all and though I nearly did, I couldn't. This meal that feed two nicely cost about right at 10 bucks. Its really hard to beat that.parking has always sucked here but, I noticed last night they now are using the parking lot across the street which is a huge difference.I cant speak for the buffet they have or nearly any other meal besides the other curry options but, I have eaten at numerous other Thai places in Nashville and I can say its the best curry in town and many people on and off of Yelp agree.",Siam Cafe,6158343181,36 reviews,2010-03-18,"Nashville, TN",/biz/siam-cafe-nashville-2,4.0,69,"Washington, DC",C S.

"316 Mccall StNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"I am a Thai food fanatic. I consider Nolensville a gem of a road (despite popular belief - ever been to Las Cansuelos or International Market?) so I was excited to be hungry about the time I got flashed by nearby prostitute (not kidding) and realized I'd never been there before. My ""vegetarian friend"" and I were seated and a little excited by the 70s-ish time travel dining room. For starters, I got the hot and sour, and she the Tom Kha. My friend ""forgets"" to make sure that dishes are meatless (I've seen her surprised several times when eating out), so of course hers had chicken in it and mine only shrimp so we swapped. I must say I am a huge fan of the hot and sour (over Tom Kha). The Tom Kha was very, very sweet to me and ""real coconutty."" Instead of an entree, we got salads. I'm not sure what the name of the one she ordered (but the fried tofu in it was the best I've had) and I got my favorite Thai salad, tiger tear. I was excited when she offered me rice, which makes it more of a complete meal, and it ended up only being a dollar extra. I ordered ""hot"" which it wasn't... I must be getting accustomed to Thai spice because I would rank it as mild. The meat was great but not as good as my favorite tiger tear restaurant, Golden Thai on White Bridge. We found out from a guy working there that it is the first Thai restaurant which is a plus for me.

"7108 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"Terrible service experience a few weeks ago. Really disappointing as we've been going to various Brewhouses for nearly a decade and even had their food catered at our engagement party. We went in on a Monday night. I'm exhausted and about 8 months pregnant. We are about to order dinner. My husband orders a beer and I order a water with lemon. We are both carded because of the smoking allowed inside. I left my wallet in my briefcase earlier that day at work. I explain this. I am told we will not be able to stay if I don't have an ID. I say we come here every week can you ask a manager to make an exception. Waitress leaves. Comes back, says bartender doesn't recognize us so we'll have to leave. I was really pissed. I still am. And it really bums me out that I will never go back here after our conversations with the waitress and bartender. Trying to be fair, these employees felt they'd lose their jobs if I stayed in there and ate without giving them an ID. Maybe that is a legitimate fear but I just wasn't buying it and don't like how they handled the situation and chose not to use any discretion. I don't like that they turned away our business that night, couldn't have given two craps that we are regulars, and now I don't get to eat my favorite food. Ever again. I guess we don't need the second hand smoke anyways but this was just really disappointing.I'm sure the food is still as good as my old 5 star review so I will leave it here:Yum. We go here once a week. I don't like the smoke but the food is ALWAYS so good. Favorites include: big daddy burrito, brisket quesadilla, jalapeño crab soup on special, and the spicy/chipotle ranch on everything. Oh and their cole slaw is spicy and delicious.

This is one of those terrific neighborhood pubs that can make a North Carolinean jealous.The beer. They manage to have a terrific selection of draught beer without being all fussy with having strictly craft beer. Don't get me wrong, I love a Yazoo or Sweetwater 420 (both of which they have), but everyone has moments where they'd just as soon a Bud Light. I believe that in total, they have something north of 20 draught beers. The food. After two meals here, I'll say that they manage to be a step above some bars. They manage to break past the burger and wing monotony. On my first visit, I had catfish. As an original Arkansan, I must admit that off-the-beaten-path fish house catfish certainly has them beat, but it was tasty. Most recently, I had the big daddy quesadilla. They weren't joking about the ""big."" My only complaint was that they could be a little crispier. My quesadilla standards may be a bit out of touch at the moment since I most recently had them crafted by an executive chef.The service. My beer never went dry. Good service without being fussy. I cannot stand someone constantly interrupting the course of conversation. Our server did an excellent job.The atmosphere. I love the indoor/outdoor feel of this place.

The short version of what I've said in other BB reviews, I usually get the quesadillas but the burgers are good as well and the specials always sound pretty tasty. Skip the salads. Phew, now that that's out of the way lets talk drinks. Bushwackers -- love them! But fair warning, they are strong!

"7108 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"I'm going to prefix this review by stating that Brewhouse Midtown is my favorite bar in Nashville. Having said that, this satellite location doesn't live up the standard I have become accustom to at Midtown. On one hand it certainly feels like the Midtown location inside - an abundance of LCD TVs, rickety looking building, garage door walls, and the ever famous plethora of Bushwackers at just about every table which themselves are worth an automatic 3 stars for any establishment. On the other hand a very key component is missing... the draft selection doesn't seem to be even half of what the Midtown or South locations carry. Is it probably the best bar in the West Nashville area? Yeah buddy.Even though the draft selection isn't huge they still have better than average options including most all the Yazoos which like Bushwakers carry an instant star bonus.",Brewhouse West,6153565005,174 reviews,2011-04-23,"Nashville, TN",/biz/brewhouse-west-nashville-2,4.0,28,"Washington, DC",Ryan O.

"7108 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"This is the cousin or maybe even brother restaurant (not sister because it has a pretty manly vibe) of the Broadway Brewhouses. I personally like the vibe and the food much better at this one. If you go on Sundays you'll be able to see it easily as you approach, because the parking lot will be filled with glistening rows of chromed-out motorcycles. I really like to sit outside in their beer garden when the weather is nice and drink some draft Yazoos. Although the menu is almost the same as the Broadway Brewhouses, it's a little more rounded out here, and the food comes on real plates, not Styrofoam ones. I hate eating out of Styrofoam! I usually get the gumbo and house salad combo. I think their gumbo is the finest in Nashville because it's thick with small pieces of sausage, and shrimp, and it's also pretty spicy. The house salad comes with jalapeno bacon, cucumber salsa and this amazing spicy ranch dressing. They also have a great burger, which also comes with the jalapeno bacon.I just really like the laid back vibe here.

"7108 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,Brewhouse West has one of the better beer selections on the West side. I personally could care less but this small fact makes Husband very happy. The food is pretty good... however all of their vegetarian selections are laden with beans and cheese. If you are a pesco-vegetarian then you can add fried catfish or grilled fish of the day to the list. If this is not your thing then I suggest you skip it.

"923 Main StNashville, TN 37206",3.0,"With only an hour to spare in between dance classes for a weekend workshop, five of us rushed into Koi around 11:10am on a Sunday. The server received our frantic timeline and orders warmly, getting our dishes to us within 10 minutes. The interior runs the gamut from a dark oak bar area to Thai-style mat seating near the windows to traditional booth and chair seating. The areas all feel pretty cohesive within the mellow, warm-colored interior.Food-wise, I can only speak for the decently priced chicken and shrimp Pad Thai. I would say its the perfect amount of spice (at a level 3), sourness and nuttiness. I wish they offered a bit more vegetables on the side for mix-ins, but still quite tasty. I especially like that they offer a shrimp and poultry option, as the tender chicken combines well with the brininess of the seafood. My friend's Thai tea looked beautifully done, with cream drifting down into a black tea base all held in a gigantic glass goblet.We received our checks even before the meals, a must for those in a rush.

Half the time, service is acceptable, and the food comes out without too much delay. The other half, well... I'm assuming the fish must swim from the Sea of Japan, to my table - because I've experienced up to one hour delays between ordering, and getting food.

The bill between two of us ended up being $60 which is higher than most thai restaurants around town, but whatever, it's Friday.... The kicker comes when I checked my bill statement today and they proceeded to charge me A 20% tip on top of my bill even though I left them $12 in cash.

While we were ordering, we asked what was in several menu items and was told ""I don't know"" and ""You're asking the wrong person.""2. It was difficult to tell who our server was. This is not necessarily a negative thing, but it made it tricky to determine who to ask for help and who was responsible for our party.3. One of our entrees was never entered.4.

I came to visit for a to-go order on my lunch break. The establishment didn't seem busy but my order took a little more than expected. I ordered a spicy tuna roll and octopus roll, very basic but it took a good 25 minutes for my order to be finished. I figured because they're fairly new so I just shrugged it off, despite my time frame. Unfortunately, once I opened my lunchbox the rolls were very messy, very poorly presented. I've never seen a roll that only had 6 pieces? Traditionally basic rolls come in 8 pieces. Two days later I decided to try this place out again but this time I called in. I asked them if I could get extra wasabi and ginger also a side of Sriracha sauce. (I asked the same request the first visit and they forgot.) Went to go pick it up and again, the same messy presentation and NO extra wasabi, ginger or Sriracha sauce. WHHHYY YOU DO THIS TO MEEEE?!

It is hard to blame the servers and bartender when they are simply overworked and the kitchen can't keep up. On the bright side when you get your food it is always delicious. I have yet to eat anything that I didn't like. Will recommend if you do not have somewhere to be right after.

"923 Main StNashville, TN 37206",3.0,"First of all, I am from California and am spoiled with seafood from the coast. I am also a HUGE sushi fan and since moving to Nashville in July I have been searching for a restaurant that can stand close to anything you will find in my home state. This is one of the best Sushi restaurants that I have encountered in Nashville. They have excellent portions of fish and unique rolls that you can customize to suit your tastes. The only suggestion I have for the Sushi chefs is to use a little more sauce on the rolls that advertise it. Since it is advertised as a Thai food restaurant as well I had to try the Pad Thai. I was not disappointed! Just the right amount of spice, tons of vegetables and noodles. This seems to be a one-stop Asian cuisine restaurant. On my most recent visit to Koi I tried their Pho with vegetables and was blown away! The broth is very authentic, slightly sweet, very delicious. The only reason I cannot give Koi five-stars is the service. They always seem to be short staffed and I have ended up waiting for service much longer than I should. Please management, figure it out! Hire more people! The food here is such a success, don't limit it by having slow service.PS- I love that they are always playing jazz music!

"923 Main StNashville, TN 37206",3.0,"This unassuming joint on Main was the perfect laid back experience my fiance and I were looking for! Customer service: We were welcomed at the door, and we were given the opportunity to seat ourselves wherever we'd like. Our waitress asked us what we'd like to drink and was extremely patient when we needed ""a couple more minutes"" every two minutes for ten minutes straight lol. Which leads me to the menu...Menu: The reason it took us so long to decide on what we wanted to order was because the menu was so extensive! They had about 30 beers (craft brews and locals) on tap, a separate sake and wine menu, a regular menu that featured starters and main courses, and ANOTHER electronic tablet that showed you what each roll looked like! I loved that aspect because I'm very visual. Atmosphere: The atmosphere was nothing like I had assumed it would judging by the exterior. It was very modern, eclectic, classy and even had a jazzy night club feel to it. It probably helped that jazz music was playing overhead to set the mood. The lights were dimmed, the seating arrangement was perfect, offering stand alone tables but also bar stools and booths. Food: We ordered the miso soup which was phenomenal for being a pretty simplistic dish, the ginger salad and 3 various sushi rolls. I highly recommend the cherry blossom which highlights tuna with sunflower seeds and roe. Thank you Koi!

I brought my family into Koi last night, a toddler, 3 year old , an 11 year old and  my 13 year old. We were seated fairly quickly and service came within a reasonable time. It wasn't great but acceptable. We ordered a few soft drinks and a delicious beer . The beer came out first and a few minutes later the kids drinks came. We were ready to order and order we did. We got sushi and a couple bento boxes, some edamame and fried wontons. Every thing tasted fine. But, later it it was not so good. That happens, I understand the industry. When I called this morning to let them know I was told "" maybe it is a virus and I might want to go to a doctor"" . I told them I appreciated their opinion , but that that may want to check their service line. I also said I wanted to talk to them before posting anything on Yelp. I should say I asked for a manger , but none were available. I came home and decided to call again to talk with a manager after speaking with my daughter. She was acquainted with the party seated next to us and after a short conversation today they discover both were sick this morning. Diagnosis: tempura oil was bad. When I spoke to the manager she said they had called the owner but the owner said"" I don't know"" .

"346 Harding PlNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"Based on the workers I'm assuming the food is HALAL... If I hadn't already ordered I would have left. The interior is dirty and run down... The gyros tasted like gyros, nothing special, not bad and not awesome, just good. The rice was a yellow rice which was cold... But not inedible.

I love their salad with gyro or chicken. The food is delicious and inexpensive. They also give you a lot of food, I could never finished all of them. I always wanted to try their Kabob but it takes too long for them to cook it since I usually have the food to go. They suggested me to call them ahead before going there. I called them one day and the person who picked the phone seemed either too busy or didn't understand English and just hung up the phone...so until now I still haven't had a chance to try the Kabob yet :( This is why I'm taking one star off.2013/#12",Chicago Style Gyros At Harding Place,6158348500,133 reviews,2013-04-15,"Nashville, TN",/biz/chicago-style-gyros-at-harding-place-nashville,4.0,14,"Washington, DC",Tran T.

"346 Harding PlNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"My one gripe is that gyro places have become so Americanized that you have to specify that you want tzatziki (cucumber sauce) instead of ranch dressing.  Ranch is disgusting, especially on a gyro.  At other gyro restaurants I have literally thrown a lunch away when it is given to me with ranch on it, such is my disdain for the condiment.This is my favorite ""fast"" gyro place in town.  I like that the same guy has been fixing my gyro for about 7 years now.  The meat is well seasoned, the sandwich well dressed, the tzatziki is refreshing, and the fries are always cooked perfectly and to order.  I don't ask for much, and they do it right every time.Also notable, their dolmas, tabouleh, baklava, falafel, and hummus.",Chicago Style Gyros At Harding Place,6158348500,26 reviews,2013-03-26,"Nashville, TN",/biz/chicago-style-gyros-at-harding-place-nashville,4.0,14,"Washington, DC",Katey L.

"346 Harding PlNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"There's a general rule when eating in other cities that I tend to follow. ""Avoid restaurants that claim to serve the food of another city"".  Examples:- New York style pizza in Chicago- Chicago style deep dish pizza in Florida- Philly cheesesteaks in Minnesota- And coming to a town near you, Chicago style gyros in NashvilleThe good news for me is this place doesn't seem to play by the rules.With my imaginery red flag held high, I entered this divey type spot. Having eaten here four times, I'll admit that it's pretty good. Far better than the 85 other nearby fast food chains, Chicago Style Gyros can be a decent lunch spot provided you order the right things. I dislike many policies here from the frozen prepackaged goods pulled straight from the freezer and into the deep fryer to the non homemade meat mixture producing the restaurants gyros. I've eaten the gyro but also the chicken and can honestly say that the chicken blows away the gyro with flavor. When dipped in hot sauce and topped with tzatziki, I was happy with my lunch. The rice served with is tasty but greasy; a nice compliment to to the chicken and side salad. Just make sure you get the cucumber yogurt dip instead of the ranch. The cucumber dip and hot sauce bring contrasting flavors to the party which made my mouth rather happy. Skip the fries.Chicago Style Gyros is a nice spot to get away from the norm.

The gyro sub has all the charm of your standard gyro with all the buttery bready goodness of a quality sub. It's legit. The eggplant parm sub was pretty good too... but a little mushy. I'm one of those weird texture people though. haha.The desserts are also great. We've tried the chocolate suicide cake, the cannoli and the tiramisu. The chocolate suicide cake is money.

"2613 Franklin PikeNashville, TN 37204",3.5,I came to Nashville on a business trip and due to the busy schedule I went back to my room late and decide to order from this place. The sad part is that someone recommended this place. I called to place an order for for several people and I was put on hold and then an old man with an accent. I proceeded to order a few item and I asked him about the Gyro sandwich he answered but I could not understand what he was saying. He then yelled on the phone like if he was annoyed to bother this late. I told him to go ahead and cancel the order because he was rude and since he was on speaker my fiancé let him know what an a**hole he was and I hung up. It does not matter how good your food is I will take my business elsewhere if bad customer service is provided. We called Caesar's Italian Restaurant instead. (Same menu by the way) Whoever is answering phones should probably be more fluent in English and not have a thick accent so the customers can communicate better.

Some friends and I bought our movie tickets ahead of time and with an hour and a half to spare we figured we'd hop over to Jonathans for a few drinks and appetizers.  Boy were we wrong.  We sat in the bar area which is a total bust because it is self seating and it's a madhouse.  You have to be a vulture to get a table.  We sat at the bar while we scoped tables and after a long wait were finally served the wrong drinks.  We just accepted them because we weren't angry quite yet.We moved to a table after throwing elbows and sat at our table for 20 mins (not an exaggeration) before we had to literally find a waitress and ask her to serve us.  She apologized but it felt very insincere.  Clearly it was busy and we get it - but a nice ""sorry we are super busy and understaffed today"" would have been a nice gesture.  After waiting forever for our meal - my friend's meal had meat on it when nowhere in the description of her meal did it say anything about any meat.   She was a vegetarian so this was a big fail for her.  Our waitress never showed back up again.  We still had our same drinks from the bar (the wrong drinks mind you) and we had to find her just to get our ticket.  We watched while she changed the different TV's over and over for other people but seemed to keep forgetting our ticket.  Needles to say we had to get up many times and approach her to get our ticket and finally after we couldn't take it anymore we walked up to her and handed her our cards.  It was horrible.The worst part is that we felt really horrible because it was busy and they were clearly understaffed (It was a Friday night - they should assume they will be busy) but what made us the most angry is that she was annoyed with us not apologetic.  To top off the fabulous night we got to our movie 5 mins late because of our poor service and the entire movie was packed to the rim.  No seats left together or anywhere that wouldn't cause us to break our necks looking up.  So we left.We missed our movie, we had crap food and the wrong drinks. Oh and I forgot to mention I asked for a water at least four times and never got my water..  It was a nightmare experience.We went back to complain after we realized we missed our movie  - we asked to speak to a manager and turns out our horrible 20 something waitress WAS the manager.  Go figure.  Trust me when I say don't waste your time here... the food may be ok but the service is SO bad that it kills the experience all together.",Jonathan’s Grille,6158352073,18 reviews,2015-02-02,"Nashville, TN",/biz/jonathans-grille-nashville-2,1.0,55,"Washington, DC",Tina P.

The queso tasted like it was from a jar. We both got salads and the lettuce was exactly like the kind you would find from a bag. The thing that seemed most odd to me was that the chicken on the salads comes chilled. If you want your chicken to be warm, as in freshly made, you have to pay an extra dollar.

"3805 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.0,"I eat work lunch here quite often so I've had several things off the menu.  Tuesdays are buy one/get one on pizzas and they are good.  The fish/chicken tacos are one of my favorites and the stuffed potato is killer.  Sandwiches and burgers are good and what you would expect at any other sports bar style restaurant.  Salads are good but not ""spectacular""  If you do get one with bleu cheese, ask for it on the side.  They tend to go heavy.",Jonathan’s Grille,6158352073,6 reviews,2014-10-14,"Nashville, TN",/biz/jonathans-grille-nashville-2,3.0,55,"Washington, DC",Brant S.
"3805 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.0,"Overall: It still smacks of YOLOs... but has the familiar Jonathan's menu.Food: The menu says ""it's not bar food"" but let's be honest, it kind of is -- and there's nothing wrong with that! There are more salads than your average pub menu and definitely more interesting entrees but when it comes down to it, it's essentially a smoke and mirrors act. The bang bang shrimp on the appetizer menu works as a meal if you add a side salad. It could use a little more kick, but I bet you could ask for a side of hot sauce (note to self: ask for side of hot sauce next time.)Drinks: My old stand by cocktail (vodka soda with a lime) was strong and tasty. The wine menu isn't great, but chances are you'll find something worth drinking. There's usually a ""beer of the day/week/month"" you can get 2 for 1.Service: I haven't eaten in the actual restaurant for a hot minute, only the bar so I'll keep my review to the bar area. Service is actually pretty darn good. Attentive without being obnoxious. My drink never went empty (until I had a few I cut myself off.)Cost: The food is very affordable but the drinks (like 99.9% of the restaurants out there will get you.)",Jonathan’s Grille,6158352073,333 reviews,2013-04-23,"Washington, DC",/biz/jonathans-grille-nashville-2,3.0,55,"Washington, DC",Lauren S.

Although the restaurant was not busy and you would expect quick service at lunch time, this was certainly not the case. The waitress arrived promptly to take our orders and brought extra plates for sharing. One of the plates had caked on food on it and when we returned it, she said, ""oh, you don't want this"" without noticing that it was dirty.We waited an unusually long time for our 2 salads and burger, even though 3 tables seated after us were served. finally, after asking the hostess to check on our meals, the waitress appeared with our order and said that they sent some severs home because it was slow. The salads had 4 thin slices of chicken on them - not exactly what you would expect for an $11 salad. the waitress never returned to fill the water glasses and we waited an additional 10 minutes after we were finished for the check.  We again asked the hostess to send our waitress over at which point she sent over the manager. after letting her know that we were quite dissatisfied with our service, her only response was, ""I just got here"". We eventually went up to the hostess stand to pay, since the waitress still hadn't  brought the check and finally she appeared, slapped down the check and walked away.

"3811 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I've been eating at this chain for over 14 years now. I think I'm qualified to render an opinion on this particular branch and on the general direction of the brand. The taste is still there. When you bite into a burger, you know it's fresh and decently cooked. The fries are cooked fresh and are still great. But there are little changes here and there that really bother me. For one, I swear the burgers are smaller. 4.29 gets you the ""original"", which used to be 1/4 pound but now they suspiciously leave the weight off the name now. They still advertise the half pounder as the half pounder, but not this one. Hmm....It is much smaller than I remember it. Almost the size of a kid's burger. My experience last night was a little disappointing. The place wasn't that busy, but I still had to wait 15 minutes for my burger and fries. I also had to interrupt the flirting counter person for my burger, as I noticed a burger sitting on the line for a good 5 minutes. Turned out to be mine. Turned out it needed fries, but instead of throwing some in the fryer, they set my burger down and forgot about it all. So I got my semi-cold burger and dressed it while I waited for my fries to be put on and finished. They normally toast their buns, but my bun was stone cold. It had butter wiped on it, but it wasn't toasted...it was just soaked into the bun. They get a tic mark for that. The condiments bar is larger, but not better. The tomatoes were mealy and disgusting. The dill pickle chips, the best reason to visit the bar, were fine. They used to be thicker and have a fresher taste, but they're still passable pickles. Skip the salsa, regular pickle chips, romaine lettuce, jalapenos...it all tastes cheap. They used to feature Gulden's Spicy Mustard, but that's gone. They now only have Heinz Yellow and Heinz Deli mustard. And just because their deli mustard is brown doesn't make it good. Really miss that Gulden's. All in all, a decent burger experience. But then you factor in the price (8 bucks for an original burger, a slice of cheddar and a small fry) and you can get better elsewhere for less.

They even offer a partial bison/partial beef burger, the beefalo. And there was also salmon and turkey.I tried the beefalo, and found it on the dry side.

I think I'll stick with the bison burger patties they may or may not be offering at the Trader Joe's around here.Sadly, the onion rings had a weird batter to them.

"3811 Green Hills Village DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"Having been to several CBC locations I am a fan of their burgers and since we were at mall near this location I was looking forward to a great burger here. Overall the food here was ok, burger was good but the fries lacked there usual good flavor that I have come to expect and it wasn't due to a lack of seasoning...time to change the oil in the fryer! Service was the downside to the experience. Had a guy on the register who struggled to speak English thus had a hard time taking orders....not just ours, I watched as he had trouble with several customers orders and its not like they have an extensive menu. Unlike other locations we never got asked how we would like our burgers cooked either and although I personally like a med-well or well done burger not everyone does. Several tables needed to be cleaned off, another sign of poor service and not once did I see anyone come out into the cafe to clean any off while we were there. Restrooms weren't filthy but could have used some attention too.

"212 Thompson LnNashville, TN 37211",3.0,"Smokies BBQ finally opened their doors a few weeks ago on the day before Thanksgiving. I was hoping to be there for the grand opening, but we were out of town visiting family. Better late than never.This is an offshoot of Mack + Kate's restaurant down in Franklin, which generally gravitates toward more contemporary, upscale Southern fare. Their new barbecue operation is located in a run-down and easy-to-miss shopping center in south-Nashville. I arrived at 11:15am, and despite the advertised 11:00 opening time, the doors were still locked. By 11:20, Smokies was finally open for business.The decor at Smokies was as trendy/rustic as you'd expect from Mack + Kate's. It felt more like a Southern bistro than a barbecue joint. I was fairly cold the entire time, especially when employees were coming in and out of the cooking area. Granted it was 45 degrees outside, but still.Since there weren't any combo plates on the menu, an appetizer seemed in order. I decided to try out their Smoked Deviled Eggs to start things off. For my entree, I ordered the Beef Brisket Platter. I asked for a fatty cut of brisket, which was met by a rather perplexed stare from the girl at the counter. Clearly she's not a barbecue aficionado. Their platters come with two sides, for which picked potato salad and macaroni and cheese. $14.00 sounded a bit steep for a one-meat plate, so I expected the food to blow me away.My smoked deviled eggs came plated with an unnecessary assortment of tomatoes and sliced cucumbers, which I felt no compulsion to eat. The eggs were good, but all I could taste was whole grain mustard. I was also disappointed by the complete lack of smoke. I was glad to have them either way, since my main course was taking much longer than it should have.The big glob of potato salad didn't really look that appealing. As with the deviled eggs, the only flavor I found was an overpowering amount of mustard. There was only a minimal crunch to break up the creamy texture, so I moved on. I could see some specks of black pepper in the mac and cheese, so I had higher hopes for this side dish. It was a little lukewarm for my liking. I also would have preferred more gooey cheese, but at least I could taste the pepper. There was absolutely no reason to serve either of these two sides on butcher paper, when a small plastic or styrofoam container would have sufficed. It gave me the impression that they were trying to imitate the serving style of a small-town meat market, though sadly playing a game that they didn't quite understand.Honestly, I wasn't really sure what this brisket-themed monstrosity was on my platter. Best I could tell, it was a cornbread pancake, topped with sliced brisket, topped with coleslaw, topped with barbecue sauce. The parts of the cornbread directly beneath the meat had turned to complete mush. I pulled apart the tower-o-food and managed to find a little bit of plain brisket to sample. It was a thick slice with good black bark, but it was a tad dry and had sort of a pot roast quality to it. The bark was tasty, but I found only minimal smoke, most of which was masked by the molasses-heavy barbecue sauce. The coleslaw was nice and crunchy. However, I feel like the slaw should come without dressing (or at least with significantly less) if you're going to cover it with sauce anyway. Otherwise there's a weird mayo-molasses thing going on, which doesn't work any better with brisket than it does with coleslaw.I feel really bad giving Smokies BBQ such a negative review because I understand how much time, money, and effort it takes to open a new restaurant. That being said, I found nothing to justify a higher rating. It seems like this place is too focused on reinventing the wheel, when all you really need is four or five spices and some care and love at the smoker. Fans of traditional barbecue are sure to be disappointed. I know I was.",Smokies BBQ,6152923838,541 reviews,2014-12-16,"Nashville, TN",/biz/smokies-bbq-nashville,2.0,14,"Washington, DC",Jared K.

We tried out their chicken & pork sandwiches, baked beans and fried okra and they were all solid and the portions large. Now, I will note that I am someone who prefers their BBQ very lightly sauced -- I like the flavor of the meat to be the star -- and that is not the style Smokie's serves. No judgment, because thankfully their sauce is quite good, but just an FYI. They apparently had a catering job cancel that day due to weather, so we were the lucky recipients of some incredible banana bread dessert that they brought out to us on the house -- super kind of them and super worth every delicious calorie.

If it was busy that would be understandable, but there was a total of six people in the restaurant. Waited patiently and then I saw one of the chefs use a large spoon and scooped something out of a skillet and place in the styrofoam container.  That was my soup.  I am not a chef, but I know that you use a ladle for soup and soup is not cooked in a skillet.When I got back to work I opened the container to find this clump of white beans...no liquid whatsoever.  I like white beans, but not a clump that looks like wallpaper taste.  The cornbread was reminiscent of Jiffy, but with white corn.Maybe their best is the pulled pork, but sides are just as important.Will I go back?  I think I will have to think about it.",Smokies BBQ,6152923838,2 reviews,2014-12-19,"Hermitage, TN",/biz/smokies-bbq-nashville,2.0,14,"Washington, DC",Robert J.

I ordered the brisket platter with mac and cheese and baked beans.  Super tender, no nasty fatty pieces at all and the beans were perfect a bit spicy and just sweet enough.  My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork, looked equally delish! Must have been the way he wolfed it.   Both platters came with pickles, slaw, and surprise cornbread under the meat.  At first I freaked because the slaw was on top of the meat, I don't typically like slaw, if fact I find it rather gross.  But this was different, crunchy, not too mayonnaise-y.  It looked good.  I pulled it off and to the side, mixed a bit in with the brisket and found myself enjoying cole slaw for the first time ever.Now for the real kicker, the roads were horrible here and they were not only delivering they were delivering for the first time.  When the super nice guy came with our food (sorry forgot your name) he said they decided to deliver because people would be stuck inside.  LOVE YOU for that.  We will be seeing you again soon and often!!!!!

My brother ordered a half rack of ribs with greens and white beans as his side and we split the deviled eggs as an appetizer. The deviled eggs were good but not great. My sandwich was sort of lukewarm with not much sauce but the mac and cheese was gooey and cheesy, the way I like it. However my brother was pretty mad that they didn't give him a half rack but rather a 3/4 rack. If you're going to charge someone $11+ for a half rack, you better give them the six bones.

Its tucked away in a small plaza off of Thompson but don't let that fool you. My favorites so far are the ribs, wings, baked beans, and gumbo. Give them a try. Is it the best BBQ in town? Hard to say. Is it a great addition to the neighborhood? Absolutely, and we welcome it.",Smokies BBQ,6152923838,33 reviews,2015-01-23,"Nashville, TN",/biz/smokies-bbq-nashville,4.0,14,"Washington, DC",Cory G.
"212 Thompson LnNashville, TN 37211",3.0,"I was so glad to see this joint opening in Woodbine. My first attempt with a brisket sandwich on the run was just okay. The brisket lacked the character of other Texas BBQ purveyors in the area. On the next visit we sat down and had a much better experience. First lets talk about the collard greens. There is a surprising and delicious combo of flavors at work here: smoky bacon deepens the flavor profile, while a sweet vinegar (maybe pickled onions) adds bite. Cooked to perfection with a slight crunch. The pulled pork was equally sweet and smoky. Must be fruitwood and apple juice. There's something on the wall about Dr. Pepper (in the sauce, on the pig, or both?). The pork was served atop corncakes and slaw. I was surprised by the presentation but really enjoyed the way the flavors sat together. The Mac-n-cheese was more bechemel than cheese but I found it creamy and flavorful. No complaints.I'm certain it will take a few weeks to dial everything in. In the meantime, this place is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.",Smokies BBQ,6152923838,21 reviews,2014-12-18,"Davidson, TN",/biz/smokies-bbq-nashville,4.0,14,"Washington, DC",James T.
