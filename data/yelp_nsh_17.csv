"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,This was only my second time ever going to a Dave&Busters!!  The place is awesome for kids and adults alike. The food was very good! The burger was a bit off in taste so my son didn't eat it but the chicken quesadilla was very good!! Our waitress was super friendly and talked to us as friends not customers. She made sure we were taken care of and never wanted for anything. The kids had a blast paying games and running around. The prices for everything there is very reasonable. I would defiantly go back with the family.,Dave & Buster’s,6159703800,41 reviews,2015-06-22,"Oldsmar, Tampa Bay, FL",/biz/dave-and-busters-nashville,5.0,97,"Nashville, TN",Deb P.
"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,This was a joyful experiance with my wife and side chick. Our waitrees was nice (but a lil stoned ). Chicken tenders were overepriced but fine.

"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"Geeks Unite!In a mission to embrace our awesome-inner-geek we went to D&B for the Dance Dance Revolution (DDR). ----Slight Pause for a DDR Sidetrack:For all you DDR fans out there, ddrfreak.com is out of date for Nashville. We attempted Tusculum Lanes (bowling alley off of Nollensville) first, thinking it would be cheaper than D&B. Sadly, the DDR machine is no longer there and their arcade is super tiny. Back to D&B...We did not eat here so my 4 star rating is of the arcade only. Their pricing was a bit weird. They advertises prices for ""chips"" but their machines list prices in ""credits."" Weird discrepancy, but just know chips = credits. Arcade was fun like always. They've got a few older games (DDR, skee ball, water racing game), but most are new and relevant to the times. Occasionally games give you attitude - beware the skee ball machines: balls go missing - but there's helpful employees around to fix & give you free play.The Nashville City Saver has great coupons. (2) $20 worth of chips for $10; free $5 card; 1/2 off bowling. D&B usually offers deals for signing up for their emails too. Check it out to save yourself some dough.

"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"If I could give this place no stars I would. This place is not at all ""adult friendly"" as one expects from their commercials. There are kids running around everywhere and the arcade area has a limited selection of games. Furthermore, we made the mistake of sitting in the bar area and ordering food since the UT Vs. Georgia game was on and we wanted to watch it. All four of us were hungry so we ordered the spinach dip and chips while we waited for our entrees; we eventually had to ask where our spinach dip was after 40 minutes of wait. Our spinach dip arrived 30 minutes later along with our luke warm entrees. The waitress, who took 10-20 minutes to do anything, pretended this was normal and we asked to speak to the manager. She informed us that the appetizer would not be found in our bills, but that we could still keep it if we wanted. Overall, this was a horrible experience, with mediocre food, atrocious service from a server named Kechia, and a long wait; we were there almost three hour ( almost two of those hours were waiting for food and then eating). To make matters worse, we had to wait 20 minutes just to pay our bills and then receive change because the waitress just vanished. One of us even had to go to the bar at one point and point blank ask her for change for the 100 dollar bill that she didn't bring when she came back with our credit cards. In the end, I understand that it was Saturday and they were busy, but there really was no excuse for how bad this experience was.",Dave & Buster’s,6159703800,7 reviews,2015-10-13,"Greeneville, TN",/biz/dave-and-busters-nashville,1.0,97,"Nashville, TN",Ana B.

"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"Running late to the Opry we thought we'd just get there then find a place to eat, and cringed when we realized our closest fastest option was Dave & Busters.When we walked in the hostess said there's a 35 minute wait to dine which we explained wouldn't work because we were in somewhat of a rush.  She apologized but right before we walked out my friend just asked her if we could eat at the bar and she said yes there's two bars just go up to one of them.  Not sure why she wouldn't have informed us of this option.  So we went to the bar and found a spot right away.The atmosphere was cool and nothing like the D&B in Wauwatosa.  This place was massive.   It had bowling, private event rooms, a few sports bars, dining areas, and obviously games galore.Like I said before, we cringed at the thought of coming here to eat because we had a long night ahead of us and didn't want to eat junk food.We were relatively surprised that there was some healthy options on the menu.  One of my friends ordered the Cabo Chicken ""Two 5 oz. flame-grilled chicken breasts, lightly seasoned and grilled, topped with pineapple pico de gallo and served with spicy rice and steamed fresh vegetables."" and my other friend ordered some Mediterranean Chicken Dish, I opted for the Mac & Cheese (super healthy right?). The food came out pretty quickly, which was good considering our time restraint.   When the food arrived it looked great and picturesque.  Like meals you would get from a nicer place like Cheesecake Factory or something.And to our surprise the food was actually good.  My friends let me tried their chicken dishes, both their chicken was moist and cooked perfectly.   A great tasting chicken dish cooked well from Dave & Busters?  We were in somewhat of a disbelief.  Here we were expecting just crappy bar food, not fancy chicken entrees and when we ordered we had no expectations of them being good.  And they were.  The mac & Cheese meal was great as well, with crispy breadcrumbs on top.When you think Dave & Busters the last thing you would think of is a place to go for a nice classy meal.  Sorry for stereotyping you Dave & Busters.To assume is to make an a__ of you and me.   Dave & Busters made me feel that way.   Perhaps this was just the one in Nashville, but my perspective on D&B is severely altered.",Dave & Buster’s,6159703800,255 reviews,2014-10-20,"Seattle, WA",/biz/dave-and-busters-nashville,4.0,97,"Nashville, TN",Brad K.
"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"The only thing we really enjoyed on our visit was the arcade. Was it pricey? Yes. Were there a lot of random children running about screaming? Yes. Was the food worth it? Hell to the no. At first we were going to eat then play the games but when coming in from the Opry side (not from inside the mall itself) it can be confusing. There was a long line almost to the door but it wasn't for the restaurant portion, just for game cards and access to bowling. The hostess stand is to the left of this line and was empty so we just decided to go to the arcade. Thankfully I had an old D&B card so we could skip activation fees. They have a lot of games and pricing ranges depending on the game. Some weren't worth the credits but some, especially skee ball, are inexpensive credit wise. We did encounter quite a few games that were broken or didn't work properly but there were a few employees on the floor to help with such situations, thankfully. I will say it is very chaotic most of the time and people leave drinks and cups everywhere, including on the game machines. The bar/ arcade eating area was busy and was only bussed once that I saw. When we finally decided to put our names down for the restaurant the wait was not terrible, probably 15 minutes instead of the quoted 30. And this is where the fun stopped. The dining experience itself was not good. The menu is huge and incredibly too long to actually look over every single item before ordering. I went ahead and indulged in a happy hour half off cocktail, the Purple People Eater. The server was nice enough to put in two before HH ended so I could receive the discount for both. The drinks were okay, tasting mostly of HPNOTIQ. For dinner my boyfriend and I both had burgers. He had the Maker's Mark BBQ burger while I had the South Philly Burger. He said his was a little too sweet but enjoyed the sweet potato fries (which were an up charge of course). My burger was okay but was lacking in the onions/peppers combo that it boasted in the menu. My biggest problem with the burgers was the fact we were asked how we liked them cooked, both of us saying ""medium rare"", however the burgers were obviously frozen and there was no way they could have gotten them medium rare from what it looked like. Service was lackadaisical and she seemed to be kind of lost the entire time. I asked for water (sans lemons as I have a citrus allergy) multiple times and when she finally brought it, there were TWO lemon wedges in it. Honestly, by that time I had given up on it and just wanted the check so we could go back to the arcade. I feel this review was probably a little too lengthy but so much about this visit really bothered me. D&B's is an establishment I expect to spend a lot of money at but if they could just match the service and food to what I paid for it, I would gladly return again. I'll stick to giving them my money in the arcade only and find somewhere else to eat next time.",Dave & Buster’s,6159703800,138 reviews,2015-07-02,"Bowling Green, KY",/biz/dave-and-busters-nashville,2.0,97,"Nashville, TN",Jessica B.
"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"Review is for food mostly. No comment necessary on the overpriced games $1.40 and up per play at the mid price point (depends on number of credits you purchase) then each group is 6 credits and up to play. Bowling is similarly overpriced in my opinion $35 per hour plus 3.35 shoe rental per person. Food sounds great on menu. Luckily they show the cal. count for each item. Most are a full day's nourishment.  Many clocking in at over 2000. I ordered Thai chicken salad. Delivered quickly, without the chicken. Brought back in under a min with chicken in top. Ok salad and flavor. Thought it was a bit boring so checked the menu and it was supposed to have fresh cilantro and scallions in addiction to greens and seeded veggies- neither were present. Shredded veggies included thickly sliced raw Brussel sprouts that were almost too tough to eat. Very disappointing overall. I guess I should have ordered the 2300 cal buffalo wing burger...Waiter was nice so service and fun atmosphere get the 2 stars.",Dave & Buster’s,6159703800,13 reviews,2015-08-30,"San Francisco, CA",/biz/dave-and-busters-nashville,2.0,97,"Nashville, TN",Ohhh Y.

"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"I was so excited to go to a Dave & Busters because I live in Washington and this place is only somewhere you see commercials for... So, I can finally say that I know it's real!! The concept of it is really cool, and I can see this being a super popular place in Washington. To start off, we decided to grab something to eat at their restaurant. We were greeted by a rude ass bartender who was like, ""Yeah so, the four o' clock person should be here sometime but I guess I should probably get you guys some drinks."" So we ordered from her, and our drinks were brought by a different server who said, ""Hey guys... I think I'm your server so here are you drinks...."" She was so WEIRD. She ended up being our server which we all were very unhappy with. Either this girl was on the best weed TN has to offer, or she's just not all the way on upstairs, if you know what I mean. The whole time she kept checking up on us she was like,"" Hey y'all, how's the food? Ya gonna play some games? Cool.... Cool..."" and everytime she squinted at us like she thought we were lying. This was seriously an experience that everybody had to be there for to understand just how awkward and weird she was. She literally checked on us like every five minutes, and each time was more awkward than the last. Of course, when we were ready for the check, she was nowhere to be found. It was just weird. She is why I docked 2 stars. The food was okay. My mom and I got the nachos to share, and it comes in a HUGE serving. They accommodated all of our requests (sour cream and guac on the side, no jalapenos) with ease, despite our strange server. The nachos were good, but nothing spectacular. The game center was pretty cool - they had pretty much everything you can imagine and the fact that they load your tickets on your card instead of printing tickets you win, is a plus for me because that's environmentally friendly!! Less paper, the better. Overall, I'm glad I experienced this place and it'd be cool if they brought one of these to Washington. However, they should probably tighten up their standards for their employees because at this point, I just assume ANYBODY can work there as long as they know how to string a few words together and make a sentence.",Dave & Buster’s,6159703800,290 reviews,2015-05-15,"Kent, WA",/biz/dave-and-busters-nashville,3.0,97,"Nashville, TN",Lauren P.
"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"While waiting for our show to start at the Grand Ole Opry, the boyfriend and I decided to walk around the mall and eventually stumbled upon Dave and Buster's. It was a Saturday night and the place was packed! We spent some time checking out the new games in the Midway and got so excited we ventured back and blew through 60 chips in a matter of minutes the next day. We came back on Sunday with the intention of bowling a few games, but at a rate of $35 an hour plus shoe rental, we decided to go elsewhere. As a former employee of the franchise in Atlanta, I've always thought the service can be improved--ironic how that carries through to stores across cities and states. Almost all the employees we ran into at this store showed very little enthusiasm to assist guests and didn't really seem to be in the working mindset--whether it be an empty bowling desk or three employees and a manager hanging out at the front desk. Nevertheless, I've always loved how Dave and Buster's keeps their selection of games relevant to the times and as an adult now, it's still fun to go back and blow lots of money shooting zombies, racing cars, and winning tickets!",Dave & Buster’s,6159703800,424 reviews,2014-05-13,"Atlanta, GA",/biz/dave-and-busters-nashville,3.0,97,"Nashville, TN",Ashley M.
"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"You know, sometimes its nice to revisit childhood. What's even more fun is revisiting childhood with booze. And Dave & Buster's has a perfect balance of the two. Located in Opry Mills, I first came back after they reopened for my BF's birthday party. We had a blast. Also, should you get to the level of 13,000 tickets, I highly recommend making a ticket angel on the floor in front of the prize store. It's quite amusing and awesome at the same time. It's not super cheap, but for the ability to play video games with other adults (if that's your thing) and be able to drink at the same time, it's rather spectacular. Plus, for those of you with kids, it would be a blast for a kid's birthday party with private rooms, a bowling ally, pool, and the arcade area. I went back on half off night (Wednesdays) and it was a lot of fun! Plus a good deal, and I got some candy. :)The food is nothing great, and last time I came here to eat, they listed the calorie count on the menu, (not sure if they still do) but oaf. It wasn't pretty. I think it's great that they are being honest with people, but please provide some more health conscious items if you are listing calorie count! Yikes. Dave and Busters is fun.

I only went to this one because I had to take an ABC permit class for my job. I did not play any of the games but I usually do like the games. This one also has bowling which is a plus. First, my class was in a little separate room which was nice for us. We got to take breaks so we could get drinks or food if we wanted. I decided on my break to go to the bar and order something. It took about 5 minutes before the bartender even acknowledged me. Then, I ordered a tropical smoothie and she never gave it to me.

"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"I've been a fan of this place since it was Jillian's. Since being Dave and Buster's, and definitely since the reopening, there have been a lot more games added which are intended for younger kids and are more about winning tickets. While these aren't categorically 'bad' changes, they don't add to my experience as the 'kid at heart' kind of patron. I like the two player games, air hockey, shooting games, etc. The trivia and touch screen games give a nice variety. Maybe I'm hung up on nostalgia, but I wish there was a combat game or two- even if they were classic games as opposed to new ones. I'd give this place four stars if their games had better (non-ticketcentric) variety. And I'd give five if they displayed a price on each machine instead of how many points each game costs. The whole cards/points system is a bad gimmick to make it hard to keep track of the amount of money you're spending on arcade games. It's best to go on Wednesdays when it's half price games night. Don't be surprised if some people hog a game for hours, though. The servers are very nice, but I can't say the same for the drink prices.

Cost was about the standard rate of 25% markup from normal cost. Tickets come out as values of 2 pts.

"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"My husband really wanted to go here for his birthday because neither of us had ever been to a D&B's and we both love arcades. Parking at this location on a Saturday night is virtually impossible. We were with a group of friends, in 3 separate cars, and we drove around for at least 10 minutes before finding parking.

Keep these cards if you plan on returning  because otherwise it's a stupid $2 activation fee, on top of the price of the number of chips you purchase.

"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"Dave and Buster's is not a place for fine dining or a quiet meal.  Let's be honest: it's where you can get bar food and play games like you're five years old again.  It's loud, in both sound and appearance, the portion sizes are extreme and, in this instance of this location, its located in a very crowded mall that doubles as a tourist attraction.  But when I had a friend in town staying at the Opry Hotel (which is really REALLY nice but let's face it, a drive for those of us living in downtown) D&B was one of the only places nearby open late that served food and booze on a weekday night.  And the staff were really friendly despite it being kind of quiet in there and most likely wanting to close early.  We enjoyed cold beers and a hockey game, and that was a great evening in my book.  This is a great place if you like playing arcade games as opposed to shopping in the mall, or maybe you have guests staying at the hotel and need a place to hang out that doesn't involve a lot of driving.  D&B can help you with that.  This isn't the best food around or the best time Nashville can offer you, but for what it is it's great and can be a lot of fun.  My experience was fine, better than fine.  Better than driving back and forth all night.",Dave & Buster’s,6159703800,299 reviews,2014-05-15,"Nashville, TN",/biz/dave-and-busters-nashville,4.0,97,"Nashville, TN",Bridgette C.

"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"Please keep in mind, this review is ONLY for the bowling lanes at Dave and Buster's...I came here the day after Thanksgiving with family as something fun to do together. The place wasn't terribly packed, but it was busy. Getting a lane was extremely easy and fast, but I will say that $35 per hour plus $3 per person for shoes is a little steep. At least if you don't play an entire hour, they will pro-rate the price based on how long you were there.If you're only taking one lane, chances are, you'll have to share a table space with the people next to you, which is normal. But if you don't have a decent group next to you, it may not be that fun. I'll leave that out of my review though, because that doesn't really come back on the business, since it was the patrons.Our waitress took at least 15 minutes to get to our lane, and when she finally did take our orders (2 beers), it took about 10 more minutes to get them. After that, it was almost impossible to get her back to get refills. I kept having to wave her down, and most of the time she just held up a finger to tell me ""give me a second"", and came over when she pleased. I understand people can get busy, but we watched her and she wasn't. She was busy socializing with other waitresses and customers.The bowling lanes weren't terrible, but about every other frame, the lane would automatically reset on someone during there turn and drop the gate down when they threw their ball. You can go back and correct scores via the computer if you know how, but it takes time and eats into your playing time, which isn't cheap. It's more of an inconvenience than anything.All in all, it wasn't the worst bowling experience I've had, but I've had far better. The main reason we chose Dave and Busters was because they have TVs all over the bowling alley, and we wanted to watch a hockey game as we bowled. Honestly though, if I wanted a better bowling experience, I just would have went to the lanes in Hillwood. I may try this place again, and I really, really hope it's better next time.",Dave & Buster’s,6159703800,41 reviews,2013-11-30,"Nashville, TN",/biz/dave-and-busters-nashville,2.0,97,"Nashville, TN",Ian R.

"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"Based on my only visit to Dave and Buster's so far, I'm giving it 3 stars. My boyfriend is a bit of a video game junkie and he has been dying to play the Pac-Man Battle Royale game so he suggested we go there last night. I was just starving and I knew they had food so I gladly obliged. We sat at the bar in the arcade area and were promptly served drinks by 2 friendly bartenders. They told us about happy hour and I had 3 vodka n' crans which were all on the strong side. Yaay! One of the bartenders even turned on the hotspot on his cell so I could have internet (to check-in on Yelp, of course!). So far I'm liking D & B's. After our drinks were ordered we each settled on the 'Eat and Play' combo. It provided you with your choice of 8 or so meal options and a $10 game card. We placed our order at 5:15. Around 6:00 we started talking to each other about where the hell our food was and I guess the bartender heard and asked a nearby employee to go check on it. A few minutes later a manager came out and asked what we ordered and told us that for some reason they had no record of it in the kitchen. He apologized and told us that our meals were on him and he would have our food out as quickly as possible. My bf ordered the bbq chicken breasts and loaded mashed potatoes and both of his items were really good. The chicken honestly tasted like it had just come off of a backyard grill. On the other hand, my chicken tenders (or as they like to call them ""Golden Fingers) weren't that impressive. Kind of dry and too bread-y. However, the fries were pretty damn good and perfectly salted. I asked for more honey mustard half-way through the meal and never got it. Booo. After we finished eating we played some games (I'm still awesome at skee-ball in case you were wondering) and won some tickets. We didn't have as much time as we had wanted due to the delay of our dinner. Overall the arcade seemed nice enough and there weren't too many kids or teenagers running around getting on my nerves. Like everyone says, D & B's is just a Chuck E Cheese for adults. With booze. I will come back again if my bf wants to but I'm pretty sure I would never come here on my own accord.

"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"I like this place, okay?The times I've come here after Opry Mills reopened have not been riddled with kids and teenagers like I thought it would be - probably because of their new rule, which seems to change according to the time. I've walked in at around 7 o'clock and it was 25 and up! Whaaat? Once they checked my ID and I walked in, I saw a sign that said 21 and up past 10 PM. That doesn't make much sense, but whatever. That may suck for younger people who just want to have a good time, but I didn't miss the teenagers.I can't speak about the food here, but why would you eat at an arcade anyway? You know what you're getting yourself into. I've heard the bowling can be expensive, but I'd rather play at a regular alley regardless. What I do like is the arcade. I will always be a little gamer at heart. The prize center is a little weird - no in-between ground, mostly either candy or toaster ovens and coffeemakers for a bajillion tickets. I switch between both ticket games and just the ""regular"" ones. Nice selection of shooter-style and racing games, but I do miss the Mortal Kombats and Tekken games. Maybe I can write them a suggestion?Probably the most appealing thing about this place is booze. You can get cocktails and good beer while playing some games.

"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"I must say I am a bit disappointed, yet impressed as well. The last D&B I went to was in San Diego CA. The set up was much more convienent, and it was much easier to find help when you needed it. We walked in through the mall entrance and  it was incredibly confusing. There was no podium or ticket counter. It was quite awkward. We walked in, wandered through a bar/seating area and attempted to find someone to point us in some kind of direction! Eventially we got to where we needed to be. Our waitress was very kind, yet forgetful. We were there during the early afternoon though, so they may have had her on the early shift because she was new, so I really didn't hold it against her at all. There was a mishap with our power card, so I started wandering looking for help. I asked a server, who was actually talking to a man who could have very well been the manager. I am unsure, but he had a blue shirt unlike anyone elses and was incredibly professional.  I am very pleased to report that he himself helped me out and quickly resolved the issue. I am always very impressed when I see a manager do something that one of their employees would normally do. He could have easily had the server run to the back to figure out the problem. I think one of the most important things when managing is to never ask your employees to do something you yourself are not willing to do.

"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,I went in and played games for over an hour before my friend and I decided to grab a bite to it in the main dining area. We like to go on Wednesdays to take advantage of the half off deals on the video games and ticket machines. We shared the nachos and a grilled steak salad.  We were both surprised how large the portion of nachos were.  The sauce used in with the meat made them taste even better. I like trying new drinks there so this time I ordered their 'shizzle' drink.  It was pretty good but there are better options on their drinks list.  Our server Windy did a great job. The only complaint I have about our visit is how long it took for our drinks to come out from the bar.  Looking forward to my next visit.,Dave & Buster’s,6159703800,23 reviews,2013-09-09,"Nashville, TN",/biz/dave-and-busters-nashville,4.0,97,"Nashville, TN",Matt U.

Of course, I complained to the manager and he made things right.I could complain about the cost of the games, but my kids had so much fun playing them I figure it was worth the $75 I dropped on game cards.

"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"I'd like to start by saying that I honestly wish I had better things to say about Dave and Busters. I was super excited for the re-opening after the renovations were completed. (The place was destroyed from the flood in 2010) Well, we did not leave impressed. The food was pretty good I'll admit but the service is a whole different story. We had two different servers and it was confusing because we never knew which one was going to show up at the table at any given point, or even which one we were supposed to tip? It's as if they were confused as to who's section we were in. One would think that the benefit of having two servers would be expedited service...but no, just the opposite. After we finished our meal, after spending over $100+ on food and drinks, we made our way to the gaming area so we could have some more drinks and utilize the entertainment. We loaded up the game card with $35 and then went to the back bar (by the mall entrance) to order another round. We must have waited over 30 minutes for someone to acknowledge our existence! There were 7 employees behind the bar! We counted! Most of them purposely were not making eye contact with people. It was almost as if they despised helping customers. Strange considering that's what they were hired to do and the place has only been open for a week! NOT a good start! We ended up leaving, angry, with a wasted game card loaded with $35 unused.

"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"I will admit there is plenty to do here, its not going to be hard to find things to occupy yourself with, but they'll also majorly occupy your wallet.  The place is divided up into several different rooms.  The largest room is the arcade and its jam packed with carnival and video style games.  You can't just put dollars or change in to play them so remember to stop at the main arcade desk to buy some credits.  Being an arcade junkie, this is the part I like best about D&B, although most of the prizes are pretty crappy.The next largest room is the 'restaurant' bar section which is pretty much just a room with a lot of tables and huge tvs on the walls.  I said restaurant like that because their food is pretty terrible and insanely overpriced which is a deadly combo.  Their main bar is quite large and they offer a variety of crazy-named and expensive alcoholic beverages.  I will say that they usually make them pretty stout but that only marginally eases the pain of their $8 and up price tags.Next is the bowling alley that is perpetually in tripped out mode complete with black lights and fluorescent colors.  Theres a smaller bar in here in case you don't feel like walking the twenty extra feet to get to the other one.  This is by far the most expensive bowling alley I've ever been to and in my opinion is totally not worth the price.  Yea the booths at each lane are cool and I like the idea of having a more private bowling experience but the lighting gets annoying quickly and they have a propensity to play terrible music.  Also I find all the TVs to be very distracting (why must TV follow me wherever I go?  Isn't that counterintuitive to going out?) when you're bowling.Lastly they have a smaller area with pool tables hidden in the back corner of the building.  This is probably the quietest area in the entire place and also usually the emptiest.  The tables are actually nice, they are in better shape than I would expect and of the pay by the hour type, not quarter tables.Somebody likened this to Chuckecheese and that's exactly what it reminds me of, a boozed up, more expensive, played out version for adults.",Dave & Buster’s,6159703800,170 reviews,2009-02-05,"Nashville, TN",/biz/dave-and-busters-nashville,2.0,97,"Nashville, TN",Courtney B.

"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,I just had the nastiest meal of my life at Dave & Buster's last night. I ordered the veggie burger (which also happens to be the only vegetarian option on the menu).  Let's just say it's the worst one I have ever had. It came out completely dry with 3 pickle chips and 2 tomato slices on the side. But that was not nearly the worst part. The fries that came out with it (and every one else's fries at the table) smelled and tasted like melted plastic. chemically and gross! So the waiter brought out more fries which ended up being just as terrible. And then promised to find us a manager. Which he never did! Nor did he ever refill any of our drinks. And then he happily brought us our check at the end of the meal. The only thing that really bothers me is that had none of us noticed we would probably all be suffering food poisoning right now or something worse. And to our waiter it was just no big deal.The only reason that I give D&B two stars is the fact that if you do go there and not eat anything (this may actually save your life!) you could by theory have a decent time.

"540 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"I love Dave and Busters. I think there is nothing more genius than the idea of creating a giant playpen, with food and alcohol for adults. From the giant arcade, to the ticket winning games, to bowling, to pool, to giant plasma screens, you should be able to find something in this place to amuse yourself with. However, if you are coming here purely for the food, well then you have gone horribly awry. Their food runs on the same plane as Friday's or chili's or any other of the same type of chain restaurant, nothing to great, but nothing that should offend you.  I usually go for a burger, which is always the safe bet, and has never really disappointed. As for their drinks, it really depends on the bartender sometimes they are good, sometimes you might as well just have ordered a soda.

"1801 Antioch PikeAntioch, TN 37013",4.5,"Their chicken Panang is the BOMB, I'm not even sure how they manage to get the curry sauce in there to be such a good balance of savory and spicy. Rice is perfectly cooked. Thai tea is WAY too sweet...like Thai tea syrup...I'll order sans the sugar next time, but it still had a great flavor. Boyfriend just got their fried rice (so boring, I thought) well...I thought wrong, they add so many amazing things into this friend rice and the resulting flavor profile is otherworldly.

The soup was just the right amount of spicy and loaded with yummy goodness. The shrimp was firm and added to the dish making it a delicious appetizer.

I had Pad Malaysian w/chicken. It was savory, fresh with just the right amount of heat. Topped off with a Beerlaos lager.....smooth, distinct & perfect match for my dish. Unique location.

"1801 Antioch PikeAntioch, TN 37013",4.5,"Who would've know that a little market would have such a great restaurant inside?! We were in the area & found this place on Yelp! because of the great reviews. You enter the market & make your way to the right of the store. That is where you'll find a little alcove with the restaurant. The hostess stand is the same as the register area, so if there's someone being rung up, just wait behind them to be seated.The dining area isn't that big, I'd say they have about 14 tables maybe. The menu is very straight forward, even if you're not familiar with the cuisine. Each item has an actual picture, not a stock photo from some website. They've also got pictures of the entrees on the wall around the restaurant. Whoever did the photos did a good job too, they're great. They've also got letters & numbers to go with each item if you're not too sure of the pronunciation & don't wanna look like a fool lol. We ordered an order of spring rolls & crab wontons. It didn't take but 5 minutes for us to get them. The spring rolls were good, had a lot of fennel flavor in them. They had shrimp & pork and paired with peanut sauce. I think they were probably pre-made and refrigerated because they were quite chilled. The crab wontons were hot and full of cream cheese and crab, I really enjoyed them and the sweat and sour sauce. The sweet and sour sauce has some heat to it, which I liked.   I've got a bad habit of ordering pad Thai at a new place, I'm not sure if its because I'm trying to be safe or maybe because it's how I compare it to other places. Maybe both. My boyfriend and I decided that we'd each get a different dish and then split them so we could try each others. We got the pad Thai with chicken ($6.50) and we were going to order the Dry Sukiyaki (stir fry vermicelli noodle w/ Napa cabbage, celery, eggs, shrimp, beef, cilantro, green onions and house sauce $7.50) but our server said that we shouldn't get it. Well he didn't say that we shouldn't get it but he said that it was an acquired taste and if we hadn't had it before then we probably shouldn't order it. I like when servers give feedback about dishes, but I don't like when you feel like you cannot make a selection because the server thinks you won't like it. We ordered the pad Malaysian, as a suggestion from our server. I wonder if it has to do with the message at the bottom on the menu that says ""Also know your entree before ordering and will not be refunded after it is placed. Please communicate with your server."" Next time I will order the dry sukiyaki. Our food didn't take but about 15 minutes for it to arrive to the table. Both dishes looked great and I was looking forward to trying both.The pad thai was good, it tasted like a lot that I've had around town before. Our server didn't ask how hot I wanted it, so I take it that it was cooked normal, probably without much heat. The noodles weren't gummy which is good. It had a LOT of onions on it, I'd probably prefer a little less onion. On the pad Malaysian (stir fry flat thick rice noodle in spicy house sauce, eggs, Chinese sausages, spouts, w/ choice of chicken, beef or pork, $8) I really enjoyed the noodles and the little sausage pieces in it. The sausage reminded me of breakfast sausage. If I had to chose between the two, I'd pick the pad Malaysian.Overall I was really impressed with the little restaurants food. The unassuming location has a real gem inside. The staff working here is friendly and attentive.

"1801 Antioch PikeAntioch, TN 37013",4.5,"The best Lao food in the Nashville area. I've roamed around in some of the older menus and found myself hot and cold on King Market for the Thai dishes and the pho. But today, we ordered those items that I know they do very well--Lao. It was truly a Lao (not Thai) meal and freaking spectacular.  I feel fairly safe in saying that no where else in Nashville could you get this meal--this is the real deal and I can't say enough good things about it. Authentic (I grew up on this food and lived in Laos for almost 10 years as an adult). Lovingly made.  I asked for it native hot. It took 2 Lao beers and bogarting my son's Fanta to get me cooled off. Damn. So happy. Our meal:-Sticky rice-Lao sausage (the herb-y, fatty Sai Oua (oo-wa))-Tum mak Tua (asian long beans crushed and dressed a la Som Tum with fresh hot garlic, fish sauce, lime juice, and sugar--I asked for this without pa-daek (native, funky-assed fermented fish that I am too too wussy to enjoy). -Yum pa--essentially fish ""larb"" - delicate, minced cooked tilapia tossed with herbs, finley sliced long beans for crunch and light grassiness and ubiquitous Lao herbs-cilantro, garlic, hom bae (saw toothed ""coriander"") and tossed with fish sauce based dressing. -Deep fried quail. The pillars of a Lao meal are sticky rice, a grilled meat, and a ""salad"" or voluminous amounts of greens, fresh or seasoned with sweet, sour, salty, and bitter flavors. There is a Lao saying about food:  ""sugar is drunkenness; bitterness is medicine"" (vaan pen mao, khomb pen yaa"").  This sets Lao food apart from Thai food. It is homey, not highly processed, very fresh, and masterfully balanced. The Lao are acutely aware of food's medicinal and soulful properties and their preference is to eat family style in big warm groups of friends, families, and honored guests. If you are lucky enough to be invited to a Lao home to eat with them, don't ask any questions, give a nod to divine providence and high yourself there pronto. By the way, don't go empty handed--ever. Take something, anything that the family can eat or drink. I have to put in an extra word for the Lao sausages made and served here.  They are house made, twice cooked--roasted, then sliced and broiled for extra crispness. This is world class fatty herb-y, pork sausage. Pick up some for a lazy Sunday morning at home. Just pop them in under a low broil for 25 minutes. No more handling than that. Throw a baguette in at the end to warm up and voila. Lazy brunch done.  If you are type A, you can slice them and broil them again for extra crispness.On the way out, we grabbed a bag of lam yais (longan or ""dragon eye"" fruit), a box of those crazy looking sea urchin-looking rambutans -- looking fresh and juicy, pumpkin tendrils, baby bak choy, impossibly addictive asian junk food shrimp chips, and premium sticky rice under the brand of three maidens (look for the bag with, uh, 3 women). A tip. The Thai say that eating too much longan can make you hot inside, make your lips hot and itchy, and if eaten with Singha Beer, well, people have been known to explode. I have been flirting with disaster oh these many years and can mow through a pound of this addictive fruit in a quick sitting. Hey, everybody's different. Keep a close watch on your internal temperature. :)Whatever you do, get to King Market and eat their Lao food. It's the dark horse of SE Asian cuisines--next to traditional Khmer food whose greatness has been largely lost to the ravages of the Khmer Rouge and the influx of Thai influences, Lao cuisine is one of the least understood, still very exotic with little known ingredients, but one of the healthiest and best cuisines in SE Asia, IMHO.",King Market,6153333103,81 reviews,2014-12-06,"Franklin, TN",/biz/king-market-antioch,5.0,120,"Nashville, TN",Mary F.

Not like a sausage you're used to.)The hot meter I got medium which is like Sriracha sauce where it hits your mouth but goes away fast.

"1801 Antioch PikeAntioch, TN 37013",4.5,"Returning to Nashville after a trip to Atlanta, I was able to convince my ride to stop and make a long awaited trip to King Market. I'm so glad we did!First of all, the market is extremely clean and organized. But more on that later, to the right of the store is a lovely restaurant with tables and TV's. Note, you need to pay for items separately if you want to shop in the market and get food. Since I was getting take out I did not get pho, but instead ordered the chicken green curry 4/5 spicy and the papaya salad, also 4/5 spicy. Since I bribed my ride to make a pit stop, I also picked up her chicken pad thai and spring rolls. All for a grand total of $22.00. Sweet! The green curry was incredible and a few dollars cheaper than my go-to Thai place at home.  Huge fan of it, and perfect spice level. I'm not sure what happened to the papaya salad, but it was so hot I couldn't eat it. I took a bite and was in pain. I then let my mouth cool off for a while and tried another two bites and was in pain for 10 minutes with ice on my tongue. Eek. On top of it I just didn't love the dish. The flavors (when I could feel my taste buds) were just strange and didn't seem to meld well together. And I love Thai salads. Maybe it just wasn't my cup of tea, but I was disappointed, especially since people were raving about it on Yelp. I threw it away :(The market side was a lot of fun to walk through while waiting for my food.

"1801 Antioch PikeAntioch, TN 37013",4.5,"This place is FANTASTIC. I came here with a coworker based entirely upon what I've read on Yelp, and as usual, Yelp did not lead me astray.They serve food the likes of which is sometimes difficult to find in this part of the country, and it's absolutely delicious. I can't wait to go back! The prices are more than reasonable and the service is friendly as can be.This place is especially great if you love spicy. I don't mean somewhat spicy, I mean SPICY. If you specially ask for spicy in a place like this, the spice level is practically atomic. Of course I did just that. The meal I ate here is the first one in recent memory that was so spicy that I had to stop eating for a moment and reassess if I should continue. It was too tasty to stop though so I continued to nom it down. I must have been visibly in delicious pain because a lady emerged from the kitchen with a pitcher of water and actually left it on my table for me. For the rest of the day, I was actually able to feel the path this food was traversing through my digestive tract. So, if you want to gain acute awareness of exactly how your insides are arranged, ask for really spicy. Otherwise, just go with how it's normally made :)Really though, this place is awesome, and the grocery store that it's attached to is amazing as well. Need a whole squid? Some spicy-crab flavored Lays chips? A durian? Look no further... and seriously, try the crab chips.

"1801 Antioch PikeAntioch, TN 37013",4.5,"Y-U-M. King Market has been on my radar (aka my Yelp bookmark list) for a few years now. A friend recently strongly urged that I go for a meal, so on a random day I went for a late lunch. SO good. I loved the soup I had, tho at this point I can't even remember what was in it. The flat rice noodles seemed homemade - some of them sort of stuck together. It was listed on the menu in some item dishes that the noodles WERE homemade. It seems everything else here at the King Market Cafe as well. Laotian cuisine - so, Southeastern Asia. There is pho and coconut milk curries on the menu, as well as Thai tea and coffee.  The price was great too, as I got a BIG HEARTY BOWL o' noodle soup for under $10.

"1801 Antioch PikeAntioch, TN 37013",4.5,"I haven't yet been shopping in King Market; this review is for the cafe that's in the back. I had heard about this place from several friends, both on and off of Yelp. A friend and I were grabbing lunch and felt like Asian cuisine; neither of us had tried King Market, so off we went. Upon setting foot in the actual cafe, the first thing I noticed is that my friend and I were the only  Caucasians in the joint. We were also the only dining pair that was speaking English. I took both of these as excellent signs. Our waitress, whom I believe was named Nina, was super friendly and attentive. She took our order, and then had our appetizers out in a flash. My buddy got the egg rolls. He said they were the best he'd ever had. I took some recommendations from Jason S. and ordered both the spring rolls and the Kao Soy soup. The spring rolls were easily the best I'd ever had. The soup, well I'd never had it before, so I don't have anything to compare. I will say that I wish I'd ordered it spicier, as I added some Sriracha for heat. The broth was extremely rich and I struggled to finish the huge portion, but since it was SO good, I made myself. To top it all off, both the spring rolls and the enormous Kao Soy came to less than 10 bucks, tax included. As my friend said, it's not quite as good as The Smiling Elephant for Thai food, but it's easily half the price. I won't hesitate to come back, especially since I live so close.",King Market,6153333103,230 reviews,2014-01-22,"Nashville, TN",/biz/king-market-antioch,5.0,120,"Nashville, TN",Charles S.

I then received my other dish I ordered and to my surprise it contained sausage as well. I talked with the manager she apologized and didn't took any money from me.

We came here at least twice a week (we lived only minutes away) they knew what we wanted and what we wanted to drink right when we sat down. We have had almost everything on the menu !

"1801 Antioch PikeAntioch, TN 37013",4.5,"Found this place on Yelp, and are SO happy we did - both for the grocery and the great restaurant.  We've been alternating between K&S and the InterAsian deli for our Asian groceries.  This place is WAY better than both - cleaner and with fresher produce than K&S and larger with more variety than InterAsian deli (although we love that place too).  Also, like the InterAsian deli, they have prepared foods, including banh cuon (hard to find here!), roast duck, fried dough, fried banana, banh bao, banh mi and a few desserts (che).  We also ate at the restaurant.  I wasn't sure if the pho would be good since it's more of a Thai/Laotian place, but I'll try it next time since there were several other Vietnamese customers there and many of them ordered pho so it must be good.  I got thom yum - a spicy/salty/sour seafood soup.  It was delicious - great broth, plenty of seafood (shrimp, large mussels, squid), spicy but not over the top.  It came with rice and cabbage to tone it down.  We also split spring rolls, which were good - typical pork/shrimp mix with a good peanut/hoisin sauce.My wife, on the other hand, didn't have a great experience.  She doesn't like spicy food and asked for the papaya salad ""as mild as possible"".  It was actually spicier than my soup - which I'd requested to be spicy.  I think the problem was that the salad is pre-made and soaking back there in the spicy sauce all day, so even if they don't add extra spices, it comes out pretty saturated in spice.  Either that, or the waiter was trying to punish her  (just kidding).  She got it with seafood, and was at least able to eat that part since it hadn't been soaking - lots of fresh squid and some large shrimp.Service was quick and prices were very reasonable - $21 for spring rolls, my soup and the papaya salad with seafood added.  We will definitely be back!  I almost didn't want to write the review and keep it my little secret, but they deserve whatever extra business they may get.  Check it out!",King Market,6153333103,71 reviews,2013-04-01,"Nashville, TN",/biz/king-market-antioch,5.0,120,"Nashville, TN",Briana P.

"1801 Antioch PikeAntioch, TN 37013",4.5,"I'm just going to lay it all out there.The reason I haven't written a review on this place is that I just didn't want others to find out about it.  I know, I'm a jerk.  But look, this place is a hidden treasure.  Nowhere else in town can you find a place that sates your Asian grocery, jewelry and Lao food needs UNDER ONE ROOF!  That's right folks, King Market DOES IT ALL!I had seen this place pop up in my feed a few times, and especially because of the recommendation of Ryan O., but I had never actually made the trip down there.  Then one day I was down that way visiting So Gong Dong Tofu House, only to find out it was sadly closed that day (on a Wednesday?!?).  Did a quick search and  found out that King Market was right down the road!It's really a cool place.  You walk in, see the Asian market part and off to the right is a full jewelry store - like a mini slightly budget Jared Galleria in there.  And right around the corner from there?  A nook with a bunch of tables and TVs.  As soon as I got there, pretty much every table was packed, but the lady who runs the show, Nina, got me seated right away.I'd say Nina is one of the great parts about going to this place.  She banters in multiple languages with the regulars, she will remember who you are pretty quickly, she can guide you through the menu very well, and she will help you find new foods based on your previous experiences there.  And she is just a sweetheart.  I'd give her a job in a heartbeat.  So, no reason to be afraid there - Nina's got your back.The first thing I got there was the Khao Soi with some spring rolls on the side.  The spring rolls were filled with fresh veggies and a nice soft uncooked wrapper with a yummy dipping sauce. And the Khao Soi... oh that soup.... It was a glorious bowl full of veggies, meat, and rich rich broth.  And when I asked for it extra hot, they gave it to me extra hot!  A nice film of hot oil floated at the top and made every bite that much more magical.  It was really one of those moments where by the end, I was ready to lick the bottom of the bowl - no shame.Oh and the sticky rice - so perfect in texture.  I got the beef larb once, such a cool melange of flavors that I just didn't care about what beef parts they were.  And one day when I was going to repeat an item and Nina steered me to the Chicken Noodle Soup (again, extra spicy to my specifications) and I am convinced that brew could fix anything that is ailing you.  Crap.  Now I can't stop thinking about that soup.  I really need to come up with some new reason to get down there.  This place is vegetarian/vegan-friendly too; my wife has enjoyed the heck out of it so far.So, as much as I want to keep this joint to myself, I have to share it with the rest of the world.  Or install a soup pipeline from Antioch to my part of town.  Or both.",King Market,6153333103,312 reviews,2013-10-14,"Nashville, TN",/biz/king-market-antioch,5.0,120,"Nashville, TN",Jason S.

So my family and I had to try almost everything; almost because we ordered some to go to bring to our hotel.We had the papaya salad the way my wife wanted it, super spicy. The did a great job because it was even too spicy for her, which made her happy. I had the sausage and fried shrimp for appetizer and a very tasty Thai soup. Wow!! It was fresh, great mixture and balance of spices, and very addicting even though the food and sauces had a late heat. Once the heat comes, it is too late... Speaking of the sauces, just could not get enough of it....it was too good. My son also had some other items and it was all awesome and did I say the ""sauce"" is very addicting.The staff treated us like family and again the prices were cheap!!

"1801 Antioch PikeAntioch, TN 37013",4.5,"I've been here many times recently, for both the food at the restaurant and also to buy groceries so I feel like I can give a good picture of what to expect.  The in-store restaurant is the best reason to go there, for good thai/laotian food.  The restaurant is simply decorated and not very large, but the food is what you're going for here mainly, not the atmosphere.  On my first visit I ordered the papaya salad because it had been a long time since I'd had some, and I made the mistake of ordering it hot.  When you order something hot there, they do not patronize you at all, it is HOT.  I could barely eat half of it in fact, but I loved the flavors.  Since then I've been more careful with the heat level and pretty much every dish has been very good, perhaps with the exception of the pho  (after having pho at Kien Giang on Charlotte, every other pho seems to not quite measure up).  Their appetizers are very cheap and well prepared, especially the fresh spring rolls.  I've had the Mee Krob, pad kee mao, yum voon sen, green curry, and the pho, and have been more than happy each time.  Nina, the main waittress/hostess, is very friendly and is good at making suggestions if you are unsure what to try.As a grocery store, it is very clean and offering some surprisingly good deals.  Also it does not smell at all, unlike some other places like K&S, which makes the whole experience better.  Vegetarians may want to note they have a large selection of canned Seitan in various flavors and also some decent-looking tofu in the refrigerated section.  On the way out there is a small area where they sell premade banh mi sandwiches, sesame balls, and a few other treats like fried bananas.  I've tried out the banh mi and the sesame balls, very good, but note the banh mi has pate on it in addition to pork - some people don't like that.All in all, it's definitely worth a try if you are looking for some authentic tasting thai food and aren't looking for a lot of atmosphere.  If you are looking for groceries it's highly recommended for its cleanliness and cheap prices.  One of my favorite places in Nashville.",King Market,6153333103,5 reviews,2013-03-22,"Nashville, TN",/biz/king-market-antioch,5.0,120,"Nashville, TN",Chris S.

"1801 Antioch PikeAntioch, TN 37013",4.5,"Don't let the Thai category fool you, this unassuming market/restaurant is another great Asian choice in a town full of killer Laotian food.  You may be asking what the difference between the two is, and honestly the most I can tell is that Thailand and Laos share a border and a lot of the dishes are interchanged between the two cultures.Laos also shares a border with Vietnam which is why you'll find a variation of Pho on the menu as well.My suggestion would be to start with some of their super fresh spring rolls served with a side of house made peanut sauce and some iced coffee.  This isn't just any ordinary iced coffee, the coffee here is strong and served cold with sweetened condensed milk.The papaya salad is a mainstay in Lao culture, it's usually eaten with some sort of protein and either sticky rice or steamed rice.  I prefer mine native hot, but sometimes i think the spice level is toned just a bit for the noobs.  Once the servers get to know you, get ready for destruction of your face.  Be sure to ask for the sticky rice with your order.  Quick tip, eat the cabbage they provide on the side to cool your palette from the heat, it helps.Another favorite of mine here is the Larb, which is a chopped beef salad cooked any temperature you like.  It's flavored with fish sauce, lime, chills, and various herbs.  The salad is served with a side of lettuce which is meant to be a vessel for the beef sort of like a mini-wrap.I really can't say enough great things about King Market, this place is the real deal home cooked Asian food that's missing at so many Asian restaurants in town.",King Market,6153333103,201 reviews,2011-06-08,"Nashville, TN",/biz/king-market-antioch,5.0,120,"Nashville, TN",Peter K.

"1801 Antioch PikeAntioch, TN 37013",4.5,"For Nashville standards, this is a good Thai/Lao restaurant within its affordable price bracket. It's certainly not the best Thai place in Nashville, but you get great mileage out of your dollar here. I don't think you can find better appetizers and dishes anywhere else at the same price point.However I do find the Vietnamese food here (beef pho in particular) to be a bit overrated. It's a distant 3rd/possibly 4th when comparing to the 'best pho in Nashville' (1st place goes to V&V seafood). It's missing that critical beef flavor that comes from cooking beef marrow all day in the soup. Even though the dish as a whole is rather flavorful, it's not quite delicious. I would make the analogy of fresh real beef broth versus good powdered/pre-made beef broth. The latter still tastes decent, but in pho broth, the marrow is key.That being said, I would not hesitate to come back for just the Thai/Lao food. I've been here numerous times and don't plan to describe the various dishes I've ordered.The little bakery stand near the market cash register has fried taro and sesame balls that I've been unable to find elsewhere in the Greater Nashville area.

"1801 Antioch PikeAntioch, TN 37013",4.5,"PARKING: Parking was nice because this restaurant is within a larger Asian supermarket (= superconvenient, no?).PRICES: Super cheap. Should've taken a picture of the menu but I do recall that pad thai was like $6. Maybe that's standard around there? Definitely not in the Bay!FOOD: I've been trying to build up my tolerance for spicy food and asked for medium spice on the shrimp larb (meat + salad). Little did I know, the spice wasn't the problem- the dish was so incredibly salty! Not so enjoyable. Perhaps it was because the shrimp wasn't fresh shrimp like I had thought, but rather that dried stuff my mom loves putting in soups. The second dish I got was the papaya salad. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING. I had just arrived in Nashville and just wanted to grab a quick dinner and scanned through yelp reviews much too quickly. I just saw the ""papaya salad"" in a few of these recommendations and didn't even see that it was the spiciest thing on earth.

"1801 Antioch PikeAntioch, TN 37013",4.5,"Went here while visiting some friends with the original intention of getting some pho. However, once I got there and found out it was actually a Lao restaurant and not Vietnamese, i got really excited. Not that I don't love Pho but it's become so easy to find lately that it can get a little old. Lao food on the other hand is still a rarity. I only know of one other restaurant in Georgia that specializes in Lao food.And when I say Laos I don't just mean a weak attempt at it. This place is real home cooking, same flavors I've had when visiting the homes of my Lao friends.. I ordered the Laos Fried Sausage, sticky rice, papaya salad, Jaew Bong (or Gel Bong depending on your spelling), and a Thai tea.The sausage was awesome. Bold flavors and great texture. Don't be afraid to try it out if you've never had Lao food. Paired very well with the sticky rice and jaew bong.Jaew bong by the way is a chili paste usually made from fish sauce, chilies, garlic and and a few other ingredients. There's a slight spice to it but I don't think it's anything that the average person couldn't handle.My friend ordered the papaya salad as hot as they make it and for me it was unbearable. The flavors were excellent but the spice was too much for me and I can usually handle a good bit of heat. My face was read and I was sweating after one bite. It took about half my glass of Thai Tea with milk to put the fire partially out.

"1801 Antioch PikeAntioch, TN 37013",4.5,"After numerous return trips to King Market, I had to come back and give this place another star. What I love about this place is that they don't beat around the proverbial bush when it comes to spice levels.  I've been all over Nashville and even though I always ask for my dishes native most come back with comical heat levels at best. Here, when you they ask you on a scale of 1-5, and you say 5, it's more like 27.  I don't know if those other places think us silly white people can't handle it or whatever but you won't have that problem here.The papaya salad here can be prepared so hot it will take your breath away. And not in the Tom Cruise riding a motocycle away from the airport at dusk kind of way. I mean something that surprises your breathing into a timeout kind of way. Yeah, I am not sure what that really means either but it sounded applicable. Maybe I am still high on chili peppers. The last time I was here my friend and I shared what was reported to us as papaya salad but more closely resembled a pile of chili pepper seeds on a plate intermingled with a little salad here and there. Tears were streaming down my face like a little girl who didn't get a pony for Christmas.  My forehead was solid red and food sweats ensued. Three hours later my fingers are still minging from the pepper heat. Pro-tip: Use the chopsticks rather than handling the papaya with the lettuce wedge they bring you. The sticky rice... well, you have more self control than I if you can manage to not attempt eating a bucket of it.  I've yet to try the Pho but I have had a red curry pork noodle soup (Khow poont?) that was better than the best bowl of Pho I've ever experienced. I've been to biggest chinatowns all over North America and I am here to tell you this place is legit. I've still yet to purchase anything from the market but it is fun to just wander around and peruse if nothing else. Don't forget that if you need to bling out your wardrobe they got you covered too.

"1801 Antioch PikeAntioch, TN 37013",4.5,"Where else can you go get groceries, jewelry, and the best Lao-Thai cuisine in the Nashville area!!   King Market may be the best kept secret in the Nashville area when it comes to ""Thai"" style  food. I say ""Thai"" as a general description because the sign outside on their marque clearly says ""Lao-Thai "" and thats what sets this place apart from all the other ""Thai"" places in Nashville. I really don't know what the difference is between Thai and Lao-Thai is? Maybe I'll look it up on wikipedia and regurgitate the definition like some kind of asshole with a smart phone, but I won't. All you need to know is that its fucking fresh, well prepared, moderately priced ($6-$8 for chicken,beef dishes) and extremely fucking yummy ""Lao-Thai"" food. On top of that, the friendly service is beyond description, it may be your first time there but they'll treat you like a regular on your first visit. Nina and her family are awesome!!  The menu has great descriptions and pictures for beginners of the ""usual suspects"" like pad kee mao, pad see ew, pad thai, thai fried rice, pho noodle soups, curries, pad phet etc. Then they have some items that you won't see on most contemporary Thai restaurant menus like fried frog legs and fried intestines!! Get their sweet tea, its like Thai tea minus the condensed milk and just as great.  The grocery market is your normal collection of asian staples, condiments and food items. The produce section is actually above par compared to most chain supermarkets! The kicker has to be the ""To Go"" hot bar, by the far left register. It contains chicken on a stick, spring rolls, crab rangoon, and other assorted fried dough goodness for a very appealing low price. I think I bought a Ban Mi sandwich there a while ago, it wasn't bad.The one thing I have to say is be prepared for some heat!! If you don't request a mild med or hot it will come out native!! I attribute them for helping me lose my sissy tongue! Thx KM!!

We started with spring & egg rolls, the spring rolls were seriously fresh and seriously delicious, the peanut sauce was also really good. Then we just ordered a bunch of shit because it all looked so good and was all so damn cheap.We had papaya salad, which was pretty damn hot, but really awesome especially with sticky rice. We had panaeng chicken, delicious curry spiced and laden with vegetables, I actually wish it was a bit hotter. We also had 2 different types of pad, mine was a bit hotter, and it was freaking delicious. Pad see ew, and I forgot the other one. Had a fresh coconut also, also fucking delicious.All of that food, like 7 or 8 dishes was 35 bucks. 35 bucks for a way better meal than I have had at most places in Nashville that charge that for an entree. The service was great and really friendly, apparently they are haing a papaya competition in April also.

"401 Commerce StNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"This was one of the worst panera experiences I've ever had. We came here after reaching a couple of closed on Sunday restaurants in the area. I've been to many panera locations and I've never had such bad food and service. The lady that took our order was disrespectful and very apathetic. We were not greeted and when we were deciding on food she was on her phone. After hearing us discuss our options she never interfered and mentioned how they were out of bread bowls and sides of bread. (Also, how does panera run out of bread?!). It was very frustrating having her take our order.I got a half Sierra turkey and Caesar salad. The Turkey in the sandwich tasted weird like it was expired, there were about 2 pieces of greens, and 1 piece of onion on there. It was very sloppily made. The salad was even worse and it seemed like they dumped half of a bottle of dressing on there making it inedible. Also I bit into what tasted like frozen chicken.Just go to another panera location.

Location right next to the convention center2. Free Wifi3. A nice outside patioAlthough, one of the major drawbacks is its location, especially during a convention break, as it can get extremely busy.While Panera may not have as many gluten free options as some other places, it's nice that at least they have some. There is no separate GF menu, but if you are unsure, ask for the allergen list at the register. I do like that they took GF allergies serous by noting it on the order and making sure that workers changed their gloves and double checked with me on my order. The one awesome/bad thing about my meal was the sweet tea. Coming from up North, I forgot how sweat Southern sweat tea could be and the amount of sugar it contains.If your looking for some really sweat tea and a decent non-break the bank meal, Panera is a good option.",Panera Bread,6154011171,423 reviews,2014-05-07,"Indianapolis, IN",/biz/panera-bread-nashville-5,3.0,37,"Nashville, TN",Stacy P.

There were plenty of relaxed employees around that might have seen to cleaning up as there were only 7 other people in the place. Ordered a ""power sandwich"" of egg white and turkey sausage. Sandwich was made so hurriedly that it was sliding apart with tomatoes hanging out of the middle but somewhat glued together by cheese. The sausage consisted of about 1 tbsp of crumbled sausage thrown on top of the egg white patty. I asked the manager if that was the appropriate amount of sausage.

"401 Commerce StNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"The people here at this Panera are so busy talking about their baby's mama that they can't get an order right! When I first came in to place my order, there was this girl that kept horsing around with a guy saying: 'Stop trying to pull out my weave Donny!' She was loud and the fat guy she was fooling with bumped into me and another customer and didn't even bother to apologize. No one was up front at first, then this girl that called herself  'Vanilla' came out to take the order and fake hair chic, aka 'Chocolate' kept talking to her so my order was wrong. Then I got to the sandwich station and they told me I picked up the wrong order. They asked for a buzzer, but I didn't get one. Then they told me I'd have to wait a few more minutes. The same guy that was horse playing got mad, saying that ""Some of these customers act like they don't even know what they ordered 2 minutes ago. It's sad how some folk steal just trying to get some extra food. Mmmhmm!""  I just looked at the other guy behind the counter who was laughing.Then a third guy came out and said he'd fix my sandwich, like he already knew what was going on. I think 'Vanilla' told him she messed up at the register. He apologized for the mistake. Then I told him Donny got angry so I didn't want him fixing my sandwich. It seems that he overheard this and said, ""Who me? Aw no, I ain't angry. Naw, man. I don't get angry."" Then he had this deranged grin and kept saying he wasn't angry, in so many words, OVER and OVER again like a crazy person.  So just when I start thinking the guy fixing my sandwich is the only normal person that works here, he too messes up the order.Not once, but twice.Of course, me being the thief they wanted to accuse me of being, I dare not pick up the second sandwich that they screwed up. And THIS guy...boy when I finally did sit down, he was so loud that I couldn't help but overhear about all of his life and lifestyle problems!For one, he had no problem with talking about getting out of jail after his domestic fights with his 'baby mama'. I also learned that he was a special education student, with an obvious stutter, and anger management issues, for which he seeked counseling. (Now if only he could get that counselor for his mental friend who's definitely NOT ANGRY!!)  After this whole ordeal, I think I'm ready to write a ghetto soap opera with a spin on the theme from the movie ""Precious"".When I got ready to leave, I asked the guy that fixed the sandwich if I could speak with a manager. Then he told me that HE was the manager! (No surprise there.) And on that note, I left.Upon leaving downtown that afternoon, I really felt wronged, so I reached into my wallet to fill out the survey at the bottom of the receipt. Then I remembered that those guys had taken my receipt when they got the order wrong. (Supposedly because I wanted an extra sandwich!)

Panera is open every day (even most holidays), keeping a schedule that is convenient for downtown workers, tourists and, most important to me, those of us who live downtown. While many downtown eating establishments seem to be most concerned with catering to state office workers and being open during times when they are very busy, Panera seems to understand that customers value businesses that are there to serve them a tasty meal or a good cup of coffee even during times when they are not especially busy.

If you want gourmet, pay a few extra bucks and travel up the street to five points.  If you want something that's fast, filling, cheap, and unlimited, come to Shoney's.This place is surprisingly well run.  The two times I went it wasn't too busy, and it seems clean and fresh.  I've only had their buffet, so I can't comment on other menu items, but for $7, it's quite a deal.  As a bonus, you don't have to wait around for long to get seated, so it's good if you want to get food in a hurry.  The coffee isn't bad, either.This place is also great for people watching.  The people who dine at Shoney's are an interesting bunch, and because of the location there's a lot of variety.  Lots of cute kids, too.  Overall, a good place to eat if you want to stuff our face with breakfast food and be on your way.",Shoney’s Restaurant-Corporate,6152553021,14 reviews,2011-08-14,"Nashville, TN",/biz/shoneys-restaurant-corporate-nashville-5,4.0,5,"Nashville, TN",Suq M.

"110 Interstate DrNashville, TN 37213",2.0,I have been to this location several times. I also go often at lunch. I had started to get upset with the buffet at lunch because of the same menu everyday. Fried Chicken or bite sized meat loaf was the only meat everyday. Fridays they would have catfish but if you do not get there before 12 it usually all gone and they never make anymore fish. I was very bored with their buffet menu at lunch. Buffets should have a variety. My biggest turn off for this location was when a facebook friend of mine posted a picture of their cantelope on the buffet that had a roach in it. I am so repulsed by this that I will never ever eat there again. The manager I was told was not very helpful about this incident as well.

"1 Terminal DrNashville, TN 37214",2.0,"I visited the spot at the airport because I wanted to get some local BBQ while I was in the area. I was told that Neely's is one of the best but on the expensive side. They weren't lying on both counts but the cost was really far too expensive for the meal. I order the beef brisket sandwich which was good though I've had much better in Texas. The macaroni and cheese was ok as well. The coleslaw was actually the best part of the meal though oddly they give it to you to go in a teensy weensy container of about two spoonfuls.  The cost was ridiculous. I asked for a substitution ( macaroni and cheese instead of french fries) and the cashier told me that it would be ok. However when I looked at my receipt she had charged me extra for the substitution which caused me to end up paying for the most expensive sandwich in the airport. To add insult to injury, she didn't tell me that she was charging me extra plus she didn't give me the French fries either even though I had already paid for them. Had she told me that  the substitution was going to result in me paying for 3 side orders I would have simply ordered a platter which would have cost less.  I made her give me the French fries and left.

"1 Terminal DrNashville, TN 37214",2.0,"I'm always a bit skeptical of airport barbecue, but I needed some food in me before my flight. Neely's is run by Tony Neely, brother of Food Network's Pat Neely, so I hoped this airport location would offer up something at least halfway decent.Granted airport food is always more expensive, but $14.00 plus tax is a bit much for a one-meat plate. Even their sandwiches start at $9.00 each, and a full rack of ribs is $22.00. Hell, just a small thing of cobbler is $6.00. I took the plunge anyway and ordered a Platter of sliced beef brisket, which also comes with three sides. They were somehow out of potato salad, so I settled for mac and cheese, bbq beans, and french fries. Neely's wasn't very busy mid-afternoon, but food still crawled out of the kitchen at a turtle-like pace.The mac and cheese was exceptionally orange and looked really artificial. It reminded me of the macaroni at KFC. The beans had some meat (I'm not sure what kind) mixed in, but I couldn't taste anything other than canned beans. As you might imagine, the fries were nothing special and likely frozen.Much to my dismay, the brisket was drowning in a thick barbecue sauce. It's sadly very common for fast food style barbecue joints to mask bland meats with globs of potent sauce. My razor-thin slices were really lean and dry. I managed to find a few small pieces of un-sauced meat, and it was virtually devoid of all flavor.I certainly wasn't expecting world-class barbecue at the airport by any means, but I expected better than this, especially considering the price. Their slogan is ""The Finest the World Over."" I don't know if the rest of the Neely family can cook good barbecue, but what I do know is that the airport Neely's is absolutely terrible.UPDATE (August 9, 2014): I was mistakenly under the impression that the Nashville airport Neely's Bar-B-Que was owned and operated by Pat and Gina Neely, of Food Network fame. As it turns out, Pat's brother Tony is actually the one who runs the airport Neely's.

"1 Terminal DrNashville, TN 37214",2.0,"I've enjoyed watching Pat and Gina Neely on the Food Network, so I wanted to try their BBQ when I was visiting Tennessee.  Unfortunately, we never made it to one of their restaurants in Nashville or Memphis, so my last chance was at the Nashville airport.  I remembered seeing it there when I arrived the week before so I knew it was an option.  We got to the airport early to allow time for lunch at Neely's in the airport.  I was disappointed to find out that it was only a fast food/take-out restaurant and not a dine-in one.  We ordered two BBQ pork sandwiches to go.  It took longer than normal ""fast food"" to prepare.  I think we waited about 10 minutes after ordering.  That would be okay for a sit-down restaurant, but if our only option is take-out, then it should be faster.  Luckily, there wasn't a long line, otherwise the place wouldn't have been able to accommodate.  I don't think there was enough staff on that Saturday afternoon anyway.  After waiting, our next assignment was to find a place to sit and eat.  This turned out to be a difficult challenge.  The small food court tables a terminal away were full, so we turned back to our gate and took a seat there.  Do you know how hard it is to try to eat messy BBQ sandwiches out of a box on your lap?  At any rate, the BBQ sandwich tasted good (although probably not near as good as ""fresh-made"" at one of their sit-down restaurants), and there was plenty of Neely's BBQ sauce on it.  The French fries were once very good and different, I think, but now they tasted old (and cold).  My partner ordered baked beans instead of French fries, and that was the better option.  They were hot, barbeque-y, and even had more meat cooked right in.  Our sandwiches also came with small containers of coleslaw.  Normally, I do not like or eat coleslaw, but this one was yellowish in color and had a kick!  (No surprise that it's probably Pat Neely's recipe.  He likes his food spicy, just like me.)  I actually enjoyed it; it had a unique flavor (curry?) in addition to the heat.  Would I eat at Neely's Bar-B-Que again?  You betcha...but not at the airport.  They don't do the Neelys justice.",Neely’s Bar-B-Que,,531 reviews,2012-06-04,"Charlotte, NC",/biz/neelys-bar-b-que-nashville,3.0,25,"Nashville, TN",Eric K.

Other peeve, chicken wasn't cooked to order, but rather pre-made, they didn't offer me peppers and onions like the people in front of me (no thanks, didn't want any) and I had to keep asking for extra taboui multiple times.  Lastly, the chicken was dry and flavorless. I will say, their tabouli salad was really good and their cucumber sauce was nice and thick, which I prefer for dipping.

"184 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",2.5,"This happened a few months ago & the incident came up in conversation today, so I thought I'd toss a review out.First, one must understand that I live most every single day in yoga pants (well, Thai fishing pants). These are my working clothes, plus they are comfortable as can.be for all around purposes. I qualify my review with this because it is necessary to understand that I do not own any normal.clothes...no khakis, denim..only Thai pants & cargo shorts.So, me looking a bit bummish (whatever that means) & my buddy head over to Hooters on 2nd avenue. Mostly because he loves looking at hooters and I enjoy hot wings from time to time.We enter the front door to find a group of Hooters girls standing together right at the front... They did not appear to be doing anything especially important... Playing with their respective ponytails, chewing gum, rolling their eyes etc... So we stood there for around 2 to 3 minutes just kind of looking at each other... And then we begin to look at each other in complete shock when we realized that we were never going to be greeted at all, acknowledged in any form or fashion... Did not happen... While I would like to post a review about how good the hot wings were... Or how cold the beer was... I cannot post any of that because I never got past the front door... So after a couple of minutes of being completely ignored by a group of four or five servers... We just simply turned around and left... Will not try this establishment again, for sure...I mentioned my super casual dress earlier in this review because I cannot help but wonder if we were not ignored because of the way we were dressed... We were not downtown business men in suits nor did we have on khakis and a polo shirt... Just two buddies out bumming around in complete casual clothing...

"184 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",2.5,"Service was good and food tasted okay; however, we ordered a Buffalo Platter, which we have ordered countless times. It comes with chicken strips. It has ALWAYS come with chicken strips. The menu at this location STILL says it comes with chicken strips. But they put boneless wings on there instead, then sent the server back to argue about it when we mentioned the change. She's pointing to the menu saying ""see where it says chicken strips? They changed that to boneless wings."" Um, we were supposed to know this how? Especially considering the same thing was ordered a couple weeks ago in Knoxville, and it came with the damn chicken strips. And I was more annoyed that the kitchen and/or manager put the server up to coming over and arguing and belaboring the issue instead of making it right and delivering the items that are on the menu.  At one point she offered to get the manager, but I guess they decided to give us the damn chicken strips because he/she never showed up, and chicken strips did. Unacceptable. Silly. Idiotic.  But what else should I expect from a chain location that probably only survives due to it being located on a tourist trap street? I had heard that Hooters was planning a major overhaul to its brand. I would have thought it would include uniforms that aren't off an 80's basketball court and a total remodel of the restaurant interiors - not substituting cheaper items on the menu without notice and sending your poor servers to defend it.Here, let me just wrap it up by saying ""chicken strips"" a few more times.

I have been to hooters all over the country and usually enjoy myself but....my brother and i are on a road trip and just wanted a quick drink or two and some food while we caught the end of the football game. it took about ten minutes before anyone came over to greet us, and that would be our server brooke. she seemed super nice and bubbly, maybe she just got caught up and distracted before noticing us. thats cool, we're both servers, we get it. but alas, after we ordered our drinks (corona and vodka/soda and a water) we waited a LONG time to get any drinks. A LONG TIME. like 8 minutes in the football game time. including a touchdown, 2 timeouts, and a couple commercials. soooo at least another 10-15 min.  I am watching her spend all her time with the tables of single guys.great, theyre your money makers. again, i get it. but at least check on us!!!! or bring us water. or send another server to help. something.at this point i am getting grumpy, but we got our drinks and settled in to watch the game. the food took a little longer than would be expected for a medium cooked nacho burger and 10 boneless wings but whatever, not too big a deal. except that the burger was overcooked. on the level of well done. after waiting a while for brooke to check on us, i finally just starting eating because i was very hungry. While eating my overcooked burger, brooke is nowhere to be seen. very ghostlike. twenty minutes after getting our food (delivered by a runner, so AT LEAST a half hour since we've seen her), she finally checks on us. I let her know that the burger was over cooked and she promptly sent the manager over.dude, i wish i had gotten your name, you were great. he offered us free dessert since by this time i had already almost finished my burger. he was extremely apologetic and seemed sincerely concerned. we said that would be awesome. again, brooke disappears. is she mad we complained about the burger? she wont even make eye contact anymore!!after we clear off our plates and we stack all our dishing at the end of the table, we wait again. finally brooke swoops by and says 'want your slip?' in passing. wasnt even sure she was talking to us. she never mentioned dessert and we were over trying to salvage the evening. after running my card, brooke slapped, and i mean slapped, the receipts down. no thank you. no have a nice night. seriously.the food was overpriced for the quality but thats hooters in general. boneless wings nowhere near as good as their bone in wings (which are pretty delicious), but i highly recommend the nacho burger. the flavors were spot on. just wish it were cooked properly.so overall, great manager. super nice food runner. very nice cute little blonde who acknowledged us as we were leaving.

This may sound snobby but as a fairly seasoned business traveler, I know better not to risk it but I went against better judgement and it was..regrettable. You see, United airlines delayed my flight 4 hours (no joke) and after 3 hours, I was famished. In desperation and serious hunger, I broke down and ordered the enchiladas with green sauce. I was so hungry, it did not taste good but I ate it anyway. The processed melted cheese on top was the kicker, why did i continue to eat? I don't know. Should have know better. And the result? Well, look - in the age of revenge yelping and having worked in restaurants, I prefer not to shame a place by saying they made me sick.

How do I know the enchiladas made me ill? About two hours after consuming the meal, I felt nausea and can only conclude it came from this place. While it is entirely possible that it was a coincidence the illness set in after the meal, the more likely scenario is it was due the restaurant.",La Hacienda,,12 reviews,2015-05-02,"Chicago, IL",/biz/la-hacienda-nashville,1.0,17,"Nashville, TN",Dan S.

"1 Terminal DrNashville, TN 37214",2.5,"I've spent quite a bit of time at BNA, and I'd much rather bypass the ""food court"" at the junction of the A & B concourses and head down the A concourse to La Hacienda.  The food is not the tex-mex I am used to, but it is flavorful and pretty darn good for airport food.  The margaritas are super tasty.  I'm also partial to the tortilla soup.  Stopped in for breakfast before an early flight the other day and the breakfast quesadilla was yummy too (I dug out the filling and left most of the tortilla, but that's my normal weirdness).  They will even give you a to-go cup full of water if you'd like, which is very nice.  The staff have always been stellar - helpful, friendly, and quick.  Bonus is this is also close to my gate.",La Hacienda,,432 reviews,2012-08-17,"Highlands Ranch, CO",/biz/la-hacienda-nashville,4.0,17,"Nashville, TN",Erin H.
"1 Terminal DrNashville, TN 37214",2.5,"For an airport, this place surprisingly has good food and good service. A gold margarita on the rocks (no frozen drinks available), a plate of two beef enchiladas, and a bottle of water cost about $25 (including tip and tax). The enchiladas had a sauce over them that seemed to have a bit of a kick, which I liked. The rice and beans tasted just as expected.Presentation could be better.

Service is regularly undependable and the food quality. I have had a side dish forgotten, another time a woman assisted before me despite waiting for several minutes prior to the woman coming, and I waited about 17 minutes when the order was supposed to be ready 10 minutes before.  So about half another late - not good service.  Another time, I called in and they didn't send my order to the cooks so was stuck waiting.  Why call in? And the price is high relative to quality and service. However, the women are nice. And a cute tall girl works at the front which makes the wait a little more bearable. The food can be fresh and tasty, and at times you might be able to even have a smooth service experience.

"1 Terminal DrNashville, TN 37214",2.5,"I recently ate at La Hacienda at the Nashville aiport. I very specifically tipped exactly 15%, because my company has a policy that that is the maximum tip amount on our corporate cards. My waitress was named Senait. Someone took the liberty of rounding my tip amount of $3.29 up to $4.00. Although the amount is minimal, I am disgusted that someone felt entitled to steal from me. Not only does this create a discrepancy between my corporate account and my receipt, but it puts me over my 15% tip limit and will cause me some hassle to pay the difference from my own pocket. Besides, the service was very poor and I felt that 15% was generous.

Overall I found it to be average. The experience might have been slightly better for me if the table had not been literally too small for the my Fajita orders. That and apparently the soda refills are not free. When a waitress shows up at your table WITH a soda and asks you if you want another, to me that feels like they are providing you with a free refill. The bill reflected TWO sodas and my girlfriend was drinking water so I can only assume it was my second that was charged. The Fajitas were flavorful so I have no complaints about the food. The service was a bit spotty though. An unfortunate language barrier seemed to exist between the table and the waitress. Neither of us understood most of what she said which made me even more unwilling to even try and discuss the extra soda charge.

When seated we were greeted with complimentary bottomless chips and salsa, which was a pleasant surprise. And this wasn't store-bought salsa and bagged chips; these were homemade.

This is my first time at a Cracker Barrel, and although I was skeptical about it, I was won over by the time I left.The storefront is really cool! They have everything from headache balm, to clothes, quilts, vintage candies and sodas, and candles. It reminds me of the old general stores, so I guess they nailed the concept. This location had rockers out in the front for people to chill out on, and you could buy them if you chose to. The breakfast menu has something like, ""It's never too late for the most important meal of the day"" to which I was definitely like ""Amen."" I got the Old Timer's Breakfast, which included: Two eggs, Grits, Sawmill Gravy, Two Homemade Buttermilk Biscuits, Hashbrown Casserole, and Bacon. Bacon was good (Nothing beats the sugar cured bacon at Clinton Street Baking Company in NYC), but I wasn't too fond of the grits (it was bland), nor the gravy. HOWEVER,The biscuits are so, so, so, so, soooooooooo good. Make sure to request the apple butter, smother it on your biscuit, and revel in the taste of delicious, butter, warm-in-your-tum comfort. Oh my gosh, I wish I could just order 5 bajillion biscuits and a tub of apple butter. The hashbrown casserole was okay (kinda cheesy).

"6941 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"This place is a testament to chain restaurant's ability to clone an experience and reproduce it again and again and again. I start to wonder if they are cloning the service staff as well....But it is exactly what you would expect from a Cracker barrel. Cheap but good country style breakfast food. Eggs are generally cooked well but lack much seasoning, and that is pretty much the same story for all of their food. I can guarantee if you get any of their breakfast platters or sampler's you will walk away full for about $10 or less. Great early morning food when you need a filling breakfast and don't want to cook. Watch out though, these places tend to be packed so you might have to wait around a bit for a seat.

"8016 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37221",3.5,"Overall, Tokyo is a run of the mill Japanese steakhouse. You have the typical teppanyaki show (onion volcano, shrimp tail in the hat, spinning the egg) that you have at any of the others. The family always has a good time when we go.The main positive is the food is decent and nicely priced. Many of the japanese steakhouses are so expensive in comparison. They also have a lunch menu on weekends, which makes it a nice place to go after church on Sundays.I see a lot of reviews on the sushi. My two cents. It is a mile from my house and the sushi is good. So you can grade what this means, I never buy supermarket sushi, as it is gross. The rice is made fresh (a necessity for good sushi) and the fish is good. I think Tokyo Japanese Cuisine (on highway 70 near Starbucks) has better sushi, but they are a place where most people go for sushi rather than the cooked items, so I would expect this. If you have a mixed bag, or want something with close proximity, you will like the sushi at Tokyo.

"8016 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37221",3.5,Absolutely disappointed. We had the craving for hibachi and didn't want to drive all the way into town to eat at one of our regular places. our party was me and my wife and 2 kids we sat with another dad and his 2 daughters. So we all order a variety of things off the menu. The chef starts cooking and the other dad asks where the shrimp appetizer is chef said they don't do that anymore. salads were fair soup was fair so bring on the dinner. Well at best it was fair as well. I asked for hot sauce and it took 3 people to find some for me. Like I said we had a variety of different menu items the kids had chicken I had steak and shrimp wife had steak. The food was just fair not anywhere near as good as the other places we go to. I would not recommend this place anymore. We use to go more often when we lived closer and it was always better. It has gone downhill. I talked to a friend that said he went a few days after us and his review was the same poor food for the price you pay he said he wouldn't go back either. If you are looking for hibachi then drive on into town and eat at one of the other better places.,Kyoto Japanese Restaurant,6156623829,16 reviews,2014-11-05,"Kingston Springs, TN",/biz/kyoto-japanese-restaurant-nashville,1.0,35,"Nashville, TN",Dude S.

"8016 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37221",3.5,"Hibachi Grill was fun!I love the whole Japanese hibachi experience.  The chef was awesomely entertaining.  We had the spicy tuna roll while we were waiting for our table to fill up.  I ordered the filet hibachi meal.  It comes with soup, salad, two shrimp, fried rice, veggies, and filet.  The food was very good.The service needs some improvement.  We couldn't help over hearing the commotion at the grill next to us when we were first seated.  The waitress had everyone's check messed up.  She got it straight after about three tries.  I ordered a glass of wine and after 15 minutes when I finished my soup and salad I stopped our waitress and asked if it was on its way.  I'm pretty sure she forgot it but it finally arrived before the chef got started.  There was a couple at our table that just wanted fried rice and sushi.  When they ordered the waitress acted as if it was ridiculous for them to be at the grill instead of at a table.  They were paying customers so I didn't understand why they couldn't sit where they wanted.  Even if she had a problem with it she could have hid it better.  The sushi they ordered with their rice probably cost more than the hibachi meal so I wouldn't think that was the issue.  I was sad when my wine glass was empty and stayed empty for awhile but then I was saved by a nice woman passing our table.  She noticed and asked if I wanted another and I said yes please.  It came right out.  I wish she would have waited on us.",Kyoto Japanese Restaurant,6156623829,380 reviews,2013-01-27,"Centerville, TN",/biz/kyoto-japanese-restaurant-nashville,3.0,35,"Nashville, TN",Terri H.

It was a little hard to find due to its location in a strip mall (Thanks Yelpers for the heads up!). The interior design didn't knock my socks off, but gotta say, I'm not there for the decor! So let's get to the sushi...We ordered a few maki rolls and plenty of their nigiri. First, I was happy to see when the waitress brought our food that the spicy tuna is done juuuust the way I like it. Mashed tuna with spices in it (not plain tuna with the mayo on top). The fillings tasted fresh and the rice was cooked and seasoned well. The amount of rice on the sushi seemed right too...enough to help fill you up without being waaay too much like some places. Most notable to me was the nigiri. The fish slices were huge! Very generous portions with competitive prices. And once again, fresh tasting.We didn't have any hibachi or appetizers, so I can't speak for the hot food, but the sushi was more than acceptable for me. The servers were very nice, but as some of the other reviewers mentioned, I wouldn't go if I was in a hurry. They weren't super slow or anything while we were there, but it wasn't fast.

"2534 Powell AveNashville, TN 37204",3.0,My rating of four stars is merited because the food is very consistent in my opinion.  One area that remains in constant flux is the front counter service times.  One day it will be great and the next day it seems as if there's a great deal of confusion and the ordering process slows to a crawl.   This morning was a perfect example of the disorderly process when it came to taking orders and filling orders.   Six people were waiting  in line to order and they had three registers open.  Sadly the staff had lots of issues.  Orders had to be repeated several times to the staff filling the orders. It appeared to me as if they were very disorganized which is not the norm. Morning patrons need quick service and good execution of their orders because in most cases they are there way to work.  I'm confident that Panera will do their best to address the slow service issue because they care about quality and customer service. The bottom line is that this location has to make MAJOR improvements in their service execution.,Panera Bread,6152925115,2 reviews,2014-01-31,"Nashville, TN",/biz/panera-bread-nashville-6,4.0,31,"Nashville, TN",Pete P.
"2534 Powell AveNashville, TN 37204",3.0,"Do not come here if you are in a hurry or desperately need your morning coffee....all out and long lines :(For whatever reason, this Panera sucks. Straight up. I switched my breakfast location on a Friday as I was in the 100 Oaks Area. Now, I will preface this review by sharing that I consider myself a Panera connoisseur so you should take the recommendation as gospel. The one or two open registers move with a snails pace. I am not sure if they don't have enough employees to constantly be brewing some coffee but the turnaround just plain bad. I was hoping this was just a breakfast phenomenon but in fact, this Panera couldn't even redeem itself during lunch on a Sunday. I wholeheartedly realize that the breakfast sandwiches and often the panini's are pre-made but that is no excuse. It matters, at least to me, whether the egg, bacon and cheese sandwich was assembled correctly and with love. I don't want to have to destruct and reconstruct my sandwich when it arrives. That is your job. And I paid you to do that. So do it right. And stay on the ball and prepare to replace the coffee when it runs out!

I payed 20 dollars for a microwaved grilled cheese that was was awful and insulting to my taste buds and the soup lacked seasoning and tasted more like chicken and noodles in water.

The inside is large and comfortable and serene !!! Another plus !!!I usually get the bagel and cream cheese for breakfast but this time the lady made a suggestion for a sandwich with Turkey and sundried tomatoes with egg and cheese on a roll squished together and grilled like a panini sandwich..she highly recommended it ...so I said ""sure why not"" sounds good and healthy..since I am always dieting...but UGH!!!! Not a great combination..the sun dried tomato was glumped in the middle and nasty tasting and I usually like sun dried tomatoes..it needs some greens like spinach to add some color and more healthy...the guys that were making it was so busy talking about their conquest the night before and sort of burned the sandwich..that's what i get for trying something out of the box !!!I would not order it again!! I will go back to my standards!!!I will try this location again, because I like the size and decor inside.One other thing I am upset about, i spend a lot of money each time I eat here and I never seem to be gaining any free or discounted products with my panera card...it is suppose to be for loyalty...but I don't seem to be getting too much ""punch""  for my dollars...where are my loyalty gifts?",Panera Bread,6152925115,781 reviews,2013-04-10,"Nashville, TN",/biz/panera-bread-nashville-6,3.0,31,"Nashville, TN",Melissa B.

My mainstay is always the Asiago breakfast sandwich, topped with egg, cheese and bacon on an Asiago bagel. Both hearty and filling, this power-punch for breakfast always gets me going on my way. Generally, I'll add an iced chai tea latte, and they always make this to perfection. I have tried the breakfast quiches in the past.

"2534 Powell AveNashville, TN 37204",3.0,"I needed to meet a friend to discuss helping him with his online business. My requirements where 1) location and 2) wifi. This panera was directly in between the two of us so I went for it. In hindsight it was not a very good decision.I realize that Panera Bread is not exactly the cadillac of cafes. What they are however, is a chain, and if there is one thing I expect from a chain, it is consistency.  So how does this Panera rate against others I have visited? Pretty poorly. At 7pm on a Sunday you would expect things to be rather slow at a coffee shop. And by slow I mean the amount of customers, not the amount of time you spend waiting in line due to slow service. There weren't many people at all in the cafe but I think total time between when I walked in and when I got my drink was upwards of 20 minutes. Moving on to the wifi... I could have transcribed the data into morse code and transmitted it over telegraph line more quickly than the wifi here delivered it. And that was when it worked. It routinely timed out, gave DNS errors, or some other random error that did not accurately reflect the state of your internet destination.  It goes without saying this makes a ""business meeting"" quite difficult.

"2534 Powell AveNashville, TN 37204",3.0,"Even though you can make a sandwich, salad, or bowl of soup at home, sometimes it's nice to enjoy something a little more artisan and made for you without having to lift a finger. That's when I go to Panera.I most frequently will go to the location at Hundred Oaks for breakfast since I am most likely over that way running errands on a Saturday morning. I have tried their baked egg souffles and the spinach and bacon one is fantastic. Even though I can sometimes convince my conscience that the spinach cancels out the naughtiness, these are probably not the healthiest choice there, so these are an occasional treat. I will typically opt for the Breakfast Power Sandwich, which consists of an all-natural egg, a thick slice of Vermont white cheddar and smoked, lean ham all grilled on freshly baked whole grain bread. This sandwich is good as-is, but ask for a little of their sun-dried tomato ale mustard to give it a little extra zip. Just yesterday I tried their new Ham & Gruyere sandwich, which has smoked lean ham, egg, Gruyere & Vermont white cheddar cheese with sun-dried tomato ale mustard, grilled on a soft roll. While the combination of flavors on this sandwich is perfect together, the soft roll is a missed opportunity for a restaurant built on their delicious breads. It is too plain and offers nothing special to the flavor of sandwich.  I am also a big coffee drinker and will almost always go for the darker roasts anywhere I go, however, their dark roast is too thick for even me. I actually prefer their lighter roast after trying both varieties. Yesterday, I went with a cappuccino and it was well done-with a perfect balance of espresso, milk, and froth. Very nice for a change from the regular cup of Joe I usually prefer.

The service overall was just ok. Our server was way too busy to continuously check on our table.  Throughout the service, we would have to flag them down in order to get what we needed. Maybe more wait staff?For lunch, we started with the Stellina Di Notte Pinot Grigio for $9 a glass. The pour was good for the price. The pinot was light, crisp and actually a good wine. We also got the Salmon BLT for $14.99. Grilled salmon, sliced tomatoes, green leaf lettuce, smoked bacon, garlic aioli on a buttered sourdough, served with fries. I thought the BLT was alright. the salmon was cooked good, the bacon, lettuce and tomato made the dish and brought a nice texture. I thought they drenched it with the garlic aioli though. The flavor was good, but a little too much. Fries were just average. If you're at the airport and waiting for a flight, this place should suffice.

Yes, they are very fancy but does that have something to do with why I'm paying $12 to practice yoga relaxation techniques because I'm watching people who ordered after I did nearly finish their meals before I even received my lettuce and mini plastic utensils?I realize that there are more efficient ways to use our petroleum resources, but there are much better utensil options that actually have some substance and are even biodegradable.

I'll try Gibson Cafe again next time I roll through, but will propbably give the nachos or the buffalo chicken sandwich a try (hold the lettuce).",Gibson Cafe,,242 reviews,2014-04-24,"Philadelphia, PA",/biz/gibson-cafe-nashville,2.0,58,"Nashville, TN",Kevin R.
"1 Terminal DrNashville, TN 37214",2.5,Had a layover in Nashville had 2 hours to kill and decided to check out the Gibson cafe. Great music in the restaurant. Nice gibson guitars displayed on the walls. The food was traditional american with a southern styled flare. Very very good. The draft beer was ice cold on tap. Short waiting time for our order.

"1 Terminal DrNashville, TN 37214",2.5,"You know, for an airport restaurant and bar, this one has consistently impressed me after a couple of visits. I fly Southwest almost exclusively, and my flights somehow are always at the VERY end of terminal C, and Gibson Cafe is right there to give you a drink and some food while you wait. You can complain about price, but it's the airport, and all the prices will be high no matter where you go. I get angry when I pay exorbitant prices and the food is bad. At the Gibson Cafe you pay around $12 for a sandwich, and dare I say it, the sandwiches I've had have been GOOD. Yeah, I know. What a concept?? Usually airport food is cold/heat lamp junk that doesn't taste good. But I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich from the Gibson Cafe and it tasted good. As in, I ate every last bite and was surprised by how much I liked it. The fries were hot and fresh, and they gave me speedy service to ensure I got to my gate on time.Also, if you buy a beer, they will give you a shot of liquor for only $4.00 more. And for  wine drinkers, you can get a sidecar for $4.00 extra. Great way to start a vacation!!!Plus if you like music/guitars, it's fun to take a look at the info and pictures on the wall and check out the guitars hanging behind the bar!Nicely done Gibson Cafe, I'll see you again before my next trip!",Gibson Cafe,,484 reviews,2012-12-17,"Nashville, TN",/biz/gibson-cafe-nashville,4.0,58,"Nashville, TN",Sheena T.

They had a menu with sandwiches and salads and such. I didn't get any food though, I was only here for a drink.

"1 Terminal DrNashville, TN 37214",2.5,"This place looked hopeful, during a short layover on a trip to Las Vegas. Very limited menu but I found a delicious chicken sandwich with bacon featured, and opted for a side salad versus seasoned french fries (hey...I'm trying). Seemed promising, you'd think....The food actually was good. It took quite awhile to arrive, and being the rather picky eater I am I asked for no tomatoes on my salad, and no honey mustard on my sandwich. Unfortunately, either the server failed to share this with the kitchen, or they just didn't care because both arrived at my table. This normally wouldn't have ticked me off too much (well, actually it probably would've; listen, people) but I heard two other tables have issues with their orders. Apparently the server has hearing issues.I mean, if forced to go here again if ever in the Nashville airport (I hope neither has to happen in my lifetime), I'd eat here.

Yes, it's an airport restaurant, but the mentality that ""our customers don't have a choice so let's have terrible food and over charge"" is an awful way to run a business. Chicken was frozen. Wings were not cooked to order (sauce had congealed). Guacamole was heavily diluted with lime juice so much so that it was akin to sour patch kids. They didn't even microwave the nachos long enough to melt the cheese. I sound real bitchy but this place was horrible.

The interior of the restaurant has that ( of course being its called Gibson) the very rocker ambiance with electric guitars mounted on the walls,signed records, kind of like an understated, mild version of the Hard Rock restaurant.They have an average selection of american food options to choose from. I decided to go for a protein style burger with swiss cheese. It comes with your choice of side being either french Fry's, onion rings, salad  veggies. I chose the  veggies.It seemed to take for ever to get my lunch and it of course arrived looking like a slightly below average chain style restaurant dish. The burger was ok, certainly not the best quality of meat ( which I wasn't really expecting from this place) and the steamed veggies were carelessly cooked and lacked in any sort of delightful taste.My server also was vacant for the most part and not as friendly comparred to other service encounters on my trip.Overall, the best thing this place has going is the atmoshere everything else is just ok.",Gibson Cafe,,884 reviews,2012-07-30,"Clayton, CA",/biz/gibson-cafe-nashville,2.0,58,"Nashville, TN",Shannon F.

Nothing was terrible it just lacked a few touches that would bring this place from a C- to a solid B+. Ordered the spin dip to start. Accompanying chips tasted stale and burnt. ""Silverware"" was plastic utensils wrapped in a napkin. Table hadn't been cleaned from the previous guest. Got the mushroom Swiss burger. (Wasn't asked how I wanted it cooked, came out medium well). The burger was good enough but about half the size you'd expect from a bar and grill type place. Was more the size of a double cheeseburger from McDonalds. Like I said, not horrible but when you factor in what you're paying ($11.99 and up) you get the impression that most of their clientele is too well serviced at the bar to notice the lack of food quality.

"5511 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"I'll start by saying that I'm not really a huge fan of Mexican food... in fact, I went on a mission trip to Mexico for a week and a half and disliked the food so much that I kind of starved myself.  finicky? yes!  Anyway, my parents came to visit me from out of town and this was literally the only sit down place that was open this late in West Nashville.  I was kind of reluctant to go, but my parents kind of dragged me in (they are a bit more adventurous than I am).  At first look, the place seemed a bit sketchy (not gonna lie... I was scared), but I've come to realize that this place is really a hidden gem.  The staff there are really friendly and they try to encourage you to speak Spanish (which can be amusing when my dad tries to prove his skills).  The prices are really good and the atmosphere is that of a local pub (do we have that in Nashville??) ... its just a comfortable place I would go to take my girlfriends for a few drinks and to hang out and yet at the same time it would be comfortable enough for a family with young children to come.  And the food was so tasty.  The salsa is great on their homemade chips!  And I ate everything on my plate, which was HUGE.  The steak fajitas with onions, peppers, and guacamole was so good. mmmm. I'm craving it right now :PSome side notes, apparently the salsa can be made super spicy, so for spice enthusiasts, like my brother, this is definitely something to look forward to.  Also, while some people have complained about the slow service, I'd have to say that when I went, they were very attentive...",Las Palmas Mexican Restaurant,6153520313,776 reviews,2012-01-05,"Nashville, TN",/biz/las-palmas-mexican-restaurant-nashville,5.0,26,"Nashville, TN",Alex P.

"5511 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, but the stars aligned properly on the night I visited the West Nashville Las Palmas.  From the chips and salsa to the fried ice cream, I enjoyed everything about this meal.Mexican restaurants and (what we're exposed to of) Mexican food are two things that I don't think could get much more boring.  Like the majority of Chinese takeout places, it seems as if they all get their menu from a central clearinghouse...with the combination platters that always seem to be missing the one item you really want...I'm not saying this was the most exciting dinner I've ever had, but it was easily the highest quality and most delicious Mexican food I've had in as far back as I am able to keep record of these things...I appreciated that, while most of Las Palmas' menu did seem to come from the ""central clearinghouse"", there were a few diversions.  One that stuck out to me was the Parrillada (translated 'barbeque' in Spanish).  Available on the menu 'for one' or 'for two', my 'for one' portion could easily have fed two people.  It contained grilled and seasoned shrimp, chorizo, ribeye, chicken, and pork tenderloin -- along with peppers and onions -- and beans/rice/sour cream/guacamole on the side.  At $13.50 (for one) it is the most expensive entree on the menu...but it was worth it.  I was most impressed with the chorizo.  I love chorizo sausage...but it is often greasy and overcooked into little bits.  The chorizo on this plate came in large chunks, about half the size of an average-sized meatball.  It was flavorful and not greasy at all (goes great with shrimp!)[Speaking of grease, the lady at the table next to me had a bottle of blue Parkay squirt butter at her table (presumably she didn't carry it in her purse -- it was still there when she left).  If anyone can tell me what she possibly could have been doing with it, please let me know.  I have pondered on it for far too many hours already.]The drinks were large (and strong) for the money, and as always you get all the chips and salsa you can shake a maraca at!  I decided to top off this extravagant (for Mexican) meal with some fried ice cream.  How can one go wrong?  It's still only a once-every-six-weeks-AT-BEST kind of place for me, but I'll be back!",Las Palmas Mexican Restaurant,6153520313,32 reviews,2008-04-03,"Orlando, FL",/biz/las-palmas-mexican-restaurant-nashville,4.0,26,"Nashville, TN",Adam M.

"5511 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"This place hit the spot for a Mexican craving.  Service was pretty good even with several large groups in the area. - First thing to consider:  chips and salsa. The salsa was thick and heavy, too much tomato flavor and too little other flavors, almost like ketchup, but easily edible.  The chips were fine.- Second consideration:  margaritas.  We were warned not to go for the regular margaritas so we went for top shelf and they were very good.  Will get them again. - Third critical item for us:  cheese dip.  We really went for cheese dip and drinks and tried both the bean dip and cheese dip.  The bean dip came in a large bowl/plate with some cheese in it.  It was very good especially if you want mostly beans.  The cheese dip was a small bowl with just good cheese.  It hit the spot was but so small, especially compared to the bean dip.  With both being under $3, no serious complaints here.  We did pay for two sides of jalapenos which helped make both dips better. I would like to see the offer of a few free tortillas come with cheese dip.- Final key area:  menu and food.  The menu looked solid, offering many options for vegetarians who wanted more than just beans or cheese as fillings. After sharing two dips, we only had room to try a side of enchiladas.  We thought they were fine and liked the option of buying a la carte.   All in all, even though I wasn't pleased with the salsa, this was a solid Mexican chain that will hit the spot for a fast fix any day.  Just stick with top shelf if you want margaritas.",Las Palmas Mexican Restaurant,6153520313,44 reviews,2012-01-08,"Nashville, TN",/biz/las-palmas-mexican-restaurant-nashville,3.0,26,"Nashville, TN",Lisa E.

"5511 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"My wife, and I decided to go here today for lunch. I had never been here and she hasn't been here for a very long time. As soon as we got in there was a worker that asked if it were just the two of us. We agreed and he rushed us off to a table. No smile. No greeting. Just come in and sit down. At first I thought this guy was going to be our waiter, but then a very helpful gentleman came from the back and asked if we were ready to order or did we need more time. Considering we had just sat down we still needed some time. They brought us out some nice hot nachos for a start which was so good that we went through a basket and a half of them. Not to mention the salsa was great too. We finally put it our order and mine arrived before my wife got hers so I waited and just continued to munch on the nachos. My plate when it got to the table was very hot to say the to the touch. So much that you couldn't even touch the dish. More about this in my final thoughts. My wife got hers about a minute or two later and so we started ""digging in"". The meal plentyful to say the least. So much so that we couldnt finish our plates (due in part to them nachos earlier). The food was up to par, but not by much. As I had said earlier my food got there roughly about two or three minutes before my wife's did. When she got hers we both started eating immediately but the ground beef in mine tasted like..... well not as fresh as the hot plate would've made you think. It is my belief (not confirmed) that they took food and reheated it (thus making the plate blistering hot). All in all the food and experience wasn't too bad. Not to mention we only paid $14.05 (plus a two dollar tip which doesn't really count) for two large plates of food, unlimited nachos, and two drinks. Not bad at all for what we paid. I wouldn't say to stay away from this place. In fact if you like to drink it may be a good choice.

"1719 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"I love hibachi. I've had really good hibachi experiences, and I've had fairly poor hibachi experiences. My experience at Goten was middle of the road. Some aspects were below average and some above average. I'll start with the below average first. The ambience is less than desirable. It feels somewhat similar to having dinner in the boiler room depicted on Nightmare on Elm Street. I'm not saying it was a nightmare, but the exposed pipes in the ceiling and the dishes, glassware, silverware, and five-gallon buckets in the dining area are less than desirable. The food was on par with the typical hibachi grill. Not spectacular, yet, not poor either.Now, on to the positives, the chef was friendly and enthusiastic, moreso than a lot of the hibachi chefs I've encountered. The chef was also very accommodating for a pescetarian diner at the same table.  The service was much faster and better than the typical hibachi restaurant. Hibachi restaurants usually always suffer from slow to nearly non-existent service. Overall, I would sum it up as an average dining experience that hit my craving for a hibachi dinner.",Goten Japanese Restaurant,6153214537,11 reviews,2014-06-17,"Somerset, KY",/biz/goten-japanese-restaurant-nashville,3.0,45,"Nashville, TN",Derek S.

"1719 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"You may find reasonably priced sushi here but nothing that will tempt you to mosey on back for another visit....I met a couple of colleagues here for an impromptu dinner and was curious to what the outcome would be as I have never really had Goten on my radar as a spot that I was eager to try. It was dinner primetime at around 7:30pm and Goten was pretty empty with the exception of maybe 2-3 other tables. We sat around the Hibachi grill but I opted for a sushi roll, bowl of miso soup., and a glass of red. Again, it was satisfying but nothing stellar was offered in food or vibe.

"1719 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"No tricks/entertainment, $4 Miller lights, 18% gratuity and the messiest dining experience ever, food was cold by the time it was done.The night started with waiting for members of the party we were with to arrive.  Our party of 12 and another party of about 20 were crammed into the waiting area as we waited for the bastard stragglers that they refused to let us sit without (if 11 out of 13 are there and the other 2 just called and will be there in 10 minutes, sit the group).  So with nearly 25 people milling about in the waiting area and the more claustrophobic hanging outside the doors, our party was finally allowed to sit when the last 2 managed to work their way into the restaurant.The chef who showed up had 2 tricks - the volcano standard and butterfly... the volcano was basically a standard volcano except everything on it was on fire and everything around it was on fire, the butterfly was a slab of butter he threw.  There were no other silly tricks.From my seat I could watch 2 other chefs doing roughly the same no-tricks cooking.  Ok, I thought... as long as it's good.A little bit into the prep rice started flying everywhere.  I added a photo if I'm not mistaken of rice 11 inches off the grill on my cup.  Would not have been an issue if it were not extremely buttery rice, it was everywhere.  Table, pants, in my water.Chef explained he was not a normal chef, that for some reason he had been drafted to do the hibachi and that was why he did not do the whole shebang... would have sufficed if there were not 2 other chefs in plain site doing much the same prep.Salad comes out, it's generic costco salad with a mustard dressing on it that was ok, but nothing special.Fried rice got done, plunked on the plates. It was another 5 or 6 minutes till  the veggies got on the plate, I'd already started eating the rice as it was getting cold.  Rice was extremely buttery... I mean, it was butter with some rice thrown in.  Veggies arrived, they were somewhat cooked... they'd been in a pile and not stirred up enough so some were crisp and some were mush.  They were thoroughly unremarkable.He went through and prepped the meat for everyone, then in the last place threw my tofu into the oily spot where the chicken was being prepped to prepare it.  I'm not a horribly picky vegetarian but anyone more picky than me would have freaked.  Also, by this point the rice was barely above room temperature.Tofu gets done and is uncooked in the center and fried on the outside.  Nuclear hot so it warmed up the rice some. Was just not good.Basically the meal components were just eh. He took too long so everything was the wrong temp when served.Checks come out, there're ~$23 additional charges than I was expecting, 18% gratuity and they threw a portion of the birthday girl's meal on all of our checks... not a huge thing except I was not asked and someone else had her meal.  They also tacked on $6 it seems for fried rice for us, but I did not pay much attention to the menu when ordering.Got out of there with 4 beers and 2 & 1/7th meals for ~$75, which if it had been entertaining, or good, would not irk me so much.  This was like the Waffle Hibachi House",Goten Japanese Restaurant,6153214537,573 reviews,2011-01-24,"Nashville, TN",/biz/goten-japanese-restaurant-nashville,2.0,45,"Nashville, TN",Paul K.

"1719 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"I decided to check out this neighborhood spot that I had somehow managed to avoid for the past several years. I had the Salmon Teriyaki Bento box at lunch. The salmon teriyaki was very good. The rest of it was disappointing. The tempura dipping sauce lacked flavor beyond sweet. It came with an egg roll, too (???), which could have been from Sysco. I opted for fried instead of white rice, and it was clearly fried, but not with much for flavor. The worst, however, was the sushi. Using the proper rice with the proper seasonings is key to sushi. They sell envelopes of dehydrated vinegar as Tamanoi Sushinoko and I've used them successfully at home. I'm not enough of an expert to know where Goten went wrong (wrong rice, poorly cooked, not enough seasoning?), but it was wrong. The soup and salad to start were also disappointing. The soup was OK, but with one undercooked piece of pasta and a salty broth of little distinction.

The only good thing about the meal was the portions and the sushi. I got the beef teriyaki bento and subbed a tuna roll for the California roll. The tuna roll was good (but its honestly very hard to mess up such a simple thing), the tempura was soggy, the beef teriyaki was overdone and tasted like nothing but sauce, the sunomono was alright but had little flavor (I know its supposed to be lightly flavored but come on). The most flavorful thing on the plate was the orange slices.As said in other reviews, the service was also poor. I had ordered white rice with the meal (which is actually the default and fried rice was $1 extra, though they do not tell you so) but was given fried rice. The waiter even tried to charge us for it. The only time we saw him, too, was when food came out.All in all, disappointing. I really wish I had the 5 star experience some yelpers got, but I can't even accept that as a 3 star quality meal.

"1719 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"It's the Cirque du Soleil of the food world.No really!  The chefs juggle their knives and set towers of onions on fire.  Then, you get to eat the food that tastes like it was prepared by the feet of a sweaty acrobat named Ling Ming.  Hibachi is a tough sell for me because you end up sitting next to randoms that look like Kenny Rogers and tell you stories about ""the service.""  But I thought I would give it a whirl.The meal opened with soup and salad.  Soup?  No.  Broth? Yes.  Broth does not equal soup.  There were 8 noodles in the bottom of the bowl.  I know because I counted.  The guy next to me, Kenny Rogers' twin, was lucky enough to get 10 noodles AND a single floating mushroom slice in his broth.  I decided from that moment that Kenny was my mortal enemy for the duration of that meal.  Salad?  Ehh, that's debatable.  I realize that salad doesn't have a strict definition, but it should.   In my world of culinary righteousness, iceburg lettuce and unidentifiable, ginger-based creamy dressing don't qualify as salad.  In fact, iceburg lettuce doesn't even qualify as food.  It's just crunchy atmosphere.  Even Kenny passed on the salad.The main meal was salmon, veggies, fried rice, and a myriad of the usual Asian condiments - soy, terriyaki, and the weird orange one everyone seems to like but nobody knows what it is.  So the guy starts doing his little shenanigans with the knives and what-not.  He drops the knife constantly.  I thought he was going to take off his head, or at least that big dumb hat he was wearing.  He really sucked at it, which is fine; just cook my food.  I came here to eat not watch you fail at juggling.   After he didn't juggle anything for a long while, he finally starts cooking.  That's all fine until he cracks the eggs for the fried rice and quite obviously left some of the shell in there.  I honestly don't know how he didn't see that.  Anyway, I judged him for that.  MEANWHILE, Kenny is asking me for sips of my beer.  He poured it on his soup spoon.  Who does that?  What a weirdo.Food hits my plate.  And I do mean literally.  I consume.  Luckily someone else got the eggshell, but you bet your bottom dollar I was looking for it.   It tasted like something from ChinaBoat, a shady takeout place I used to go to in college that had a questionable number of cats roaming the premises.  I did have a bite of someone's steak (not Kenny's) and it was a decent cut of meat.  I didn't eat the dessert.  It was some kind of sourbet thing.  But I will give it a C- since Kenny ate all his.  Guess they didn't have sourbet back in Nam.I guess I don't see the appeal of hibachi. I'm pretty sure it's something that white trash families do for a ""nice"" dinner.  Bottom line?  Skip it.

"1719 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Very mixed feelings on this place. Please also keep in mind my review is based strictly on sushi and not on the hibachi. After being dead tired of Delta delaying my flights (in Atlanta), I decided to opt on getting Goten as opposed to going out to Franklin to visit one of my favorite sushi places anywhere, Sake. The prices seemed to be moderately reasonable for the sushi. $5 was the typical price for the average rolls and the Nigiri pieces were around $5 for two pieces. I ordered the White Tuna & Yellowfin Nigiri along with an Alaskan Roll and a Shrimp Crunchy Roll. I will say the Nigiri pieces were astonishingly flavorful. This is also extremely applicable to the yellowtail. Impressively fresh and tasty. I was very satisfied with those two choices. However the quality took a bit of a sharp nosedive when it came to the rolls. The Alaskan roll was about a 6 out of 10 on the flavor-o-meter. The sushi was standard in flavor but not anything eye opening. I was however extremely disappointed with the Crunchy Shrimp Roll. The roll was very very flavorless. And the tempura within the roll was not crunchy at all. My guess is probably the shrimp was fried way ahead of time. Otherwise I don't know how to explain soggy tempura. (But as I said, just a guess). I felt that I totally wasted my money on that roll. On a final note, I was not very impressed at all with the staff. Even though it was a pickup order, they did not show the slightest of courtesy when I picked up my food. Their stares were cold and in a sad way, mean. I was thanked though as I left, so at least at the end they attempted to act like humans if even for a split second.

There were approx. 80 in all.  I couldn't even talk to my date.  I asked the manager if he would please ask them to quieten down a little so the rest of us could enjoy our time at the restaurant but his exact words were the following:   ""No, I will not.  They have been coming here every year for the past few years and I am not going to bother them"".  I was not the only one to complain nor the only one to leave.  I will never go there again.  I understand that this group was having fun but if I feel that if they were disrupting the other patrons, then it is the the managers duty to say something or else risk losing business from future customers who will want to come by multiple times throughout the year.  It seems to me that all he cared about at the time was these individuals and how much money he was going to make rather than the 2 of us or anyone else there.",Goten Japanese Restaurant,6153214537,37 reviews,2013-09-22,"Nashville, TN",/biz/goten-japanese-restaurant-nashville,1.0,45,"Nashville, TN",D K.

The girl who helped us was mildly friendly, her forced smile and half-assed assistance was less than appreciated. Her disregard for customer service was exceeded only by her fellow employee's complete lack of acknowledgement that there were people dining in the place. He was spread out atop a table in the dining room, with his sweater and arms as a pillow, joking loudly then falling in and out of sleep. We were annoyed and disappointed to say the least. When I have come here in the past for lunch, I have always had a positive experience which is why I am still rating it 3 stars. The employees at lunch hour have always been pleasant and helpful both in the drive thru and when I sit and eat. Their daily specials are always good. I have enjoyed all of the food I have tried here, including the egg and cheese sandwich and home fries I had during the trip I referenced above. I will continue to come here for lunch, as it is one of very few good places to eat near my office, but I am incredibly disappointed that anyone who behaves like that is employed.",Bar-B-Cutie,6154543454,111 reviews,2011-05-10,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bar-b-cutie-nashville-4,3.0,15,"Nashville, TN",Jenn Z.

"7638 Hwy 70 SNashville, TN 37221",3.0,"In my continuing search for decent Chinese food while visiting Nashville for business, 3 friends and I went to dinner here last night. As Michael M notes, there were quite a few people eating there, although I disagree with his ""which means it must be good"". It can also mean the people dining have no experience with good Chinese food.First, though, let's look at what seems to satisfy everyone - quantity. Yes, there are a lot of different dishes available. Even sushi, and a hibachi-style grill.Unfortunately, most of the sushi is filled with crabstick, a pet peeve of mine as my wife is violently allergic to it. I wish the FDA would demand it be labelled such instead of ""crab""! There is no soy sauce available in the sushi are, though low-sodium soy sauce is available at each table. When I asked for regular soy sauce, I was told they had none.There are also none of the small soy sauce dishes one associates with sushi. When I asked for one, I was given a plastic takeout container instead.The salad buffet is forgettable - iceberg lettuce, still water-logged from washing. The cheapest salad dressings available, and no ginger dressing to be seen. The fruits look good to the eye until you taste them and realize they've been kept in the fridge for far too long.The hibachi grill was my next stop. I loaded some shrimp, daikon, rice, mushrooms, water chestnuts, and pork onto my plate, carefully keeping meats seperate from vegetables and rice, assuming they'd also be cooked seperately. Not so. In what I can only call a ""dumping technique"", the chef put a pat of butter on the grill (which had not been wiped down from the previous customer, by the way), dumped my plate onto it, threw the food around for a few minutes, then dumped it back onto the plate. The result was one big mush, and some very undercooked shrimp. When I bit into one and asked him to re-cook the shrimp, he dumped the whole plate back onto the still-unwiped grill, pressed down with the spatula for a minute, then dumped it back onto a new plate. The new plate was the best part of the grill experience. The hot sauce I asked for wasn't spicy. The pork tasted like a meat substitute, only worse. And the fact that the grill didn't get wiped down and cleaned after each customer's dish was made means if you have any food allergies, this is not a good idea for you!On to the ""Chinese buffet"". Spicy chicken, General Tso's, fried chicken all tasted exactly the same. When my wife pressed her chicken wing, oil oozed out and dripped all over the table. Disgusting. One of the waitrons came to replace the old (so old the edges were blackening) pork with vegetables with a new pan, then dumped the old remainders on top of it. The egg drop soup was full of glutinous liquidy ""something"" - we couldn't agree on what it was - it was inedible, though. The chicken with broccoli seemed to be coated with the same substance. The person at our table with an MSG allergy said it was more MSG than she'd tasted in years, and she stopped after a few bites. I could go on, but it's not worth it. For $14.95 I had one of the worst Chinese meals of my life, and that's saying something. Everyone at our table agreed, it was horrendous. If you must have buffet in the Nashville area, don't bother with this - go to Golden Coast, on West End, but only for the weekend buffet. The actual menu is not very good there either.One good food at this restaurant - the frog's legs. Surprisingly tender and nicely spicy.

"7638 Hwy 70 SNashville, TN 37221",3.0,"I was formerly a fan of Asihi, but that all changed with my visit today. I went in for an extremely late lunch/early dinner since they were having a 1/2 off special all day to celebrate their anniversary. The place was full, and there were notably a lot of families with children there (more than you usually see). There were several children under age 10 milling around the buffet unattended and serving themselves, even though that is against health regulations. Clearly that is not the fault of the restaurant, but what has caused me to come back and give a 1-star review is management's reaction to an unattended child contaminating a pan of food. I witnessed a boy around 6 walk over to the fruit and dessert table and pick up several squares of jello, squish them in his hands, smell (and maybe lick?) them, then before i could stop him, he dropped them back into the pan. Immediately after this, I stopped the manager as he walked by and told him what happened. He asked me which piece of jello the kid touched, and I told him that it was impossible to tell, but that it didn't matter b/c since he had put it back in the pan with the rest, it was all contaminated and needed to be disposed of. The manager then proceeded to use the spoon to scoop one random square of jello onto a plate and remove it from the bar. The rest of the contents of the pan were left there for people to serve themselves from. I was beyond appalled and also made sure to inform the mother of the child what he had done, she was apologetic and gently reprimanded him. As I exited the restaurant, I once again informed the manager that he was incorrect not to remove the jello, and pointed out to him that jello is a very inexpensive product and even if it weren't, it is better to throw out contaminated food than to risk the health of his customers in the interest of his bottom line. Anyone who knows anything about public health and the spread of disease knows that just one such incident as I witnessed tonight could leave a multitude of diners ill. Hands are the dirtiest parts of our bodies, let alone little hands that are curious and often touch things that should not be touched. What I witnessed was at minimum stomach churning, and at worst could be deadly. This is flu season, and stronger strains of influenza are multiplying every day. Who's to say this child was not carrying the flu or anything else (staph anyone?). Now anyone who ate any of that jello could be at risk for becoming ill.  I am disappointed that a $1 pan of jello was more important to the manager of Asihi than trying to preserve the integrity of the food served and thereby preserve the health of his customers. Don't believe their 92 health safety score, the actions of the manager in this situation tell the true story of how much food safety is valued at Asihi. If this is the reaction to something that happened in front of patrons, then I shudder to think what is really going on in the kitchen where no one can see. The DOH will be getting a complaint from me regarding this matter.",Asihi Asian Cuisine,6156468865,8 reviews,2012-12-19,"Nashville, TN",/biz/asihi-asian-cuisine-nashville,1.0,36,"Nashville, TN",M R.

"7638 Hwy 70 SNashville, TN 37221",3.0,"A very typical, low-end All-In-One Asian buffet.  The food is pretty bland.  The fried selections have a very strong grease flavor -- not overly greasy, but the oil they use is either old, poor quality, or Valvoline.A couple of items like the roast chicken (not very Asian) and the frog legs (only try them if you see them put out fresh, _hot_ ones) are not bad.However, for the most part I would not go back for the food.  This is really the ""Shoney's"" of Asian.  I have brought home frozen Asian TV Dinners from Publix that had more flavor.I would gladly pay 50% more ($15 versus $10), and would be a regular customer if they would just get a chef who ensures that the food is flavorful, properly seasoned, and more authentic.I know it is possible for a an Asian buffet to get it right.  On a few driving trips to and from Florida, we have stopped at a couple of really wonderful places in Georgia with lots of fresh, flavorful dishes -- they even had prawns with the heads on!  Further, not one of them had Pizza on the buffet.I give Asihi two stars because I did not see any bugs, and none of us got sick after either trip to the place.Parting Thought:You know you are in trouble when the Asian restaurant has Pizza on the buffet.",Asihi Asian Cuisine,6156468865,22 reviews,2011-02-10,"Nashville, TN",/biz/asihi-asian-cuisine-nashville,2.0,36,"Nashville, TN",BJ S.

"7638 Hwy 70 SNashville, TN 37221",3.0,"My husband and I had eaten here a few times before we decided to never come back. Yeah the food is not great, no sashimi option and the hibachi grill guy is unfriendly but the reason we decided to not return has to do with oysters. We came in for lunch and apparently they were setting up for dinner shortly after we got there because as I made my final round for dessert I spotted oysters that had just been put out. I grabbed a couple for my husband and dropped them off as I continued looking for dessert. When I headed back a very upset looking husband informed me we were leaving. Apparently while I was away the waitress had come by and tried to take our check to add the cost of dinner on it. When my husband inquired why he was informed that the oysters are for dinner only. He told her that we didn't realize that but her only solution was to charge us or take the plate away from him. Incredible. On the way out we informed the manager ( owner?) that we would not be returning due to what happened and she responded by telling us that is why there is a sign by the oysters. I let her know that when I grabbed them the sign was not up yet so we had no idea. No one seemed to care that they caused a misunderstanding and they made no attempt to resolve it with any modicum of customer service. The better option would probably have been to explain they are for the dinner service so we know for next time and offer to let us have them this time -- not take away our food!",Asihi Asian Cuisine,6156468865,21 reviews,2011-04-07,"Yachats, OR",/biz/asihi-asian-cuisine-nashville,1.0,36,"Nashville, TN",Lucy L.

"2828 Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"Hello there fellow foodies. I signed onto Yelp today and had decided on pizza, however, this ""Chinese Buffet"" place caught our eye while walking to the restaurant. Almost always a good choice since there's usually something for everyone, we peeked in to take a look. The smell and reasonable price kept us in.Decor is typical for a place like this although the size of the buffet stations didn't look too promising. Before we committed to the idea, I did a quick walk through and decided that it looked better close up. All of the usual fare that I expected plus some neat extras, such as sushi with strawberries on top and Happy Mother's Day written in...well, I don't know but it was a nice touch. The deserts, also just your typical strawberry and chocolate cakes with something jelly on top and macaroons, were lined in an old fashioned glass bakery case. The one thing that I can say is that the crab wontons were really good. There's only one other china buffet that I have been too in various states that I actually like it, so I was happy. So, the problems? Some of the food was cold or at best barely warm, the ice cream was out and no new sushi was put out once the few pieces of sushi were gone. the service was ok, but other than picking up the plates when we left to get something else, I never actually talked to anyone. I didn't even see them leave the check although that's not actually a problem. My glass wasn't empty and I didn't have to eat with dirty plates on my table.Some of my favorite items: butter shrimp (tastes like breaded shrimp covered in sweetened condensed milk!), garlic green beans, salmon and almost any vegetables with flavor.

"208 4th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",2.5,"After a bad experience at Fleet Pub around the corner in Printer's Alley..I had very few minutes left of my lunch time..so I stopped in at Taste of Italy. I had never been here before and they offer a lunch buffet for $7.95. I didn't have enough time during my lunch to seat and eat there, but the buffet looked like there was some choices, so I probably would have if not in a hurry.The lady behind the counter said I could choose 2 slices off the buffet for $4.00 with taxes it was $4.26 so I chose a slice of each supreme style slices since I prefer veggies on my pizza..the only other option was a ham and pineapple...Not a fan personally..but they all looked appetizing. They also have bread sticks and salad on the buffet..I thanked her and grabbed my purchased and walked back to my office. The pizza smelled good but it was not very hot. I arrived back at my cubical and ate my lunch in the 10 minutes I had left..not good to gulp...but hey, I should have just ate downstairs at Chic filet or gone to Panera...my two standbys..I wanted to be adventurous and try some new location...to my unhappy experience all I received for my efforts was 15 wasted minutes at the Pub in the Alley, and two slightly cold over priced for the food quality slices of pizza and a tummy ache for gulping my food down in a hurry and some fast paced sweat breaking walking through town...Well at least I did get some EXERCISE..I guess that was the PERK REWARD..I might do this restaurant again, if I had time to sit down and enjoy the inside atmosphere and order a entire pizza pie to share with my family..might be a total different experience. I am not blaming them for the cold pizza, it is not their fault I wasted most of my lunch at the joint around the corner..so I will definitely recommend that you try Taste of Italy and form your own opinion..I am definitely going to try them AGAIN...I love pizza and their sauce had a good taste...",Taste of Italy,6157322000,781 reviews,2014-06-26,"Nashville, TN",/biz/taste-of-italy-nashville,3.0,21,"Nashville, TN",Melissa B.

"7066 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"El Sombrero on Charlotte Pike is my new pick for best Mexican in Nashville.  I had liked La Hacienda before in Nolensville the most, but I'm giving the nod to El Sombrero.First, I got the cheese drip with Chorizo.  It was very good.  The chips are a little thicker and warm.  The salsa was freshly made, but no heat. (I prefer a little heat)I got the shrimp tacos, which came with three tacos.  There were four large shrimp in each taco.  The shrimp tasted fresh.  I was impressed that for only 10.49 I could get 12 large, good shrimp on my tacos.  It was a little strange that the cabbage came in the form of a slaw, but it tasted fine and acted like the yogurt sauce for the tacos.  I also liked that I got to decide how much to put on.  The pico de gallo was on point and fresh.  My ONLY complaint with these is that the corn shells should have been heated on a cast iron pan and crisped a little bit.  They were only steamed, which made them lack flavor and fall apart easily.My wife complained about the music, but she was also very happy with her meal.  The kid's meal was very good and affordable.I will be returning!!",El Sombrero,,32 reviews,2015-05-07,"Nashville, TN",/biz/el-sombrero-nashville-2,4.0,22,"Nashville, TN",Josh C.

"7066 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"4 stars is the average review for El Sombrero and I would say that is pretty accurate.First off, if you think the only good Mexican restaurant is an ""authentic"" one where there is no cheese on anything and they serve nothing but grilled fish tacos, El Somb is not the place for you. This is a greasy Tex Mex style restaurant, and it excels at being one, but snobby Southern California Mexican food it is not (thank god).Chips and Salsa- Pretty good, chips are medium thickness, served warm. The salsa is chunky, not spicy at all, and generally refreshing. Cheese Dip- lots of options here, I went with the chorizo one and it was really good. A few other people in their reviews didn't like the plain cheese dip (communists) but given you have the option of getting cheese dip with meat in it and they foreclosed this option to get just cheese tells you everything you need to know about their judgement, or lack thereof-SLAMMEDFajitas- I got the mixed fajitas that come with BEEF RIB. Yes you read that correctly, Beef rib fajitas. Coming from Las Vegas, the literal desert of Mexican food, I had already gorged myself like a Lion on chips and cheese and then got an enormous plate of fajitas presented to me. I ate until I almost exploded, took a break, and then ate some more. The little plate of accouterments that comes with the Fajitas was pretty meh but as a wise man once said- you don't make friends with salad. I ate until i thought I was going to die, until I was seeing light spots in my field of vision, until I considered going to the bathroom and throwing up so I could eat more, I ate for hours and then looked down at my plate... I had only eaten like 1/3rd of the fajitas. Jesus. Take me now- it can only go downhill from this pointPrice- very reasonable. I would say the price per lb of food I consumed was like 6-7 cents.Service- ok so this was a little lackluster. Drink refills could of been more timely, and when we asked for random things like some lime or cilantro they took their time bringing it- hence the 4 stars.In closing, beef rib fajitas.",El Sombrero,,150 reviews,2015-01-14,"Las Vegas, NV",/biz/el-sombrero-nashville-2,4.0,22,"Nashville, TN",Scott P.

I can't go without ordering the guacamole casero. It's very fresh and chopped, not mushy. It needs lime juice and salt, but I like that they leave that for you to add to taste. The chicken is usually great, and the tortilla soup is another fresh, delicious option. Most items are not very hot, but you can add fresh jalapenos if you want some heat. The restaurant is very kid friendly, and I often take my three boys (0,2,5) for lunch by myself with no problems.

"230 Thompson LnNashville, TN 37211",5.0,"So driving pass Briley Prkway on my way home I saw this food truck.I normally don't stop for food trucks. There are so many off Nolensville Rd and I admit I've had my share of food trucks and some not so great off these roads.I walked up and this place had a simple menu. One thing it's a food truck that doesn't move. It stays where it is so don't let that fool you. Don't expect to sit down and dine, this is a order and go. But you can call in ahead to order.Simple and plain on the order and easy to read. Picture patches with the number. As Andrew Zimmern from Travel Channel would say, ""If it looks good, eat it!""They have 99 cent tacos. I ordered one of each a total of six tacos. I also ordered their Carne Asada Sandwich. The tacos def. tasty. In Spring Hill there's Taco Express. One of my favorites. They would have 99 cent Tue. tacos but you had to have cash. This place I can have tacos for the same price anytime during the week. Win! Win!Any Mexican food or authentic places have to have flavor. This place does the job. And if they give you a hot pepper from the grill, IT's HOT. Beware and eat slowly. Their salsa also is hot but great on the tacos. Bagged and sitting in my car ready to eat at home, I could smell the aroma's filling the car I tempted to stop and eat on the side of the road.If you like to try a food truck and skeptical, this place is def. a worth a try. They had a 100% health inspection posted on the window and def. will be back.Look for the big yellow food truck off Briley at the Shell gas station.

"5751 Nolensville PikeNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"To sum up this place in one word: Bland. Walking up to the door promises a legit dining experience when you see the homemade tortillas being cooked in the front window, but the rest of the food fails to live up to the expectation. The salsa tasted like plain tomato sauce (no onions, cilantro, etc in it) and we were served cold stale chips to go with it. The tomatillo salsa wasn't bad (had to ask for that specially), but that didn't solve the stale chip problem. My husband and I ordered the chicken fajitas, and while they weren't bad, they weren't great. I enjoyed that there were tomatoes in the fajita mix (not all places do that), but the chicken was pretty bland - didn't taste like it had been marinaded at all. The rice and guac that came with it weren't too bad, but the refried beans suffered the same bland fate as the rest of our meal. The one high note? Those homemade tortillas. Those were delicious!The restaurant seemed understaffed to us. Our server seemed to be taking care of a large section, which kept him extremely busy. While our fajitas came out pretty fast, he wasn't able to get us the tortillas for quite a while. We weren't going to hold it against him since he was so busy trying to take care of a bunch of tables, but it was a little frustrating to sit and stare/pick at my food for nearly 10 min waiting on tortillas. Despite the staffing issues, the staff was very nice.However, I think the most offensive thing was that while we were eating, not one but two people (two separate times) came up to us to solicit money for some organization. The first woman wouldn't leave our table even after we both said ""no, thank you"" multiple times! Excuse me, but I'm trying to have a nice dinner with my husband. I don't want people barging up to my table to ask me for money. I don't know if management knows these people are doing this, but if they do and are allowing that, I think that is inexcusable. So, in closing, I personally have no plans to go back here. There are so many other Mexican restaurants in the area that offer tasty menus and good cooking.

"5751 Nolensville PikeNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"My favorite mexican joint in Nashville.I hear so much about other mexican restaurants that just usually underperform for me, but La Terraza has never hit a sour note.  The service is ALWAYS friendly and the margaritas are good.  If I had one complaint it's that the hotness/spiciness of the queso and salsa isn't always consistent.  Twice in the many times we've been there, it was so hot we couldn't eat it... although we are admittedly gringos.  Try the ""tacos authenticos"" ala carte.  Ask for them with onion and cilantro.  It's the best ""taco truck"" taco I've ever had.  I'll frequently go there when I'm craving taco truck tacos, and I get chips and salsa and margaritas to boot!",La Terraza,6158350106,9 reviews,2013-08-03,"Smyrna, TN",/biz/la-terraza-nashville,4.0,31,"Nashville, TN",Katee W.
"5751 Nolensville PikeNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"Being that I'm 6 months pregnant, and a fan of Mexican American cuisine, this review will be a little biased.I love the feel of this place.  It is packed tightly in a strip mall, but feels like a free-floating establishment once inside.  The staff are kind and friendly.  They work quietly and efficiently.  The food is always good, and in plenty.I'm a fan of their chicken chimichanga (because really, how much healthier can you get with fried burritos smothered in ""cheese sauce"" [read: sarcasm]), and their Tacos Authenticos.  And, though a small detail, I love that they serve their drinks in those rather large plastic cups (IE, troughs).The only whiny complaint I have is that they do little with carnitas.  And I miss carnitas.  I used to get fresh carnitas with cilantro, onion and lime when I lived (albeit briefly) in Cali.  And I miss it muchly.  The carnitas I've found here is just subpar by comparison - too fatty, overcooked, and bland.But I digress...The prices are, of course, fantabulous.  A family of five can easily eat here for under $30.  And the drinks are made well (margarita night - GOOOOOO).",La Terraza,6158350106,26 reviews,2012-03-07,"Topeka, KS",/biz/la-terraza-nashville,4.0,31,"Nashville, TN",Katie H.

"5751 Nolensville PikeNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"Despite living across the street from this restaurant for well over 4 years - I had never been there.  Much less even really acknowledged its existence.  ILast night a friend and neighbor was having a welcome home party for his dog - since he had been missing for 9 days.  Well, a 2 hour party turned into a 5 hour party - finished off by a short drive across the street to La Terraza for some food and more drinking.  Even though I was aware of it being there - I still had never been.  Instead opting to go to El Sombrero just down the street at Lenox Village.Seating at 7pm on a Sunday night was very easy and they happily accommodated our group of 6 people.  We weren't seated very long before the server came over and got our drink orders and delivered them very quickly to our table along with copious amounts of chips and salsa which, by the way, was very nice and flavorful.  I can see where some people may not like the salsa because it isn't super chunky - its a pretty smooth salsa.  But I like that personally.  I pitcher of margaritas we were served was very, very good.  A friend of mine talked to another table of people who were drinking something out of these huge glasses and he asked them what they were drinking.  They said it was beer with clamato juice - they described it as a beer based bloody mary.  Several of the members of my table tried and described it as being very good...but I don't like bloody mary's OR beer - so I doubt I'd enjoy it.  But it was interesting to look at none-the-less.For dinner - I had the Chimichanga with re-fried beans and rice.  It was VERY good.  The crust for the chimi was light but held together well.  The melted queso blanco they pour over top was very good as well.  The re-fried beans were a little runny - but the rice was very good.  More than anything - everything tasted fresh - which was great.  You could really taste all the ingredients.All in all - it was a good place for a good meal.  The restaurant was clean.  The service was friendly and efficient.  It was a fun atmosphere for sure.  Its a new restaurant (for me) close to my house that I won't hesitate to visit again in the future - if not for the food - for the margaritas for sure!",La Terraza,6158350106,86 reviews,2011-01-31,"Nashville, TN",/biz/la-terraza-nashville,4.0,31,"Nashville, TN",Joshua B.

"5751 Nolensville PikeNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"It always seems to be the unassuming mallstrip Mexican joints that fare the best in cuisine.  I first judge the quality of a Mexican restaurant by the complimentary chips and salsa set out immediately as you are sat.  (which is really the best thing about Mexican and Italian restaurants alike: immediate food).  However, the chips and salsa here weren't the best I've ever had.  Good, but not the best. The salsa was mild and didn't really have anything special going on. Chips were homemade and crispy, but again, not outstanding.HERE is where the outstanding comes in, and, my second judging point at any new Mexican restaurant I try:  Pescado Tacos. La Terraza's offers baked or fried Tilapia.  Having a choice in this matter is to my pleasure - anywhere I can shave off a few calories makes me a happy diner.  The tacos arrived on a large plate, three of them, along with a heaping mound of special seafood rice.  The rice was not typical Mexican rice - it was dotted with peas and little carrots and had been sautéed in a delicious light oil, much like Chinese friend rice.  It complimented the fish tacos perfectly.The baked tilapia was cradled in a choice of corn or flour tortilla (I chose corn), and topped with fresh tomatoes, onion and lettuce.  For the record, the seasonings on the fish itself were absolutely fantastic. The tacos also come with cheese, which I opted out of.  I don't like anything ruining the fresh, delicate flavors of my fish tacos, especially cheese. I squeezed fresh lime over all and I was absolutely in fish taco heaven.  Service was very friendly and prompt -- our waitress had a great smile. The atmosphere was nothing special, very typical of a generic Mexican restaurant, but the food is authentic and not run of the mill.Be prepared to leave satisfied and STUFFED!",La Terraza,6158350106,211 reviews,2011-12-30,"Chicago, IL",/biz/la-terraza-nashville,4.0,31,"Nashville, TN",Julia H.

"5751 Nolensville PikeNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"I'll NEVER EVER eat here again. We used to love this place and visited it 1-2 times every week, but it has been going downhill recently in quality. Little things at first like getting something wrong with our orders every visit or not including the sides that the menu said were included. Today this happened again and we shrugged it off, just asked the waitress for our missing food. I had a chimichanga with vegetables inside, I specified no meat, being a vegetarian for 10 years. A little over halfway into in something tasted weird, so I burrowed around in it and pulled out a big ole piece of steak. To me, this is as gross as you finding out your food has puppy meat or cockroaches in it. She first denied it was steak and we asked to talk to the manager. Over 5 minutes later she brings our check and says we can talk to the manager at the cashier, he wouldn't even come to the table to speak to us! We go up and explain there was steak in my food and that I haven't had meat in over 10 YEARS and we are very upset and I'm about to PUKE and CRY, and he SHRUGS. He also tries to DENY that the whole thing happened, that they cook veggies and meat separately. I don't know if it was carelessness or the cook thought it would be funny, but my boyfriend tried it, it was definitely steak. We ask to speak to the owner and he says that's him, which I seriously doubt, since there are 3 locations and he's only ever at this one. This guy couldn't even APOLOGIZE. I will never in my life set foot in this place again. VEGETARIANS BEWARE.

"5 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",2.5,"I'll give this place a 5, simply because it's a TGI Fridays. Anywhere else would've been a 4. Why? Because I went in with pretty low expectations. A large chain in the most crowded area of Nashville is normally a recipe for disaster. I must say I was pleasantly surprised.I went in with a friend from out of town and we were promptly seated by our extremely friendly and kind waitress. She was great. She pointed out specialties on the menu, and was very knowledgeable about all the dishes offered. My friend was trying to decide between two menu options, and she gave her opinion on which one she would choose and gave him reasons why. And they weren't reasons like ""that one tastes better"" or ""I don't like that"" either. She said that the first of the options was very traditional, essentially came from a box, and you could find virtually the same thing in a number of different places. The second choice was made in Fridays every days and was fresh. It may have been fluff, but it came off as honesty, which was a nice change from most sales pitches you get at chains. As for the food, it was rather delightful. Started with Tomato basil soup- in my opinion, better than Jason's Deli (although I'm sure it's not near as... real). It was tasty. Then I got the Parmesan Encrusted Chicken. The presentation, the flavor, and the portion were all perfect. It was a shockingly good entree. It was served with a tomato-mozzarella salad that was eh.... Take it or leave it. Finished it off with peanut butter pie for dessert. It was good, but about what you'd expect from Fridays.Tip, tax and all, I paid $17. Pretty snazzy for appetizer, entree, and dessert.

"5 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",2.5,"Went in for dinner and drinks after a long day of work.  It was a typical Fridays experience - loud, crowded, and decent food.  The open kitchen is a nice touch and the bar is spacious!  However, the actual dining ""room""/space is cramped and seats are not very comfortable.  We were seated at a tiny table for two right next to a ""server"" computer station and the restrooms, so the whole evening it was - servers gathering by the computer (two of them probably got a hotel room after work, if you know what I mean?!) and hosts bringing people back to the restrooms since they weren't marked with any signage.  High traffic area and a small table...not a great idea.  We ordered a watermelon mojito, electric lemonade, and a pink punk cosmo for drinks, pretzels and fried green beans for appetizers, chicken parmesan for dinner, and a salted caramel cake for dessert - and shared.  The watermelon mojito was interesting, wouldn't order it again.  The electric lemonade was yummy - an adult slushee.  My favorite was the pink punk cosmo which was served over pink cotton candy!  It was sweet and smooth!  The pretzels were delicious, buttery and hot!  They were served with a beer cheese that had bacon infused - not my taste, but my friend loved it!  The fried green beans are always a favorite of mine, even without the wasabi ranch dipping sauce.  The chicken parmesan was different.  It was served with a small portion of tortellini which was tossed in a caesar alfredo sauce - hmm, no.  Also, a tomato mozzarella salad - eh, not bad.  The chicken itself was also basted in caesar, so that was unusual but the breading was good and the chicken was not dry.  The salted caramel cake was a nice surprise.  It was a fair portion, served with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The cake was layered and not too sweet.Service was really great  - but maybe that was because I knew the server?!  Other servers passing by and gathering by the computer station seemed to be having a good time.Prices are reasonable...I recommend getting the ""deal"" ($12.99/14.99 for 2/3 courses) and then splurging on the drinks b/c it does add up, and really, who needs to eat that much?!I'm sure I will go back sometime, but next time I will definitely request a better table!",T G I Fridays,6155144900,33 reviews,2012-07-26,"Baton Rouge, LA",/biz/t-g-i-fridays-nashville,3.0,24,"Nashville, TN",Mrs. B.

"6606 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Hello there yelp!ers.So I recently went to this location for the first time as it is on the route I take to get to work via MTA bus. I was deciding on the surrounding restaurants and I felt burned out from them. I noticed this nifty looking sub shop and decided ""Why not? Been a while since I had SubWay.""But this place is so much better then SubWay by far. It's cleaner, the food is fresher, it's hot and they've got a good selection of product. One of the best things about this place is the Coca-Cola Freestyle drink machine, while it's a little bulky and not as streamlined as I'd like, it was still awesome. Over 120+ drink selections and a wide variety of flavorings you can add makes this machine worth checking out.Now, as to the reasoning behind the 4 stars? Well, one of the associates there seemed like he could care less about the guest aside from just taking their order and moving on. He had no personal touch, it was almost as if he were robotic and programmed to just take orders. It's associates like that that really annoy me. Obviously if you want people to return they'd do it not only for the food but for the workers, too. It makes the experience that much better. Now the manager there (noticeable by the collared shirts they wear) was very nice, talkative just right, and attentive to my needs. The second time I went there (because it was such a great atmosphere) he remembered who I was, which always means a lot to me as a consumer.But most certainly someplace to check out if you ever want great, hot food, several drink choices, and a cozy, hip atmosphere. Think twice about going to SubWay over Firehouse or you may regret the hesitation!Happy yelp!ing!",Firehouse Subs,6157396277,17 reviews,2013-06-24,"Madison, TN",/biz/firehouse-subs-nashville,4.0,23,"Nashville, TN",Justin M.

When I said I wanted a turkey with just lettuce and tomato, he said, ""That comes fully loaded with mayo, etc etc"". Um, I just said I wanted lettuce and tomato only. The worst part was that I only wanted a veggie sandwich to fit my vegan diet - no mayo and no cheese and no mushrooms (I did my homework beforehand so that I would know what ""veggie"" items to avoid). I don't know how many times I told him I just wanted veggies - no mayo, no cheese, no mushrooms. Got home with our subs, and had mayo, cheese and mushrooms. Thanks for not listening at all.

The clerk was kind enough to advise me to get the sub heated. He said it would be way better that way, and I wasn't disappointed at all. I also love their ordering process. You just choose a bag (each bag is labeled with the kind of meat you want), check off your toppings, and hand the bag to the clerk. No standing there pointing to ingredients or repeating 5 times that you want peppers and not onions. And they have a huge variety of toppings.

"2340 Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I just want to start out by saying that this Waffle House is just like any other Waffle House that I've been to.  The hubby and I came here a little past midnight to get some grub close to our hotel and this was one of our options.Since the CMA was this weekend, it was super super busy.  As soon as we came, we had to wait a couple of minutes for them to clean the table so we could sit down at the bar.  As soon as we sat down, around 15 people came in waiting to sit down and eat.  I'm not even exaggerating on how busy this place was.To be honest, when I first came in here, I got a little upset thinking that our server forgot about my hubby and me because we were waiting around 7-10 minutes to get our drinks served to us.  But after sitting there and looking around, I was reminded with how busy these workers were and that by sitting here, I should be expecting the wait time to increase.Deshona was one of the workers there that handled one situation in particular appropriately even though she didn't take this order to begin with.  There was a group that was truly disrespectful to all the workers about their service.  These people were drunk and obnoxious about the wait time.  This one girl in particular kept saying that she waited over an hour for her waffles and hash browns which was a lie.  The hubby and I came there way before she did and got our drinks, food, and our food eaten within 40 minutes.  She came 20 minutes after us, waited 5 minutes to order, then complained that she has been waiting for an hour for her order. Her guy friend then continued to make comments to the workers and his friends, ""What's taking so long? Isn't this supposed to be fast food?""  I just wanted to yell at this guy and tell him that if he wanted fast food, he should of just went to McDonalds, but this wasn't my fight so I kept it to myself.Come on now people!  This is Waffle House!  And if you come here at night, expect the drunk people and expect the wait time to increase.  You don't make the situation any better when you make a dramatic scene to these workers! They are doing their best and handling these situations to the best of their abilities, so GIVE THEM A BREAK!Overall, food is just as good as any Waffle House I've been to.  There's nothing so special about their food, but Charles sure does know how to make your food presentable to you.  Deshona was an amazing server who continued to make sure everyone was taken care of.  Don needs to be reminded with some things, but overall he did good enough for being under pressure with the rush.  I'd recommend this Waffle House to others looking for a late night grub, but expect to wait and don't give these workers such a hard time.  They are just doing their job and they are trying to accommodate to everyone as soon as they can.  They are only human!",Waffle House,6158854575,128 reviews,2015-06-15,"Cleveland, OH",/biz/waffle-house-nashville-13,5.0,33,"Nashville, TN",Julie D.
"2340 Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"After a full day and night in Nashville I was in dire need of sustenance. Luckily Waffle House was a half mile away from my hotel, so I made the journey. Upon entering the restaurant, I was greeted with smiling faces and was sat down quickly. Terri was the waitress who took my order. She was very charming and helpful. I ordered the All Star Special. I don't mess around when it comes to breakfast lol My food came quickly, was hot and mighty tasty. Terri was very attentive to my water and coffee levels which was perfect as I was constantly rehydrating lol  One of the things I hadn't realized was that when you are sitting at the bar seats at any Waffle House, you get to view the cooks, waitresses, etc interacting. Total transparency. In this particular case, it was a treat to watch the employees interact because they were communicating at a fast pace while keeping the overall work vibe fun and playful. The major thing that stood out to me was that they all were giving each other compliments and in turn brought that positive energy to the customers. That was a huge thing for me. Waffle House is Waffle House, BUT when you combine that kind of work environment with the food, it's a home run. I paid my bill and gave Terri a big ""thank you"".

"2727 McGavock PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,Throughout my many travels I have to say. I have never been to a Waffle House before. We had one heck of a order for this Waffle House. I have passed them a bunch of times when I'm down south. I always thought that it was chicken and waffles. I had no idea it's a all day breakfast spot. We were staying at the grand ole opryland resort. We had a late night and needed something desperately that morning. One of the guys I travel with always goes to Waffle House and he asks the hotel where breakfast places are when checking in. Our order consisted of 25 breakfast sandwiches 15 were bacon egg and cheese. The other 15 are sausage egg and cheese. The person behind looked at us funny when we said we needed 25 breakfast sandwiches. The staff was great they had no problem handling our order. They were working like crazy back there. Finally we got the 35 sandwiches. We did not look to see if there was 15 bacon egg and cheese or 15 sausage egg and cheese. But who cares if it wasn't exact. I had a sausage egg and cheese. It was really good the egg was a fried egg cheese and a sausage patty that looked hand formed. The bread was really crunchy like a grilled cheese sandwich. I did not hear one complaint from co workers that the food was bad. Overall this place is great. You can walk here from the opryland but it is a bit of a walk. They serve breakfast all day.

So is the seating arrangement, since this place was almost a mirror image of the ones I frequented on the other coast.I was in the shopping mall at 100 Oaks and had a hankering for something Asian-ish. I got my usual and it tasted just the way I expected it to. Up until I got to Nashville, I thought for sure I never had cream cheese in my Chinese food before. But when I saw their rangoons, I was suddenly reminded that I did have them back in California.

The location is super convenient, directly off of the 65 and close to 100 Oaks and the theater.  We first visited during Christmas time following a hellish shopping trip, the space is clean, organized and runs like a well oiled cafeteria-style, move that tray fast- kinda place. You request your selected dishes as they scoop them into your plate and serve you over a glass barrier. Fast and efficient.I also enjoy the clear view of the grill/kithcen area where the cooks are preparing the food,. The service is quick,  food served hot and the quality is better than most fast food style chains. Prices are definitely fair and they offer special items on the menu which change periodically like Coconut Shrimp which can be added to your meal or chosen as one of your ""meat"" choices. They also offer veggies, low mien, egg rolls, fried wonton and crab rangoon and fried rice. You can also get steamed rice if you prefer.

"2534 Powell AveNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"Two years in Nashville and the best Chinese food restaurant still currently open (What happened to Bamboo Garden?) is Panda Express.  And this makes me a sad panda. Well, Panda Express is definitely American Chinese food, it is filling, and it is cheap (around $6-8 per meal).  I would give it a C+ for authenticity, due to surprisingly good Gan Bao Chicken and stuff like black pepper and celery chicken and the honey walnut chicken that was always a guilty pleasure of mine as a kid.  Heck, I'm even support the orange chicken Panda Express claims to have invented.  On the other hand, they get docked for the sweet and sour and Mandarin Chicken.  Really, any dish with only meat on it should be skipped, for it will be liberally doused in sauce.  The food is cooked pretty quickly by a very visible kitchen team (with woks!), and service is prompt and friendly.  There is little I can complain about here....except during lunch and dinner, when this place is jammed with people like sardines.

The prices are cheap and the portions are adequate.  But PE is, like all fast food Chinese cuisine, an underwhelming experience.  The seasoning of most dishes  is bland, the meats are chopped into tiny pieces so that you can hardly tell what you are chewing, and the sauces are gummy and usually overly sweet.  The servers at the Powell Avenue location are pasty-faced runts with attitudes.  Aside from that, Panda Express is great!   =;)",Panda Express,6152798174,39 reviews,2011-04-16,"Nashville, TN",/biz/panda-express-nashville-2,2.0,27,"Nashville, TN",Douglas B.

"150 Donelson PikeNashville, TN 37214",4.0,"Having never tried Ethiopian food, I was really excited to make the trip with a few of my co-workers. Not really being able to compare it to anything, I can tell you that it was really interesting, sometimes in a weird way, sometimes in a delicious way.Our server was incredibly nice and welcoming. After asking us if we had ever had Ethiopian, she went on to tell us how it was customary to eat, and gave us a quick run through their selection. We decided on a combination platter of vegetarian and meat options, and being completely ignorant to what might be good, we ask our server to just pick her own favorites, which P.S was a great idea.I usually say that I am an outright carnivore, however, at Queen of Sheba's my most favorite dishes happened to their veggie dishes. I don't actually remember what anything is called, so forgive me, but I can tell you that their dish with yellow lentils and another dish of cabbage and carrots was a party in my mouth! Everything is served on and eaten with Injera. Basically Injera looks like a giant pancake and I was told it is made out of teff flour, which is something like wheat flour.

"1104 Ed Temple BlvdNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"I came across this drive-up only fourth stop on my Nashville BBQ tour after a recommendation from the guy working at Hog Heaven. Let me begin by saying, ""Get the fish!"" Do yourself a favor and skip the BBQ. The rib were good but nothing special. They lacked the flavor of better ribs, and the sauces consumed the flavor -- preventing the meat to shine. Okay, with that being said, the fish is fantastic. I got the catfish with onion, mustard, pickles, and hot sauce. It is served as a sandwich on white bread. Wow! The fish is cooked to perfection. The batter is peppery and complements the fish perfectly. This drive-up dive does fried fish  better than anyone else. (That last statement is pure speculation; I haven't tried much fried fish in TN.)

They are a bit spicy with the slaw but some extra BBQ sauce helps to make it more mild if you aren't a spicy food fan. 3. The mac n cheese is money.

"854 Hillwood BlvdNashville, TN 37209",2.5,"I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars, but at that point it kind-of feels like I'm splitting hairs...anyhow:I like the food at this place. I have had the Philly cheese steak plate, lamb gyro combo, and falafel combo; all were really tasty! Their seasoned fries are also excellent. They're crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, just the way I like them! As for the sauce, in both of my sandwiches there was a white sauce, but I don't think it was ranch. I tasted it, and after a little research, I'm pretty sure it's tzatziki. It doesn't taste like ranch to me, or at least not any ranch I've had before, and it tastes really good on the sandwiches they make. They also give you a huge amount of food, especially on the ""plate"" meals.That being said, the...*ahem*...ambience leaves something to be desired. Every time I've eaten here, my group has been the only patrons in the restaurant. The tile on the floor is starting to come up in places, some of the old, green booth seats are ripped in the seat, and much of the decor is really unappealing. I wouldn't say it's dirty but it doesn't give you the feeling that you want to sit and eat there, either. The gentlemen that work there were cordial but definitely men of few words. They pretty much just hang out in the back unless you ring the bell near the cash register or someone goes through the drive-thru line.However, I'll keep returning here because I think the food is really good.

Unfortunately, I could not get a clear answer on the differences. The one thing that i REALLY hate when it comes to eating gyros is when the sauce is pretty much ranch. I don't want ranch. I want feta and tzatziki, or at least some variation of a yogurt sauce. I also prefer the big fluffy pita bread instead of the pita pockets, but I tend to not be too picky about the bread.
