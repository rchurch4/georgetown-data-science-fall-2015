4.0,"Good but on the outskirts of Washington , really Chevy Chase, Maryland","This is a little busy restaurant. We came for lunch thinking it was close to the Washington Mall area. We were surprised to find it was way out of the way if you want to stay by the Sights area. We enjoyed the food a great deal. The crabcakes were a true Maryland delight! The staff and servers very helpful....
