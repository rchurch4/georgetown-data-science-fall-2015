4.0,Top Steak,"Tasty, juicy steak at around $50 a cut. Our group of 11 was highly satisfied with the main courses. The Cajun ribeye was our waiter's recommendation, but we ordered several different cuts and all were fine.
The Georgetown location is convenient. I lamented the decor, though, which really didn't seem much like a steakhouse.",Morton's,453,405,"March 26, 2013","Whistler, Canada",/Restaurant_Review-g28970-d450358-Reviews-Morton_s-Washington_DC_District_of_Columbia.html,4.0,72,"Washington, DC",MannyG2000

Excellent food however and consistent with the Morton's reputation - pricey.
