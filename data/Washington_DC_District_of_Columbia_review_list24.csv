4.5,Best Dominican food in the Columbian Heights Washington DC area,"I love this place! I really do, apart from the food, the brothers (hermanos) are great people. I have an out of town girlfriend from Texas, she walked in and asked to try every single dish before she decide which one she want to eat. The brothers were great! They were so accommodating, I am sure it is not possible...

4.5,Twins putting out some great food,"This place was recommended by the guy we bought a SIM card from, and I am glad we listened. Between the two of us, we tried almost everything. The twins behind the counter were great and piled the plates high with lots of good food. The bill was less than I expected and the food better. Great find in DC,...

4.5,A good neighbourhood find,"A Puerto Rican recommended me to eat in Los Hermanos, she said that is the closest she get for home cook Puerto Rican food. Then my personal trainer said he eat there often also, because it is good food. I was planning to go out on a Friday night, but cannot make it, so I just walked into this neighbourhood...

4.5,Homemade style,"You can taste different things in the same order. First you have to choose the sides, there are several options: different types of rice, beans, mashed potatoes and fried plantains. Then you have a bunch of slow cooked meats: chicken, goat, pork and beef.
I had rice with lentils and fried plantains and I picked a little bit of some...

4.5,Hole in the wall goodness!,"This cafeteria style Dominican restaurant is definitely worth the trip. No, the shop itself isn't much to look at, but I would be surprised to find authentic Dominican food this good anywhere else. I would go back for the yellow rice alone. The servers (twin owners of the shop) were extremely polite and very helpful to those who didn't know...

4.5,Home style Dominican food cooked to perfection,"The name translates to 'the brothers' but it should be the brothers, their mother and the rest of the family. This is all about homemade food served cafeteria style.
My fiancée and I come here regularly and I make a point of trying everything I see. The regulars like the pulled pork, salt cod, chicken or beef stew with rice...

4.5,"Great service, good eats.","We were immediately greeted with warm a warm welcome when we walked up to the counter. The staff talked us through everything as we made our selections (and we needed it). We chose the most popular dishes and they were all extremely delicious! Not super expensive with large portions. Someone even came by later with some plantains to try. Bottom...

4.5,"Columbia Heights lunch, basic and perfect","Found on an Internet site, because as tourists to DC, we never would have noticed this little place. It is where the local folks catch their lunch. The twin brothers who run this prepare the pork or chicken in several different ways, very flavorful, with sides like rice or yucca or plantains. This is cafeteria style but really more like...

4.5,Meaty treat,"Me and my partner purposely end our runs here sometimes so we can finish with some meat. The two twin brothers are always there and always lets us get as much or little as we want. Last time we just got some pork for $5...so if you like us dont always want all the sides this is the place to...

4.5,"Very tasty, inexpensive, great service","Loved this place! I got the ""La Bandera"" plate with beef plus tostones and mofongo. The only drawback I see is that since it's cafeteria style, you'll occasionally get something that has been on a hot plate for a bit. This was the case with the beef on my Bandera...tasty, but could have been more fresh. The mofongo was right...
