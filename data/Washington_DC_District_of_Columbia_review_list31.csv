4.0,If you like Asian food you've got to eat here.,"Friendly staff, excellent food and if the weather is nice they have outdoor seating. Pad Thai, Rice Noodle Soup, Fresh Garden Rolls, and Spring Rolls were our favorite. They have a station filled with fresh ingredients like garlic, ginger, cilantro, chili paste, etc to add to your dishes. Really top notch!
They were right next to our hotel in Dupon...
