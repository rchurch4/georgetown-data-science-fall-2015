4.0,"Casual, waterfront view, comfortable, friendly staff...food's just ""OK""","I rated the Cantina Marina ""very good"" because it's a great place to go if you're looking for a casual environment, a Potomac setting, conversation with the people in your party, and very friendly and responsive staff. If you're looking for a culinary awakening you're in the wrong place.
You're probably not going to be dissatisfied with the food quality...

4.0,Perfect for Large Group Dinner,"We were traveling with 2 others families and had a large group to accommodate for dinner. They seated 6 adults and 7 children at two separate tables, which is fine by us. The waiter did an excellent job of keeping up with the children's needs and brought their food out first without having to be asked to do so. The...

4.0,Surprisingly Good,"Went here for a work dinner and was expecting pizza and such since it's part restaurant and part bowling alley. I was pleasantly surprised. The upstairs is an upscale italian restaurant complete with ample seating and full service bar. The food was very good. Not five stars, but a cut above Maggiano's. The capellini with tomato sauce was served hot...

4.0,Easter brunch was lovely!,"Easter brunch at Pinstripes was a lovely experience. The egg hunt for the kids, complete with an appearance by the Easter bunny, was a hit. The selection, quality, and value of food at the brunch was very good.

4.0,Very cool,"I gotta say, the attraction was the bocce and bowling. The food was pretty reasonable, the wait staff polite enough, the drinks were fine. Teaching ourselves to play bocce after dinner? Totally cool.

4.0,"fun bowling atmosphere, but pricey","I went to pinstripes with a few other friends, and overall this place is a rather upscale bowling alley.
There's a separate bar and eating area nowhere near the bocce and bowling areas, so this technically is a regular restaurant in some places. There are about four or five bocce courts, but I prefer to play bocce on the beach...
