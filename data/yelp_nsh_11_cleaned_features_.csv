That means bikes, 'industrial everything', beards, babies in ironic double-wide strollers, angry-looking young people... you know the drill. If this isn't your cup of tea (hyuck), you might not want to darken the doorway. But, if that kind of stuff doesn't cause a blip on your radar or you're part of the zeitgeist, c'mon in.For me, I take a positively Burrussian view of things: don't start none, won't be none. For those who don't speak [redacted], what I mean by this is, I'm all for letting people be who they are and do what they do so long as everyone's able to able by that same axiom. I've never had a problem with any of the above at BJE so all's well that starts and ends well. And what they do (coffee) starts & ends pretty well. Typically, I head here in the morning hours, so I'm looking for the standards breakfast-y items. My usual go-to is an everything bagel with sun-dried tomato cream cheese. Thankfully, I've never had the experience of finding mold on said bagel but you can trust & believe that if something like that ever happens, I'll be the first to post about it. To the contrary, the bagel options have always been fresh and pretty satisfying. I played around with the coffee selection before settling on the Bollywood. As the name suggests, the dominant flavors harken to India with a spice flavor that boasts cardamom and a silky, chai-like appearance/texture. In addition to being delicious, it's quite a relaxing beverage. It's the kind of drink that doesn't require conversation or debate. Simply sip on it, type away using BJE's free wifi and think about all the things the day has to offer. If the Bollywood doesn't strike your fancy (or disappears; it might have been a summer seasonal drink), BJE offers plenty of coffee concoctions to delight your tastebuds without sacrificing street cred.

"107 S 11th StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Before I moved to Nashville in late 2014, I visited well over a dozen times, going back to 2012. On each visit, I sought to explore the Nashville coffee scene. I have been to Bongo Java at least 10 times in the past two years.In the early days, I found Bongo Java's brewed coffee to be very nice and their espresso drinks to be among the best in Nashville - as far as I knew at the time - but still a notch or two lower than what I was used to. While I eventually checked out still more places, I kept going back to Bongo Java, but over time I noted a gradual decrease in quality, which may be attributable to the beans.In fact, in late 2014 I bought a bag of beans to grind and brew at home, either on the Bonavita or the Technivorm. I was put off by the labeling of ""medium roast"" on the bag. I guess I never noticed that before, because I went there for espresso drinks. That sort of categorization or labeling caused me to shake my head; it told me something new about them and how they view their customers.Yes, rather than presume that their customers are intelligent, they dumbed-down their labeling. I would rather see a general description or summary of the flavor profile on the bag, describing the end result of that crop of that bean, as they saw fit to roast it. If they did want to note the level of roast - which has little to no relevance when the profile is accurately described for consumers - they should use more universal terms to describe roast development. Again, I would rather see such things removed.Anyway, about that ""medium"" roast - whatever that means. I would have called it more of a ""full city"" roast: not far enough from ""second crack"" territory for my taste. If I want more smoke on the beans, I'd go to Charbucks, but I don't. I may as well go to McDonald's for coffee. No, I don't like trendy, highly acidic and predominantly citrus profiles, but I think there is some glorious space between that and post second crack. Back to the bar: I have found more and more cases of what seems to be scalded milk or just less cohesion and smoothness overall, in terms of lattes, mochas, etc. I don't know what factors have cause this back-sliding, but I hope they can get it figured out and maybe turn the roaster down a few degrees.Bongo Java was once knocking on the door of the big boys and could have taken things up a notch or two, but instead they remain at a better-than-average level.

But then again, I guess I'm one of those tattooed hipsters myself, so I blend in. Or maybe it's because I don't really expect too much friendliness at the coffee counter, after all, some of us are there trying to wake up in the first place.  But I don't think I've ever encountered anyone working there who was in a grumpier mood than me, and that's a good thing.And the coffee is good. And it's organic and fair trade, too -- a real rarity. Makes you feel good about drinking it.The space is a big old garage that they converted into part coffee roastery, and part coffee hangout. The tables and chairs are mostly funky and mismatched, and sometimes I think I might find my initials carved into some old table that maybe came from my old school (which of course, it wouldn't have since I just moved to Nashville, but hey, it's like old school furniture).I can't really attest to their fancy drinks, since I'm sort of a purist. I learned long ago that it's waaaaay cheaper to just order a regular cup of coffee and put your own danged milk in it, and I don't like sweet drinks, so you won't catch me drinking some kind of frothy mocha thingie with whipped cream on it and an extra shot.What I want is quality fresh strong coffee, and that's what they have. They also have some simple sandwich-and-muffin-type food, and I always order the Fishy Bomb, which is your basic bagel and lox, which is the perfect food to eat with a cup of hot strong coffee.  It's not that cheap, but it's plenty good.There is free wireless and always lots of people making use of it. And the art on the walls changes often. And I find the people who work there are just fine. In fact, they're friendly and efficient, though yeah, it's a hipster kind of place, that's the nature of the neighborhood.

"107 S 11th StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"If you like good coffee, don't bother with this place. Burnt coffee smell, combined with burnt coffee taste is probably not even the worst of it. I was in East Nashville for the month of November 2008, staying not to far from this joint... My usual drink that I order anywhere, is a strong americano. In a new place, I'll usually say ""extra room"" (for cream) so I know I'll get a strong cup. Well it irritated me when I would say this to the cashier, and it was not repeated to the barista, but when I got into the habit of saying (loudly) ""extra, EXTRA room please"", and every time getting an overflowing cup. The very last chance I gave them for my business was when I went in there about 20 minutes before they were closing (there was about 10 people sitting drinking coffee etc...), staff was mopping the floor in front of the cash machine, I was about to utter the words ""Americano, EXTRA EXTRA ROOM"" and when I caught a glimpse of the terrified look on the cashier's face, I realized that they had already cleaned all their espresso machines for the night, and this would be a real pain in the V for him. SO, I said ""oh, you've cleaned all the machines?"" without him having to say it, and I said ""can I just get a regular coffee then?"" He said ""yeah, that'd be a lot easier"". I paid, got a cup, and helped myself to some lukewarm, burnt coffee. After this fifth time of giving extreme mediocrity a chance, and paying for terrible coffee and nonchalant service, I discovered a delicious coffee place about a 5 minute drive away, Crema. If you like good coffee, look em up and go there. I don't want this bad review to become an advertisement for another place, but they REALLY have their shiz together there! And a better vibe.

My wife and I came in after the lunch hour, about 2 PM. I ordered the gyros platter and my wife got a plain cheeseburger. The gyros were quite good, seasoned well and with a healthy portion of meat inside the pita. The tzatziki sauce was about average, but gave that fresh zing that one wants when biting into gyros. I've eaten gyros in places with well-established Greek communities (Chicago, New York City, Tampa) so my bar is set pretty high and Opa's more than passes.My wife's cheeseburger seemed to be decent, based on the bite I took, but admittedly due to her accidentally putting barbecue sauce instead of ketchup on it, it was hard to say for sure. It wasn't dry, but it also didn't seem very juicy. What she and I both agree on is that the best part of our meal was the hand-cut French fries - crispy on the outside, melt-in-your mouth soft on the inside, and salted with some coarse sea salt. They were delicious!The only part of our visit we did not enjoy was the very loud country music station being piped in, both in the restaurant and to the outside seating.

I was asked if I wanted sweet potato fries or curly fries, which is always a no brainer. I ordered the fried egg burger and curly fries which were delivered pretty quickly. The portions are huge!!! The burger is a pretty good size and the plate was overflowing with fries. The burger wasn't anything special and sadly the egg didn't save it.

I had called a couple of bars and no one seemed to have the Eagles game on any of their TVA. Finally I remembered passing three stones pub not fair from my apartment. I called and he said that TVA were first come first serve and they had a couple open at the moment. Score!! Since I only live a few minutes away I knew I had it made. Made my way to three stones. The first Sunday the Titans were also playing the earlier game so there was a nice crowd of regulars rooting for the home team. Bill the bartender, who is a great bartender despite his unfortunate taste in football teams, he's a Giants fan, set me up at a little table directly across from a TV set to my Birds. I have since been back every weekend I'm in town and we play Sunday afternoon. And every time has been a great experience, three stones totally reminds me of the neighborhood bars I grew up in in suburban Philadelphia. Plus they have both Cider on tap and Yuengling. When the birds are struggling I switch to the home state beer hoping that turns it around. You've seen the commercial.. It's only weird if it doesn't work. The food is typical bar food but pretty yummy. The burger was a little dry but their wings are exceptional. Personal preference here; but I get annoyed when people don't have regular fries.

The menu is Italian... but they have a weekly margarita night?  They advertise live music, but we were caught off guard by the (way too) loud bluegrass band basically playing the ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" soundtrack.  The number of contradictions this place has to offer is hilarious.  Wine selection wasn't great for a place that calls themselves a wine bar, but they do have wine (a red and a white) made specifically for them by Arrington Vineyards and only available there... except they were out of the red when we tried to order it.

The basics are these: Dan and the gf have a ""solo"" Mac and Cheese business. That'a all they do. Mac and Cheese at 4 different flavors that you buy frozen and bake at home. Some of their M&C can be served cold (like a pasta salad) but most of their stuff (well, the remaining 3 anyway) are served like a traditional M&C. The best one, hands down, is the Mac Attack (bowtie pasta, sausage, red peppers, onions, 4 cheeses and bread crumbs).

I want to say that I have the balls to handle most spicy Thai foods and ethnic cuisine pretty well, yet this dish was a greater challenge than most. The sausage is hand-made with tons of habanero peppers and garlic and i'm sure the cheese sauce has added spice to it too. If you feel like pranking a friend, serve them the dish and remove any drinks from their vicinity... they might try to kill you.Blazing hot tongues aside, the cheese is creamy, the pasta isn't overcooked and the crunchy topping makes your box of Kraft Mac and Cheese seem ghetto as hell.

"209 10th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"So, I work in Cummins Station: which means this is one of 5 lunch options for me in the very near vicinity. I tend to favor M Cafe over anything else. I've been going for over a year, and have had a good selection of their food. Let's start with breakfast: I'm mostly a breakfast wrap kinda girl, because they're $4, made on the spot (which means it takes a few minutes -- sometimes it takes more than a few minutes, if there's more than 2 people in line for breakfast, I just go somewhere else.) Note: when they were $3, they were the best deal in the whole building. Now they're just a good option. I've also had the pancakes, which were delicious, the syrup that they sell in store is actually delicious. I love their mixed berry smoothie. For lunch, I've yet to have something I didn't like: their grilled cheese (comes with bacon + jalapeno-peach jam?: nice combo, sweet and salty and delicious) the chipped beef, which smells like heaven and tastes amazing, I'm a big fan of their Southwest chicken wrap, which seems to come on different flavored wraps depending on what they have. I've also had the Sunshine BLT wrap, the chicken pita, and various other specials -- all have been lovely. When their soups have peeked my interest, they've been delicious. The sandwiches range in price from $6-9. I do think this tends to be a little expensive, but they do have a rewards system in place, which I guess softens the blow. I tend not to eat their cold sandwiches, don't know why. Their cold case salads seem a little underwhelming/weird to me. The desserts, btw, tend to be fairly heavenly, so don't be afraid to indulge yourself if you see something that might peek your interest. The coconut cake they make occasionally is something of a dream. The staff has always been very nice to me -- exceedingly nice, actually.

"3431 Murphy RdNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"When we moved across town, I was delighted to discover this little coffee shop. It is ridiculously close to our house, and even on super-trafficy weekday mornings, it's not impossible to get in and out of the parking lot.The ambiance is nice with adequate seating. I often see folks typing away on their laptops, or conducting small meetings. Seems like a great place for both.While I am a proud owner of a very nice burr grinder, I do not feel that I am a ""coffee snob"" since there is so much to know and learn when it comes to harvesting these little beans that bring me sheer happiness. However, I have found that a can of store-bought-whatever does not suit my taste, but the house coffee Dose serves is quite good.With a strong focus in organic and fair-trade coffees, farm-to-table food, freshly baked goods, all the way to their compostable containers, Dose wins over my heart in multiple arenas. (And I agree, the zucchini muffin is delicious!)Unfortunately, there are a few things that have prevented my rating going beyond three stars.By no means is the staff rude, but they're not overwhelmingly friendly either. If I were in, let's say...Seattle, I would expect this (unless the sun is shining...ha). Here in the South, a little Southern charm is somewhat expected, and goes a long way when you have yet to sip your ""good morning glory"".I'll admit, I'm with my fellow Yelper in that I also subscribe to the international green mermaid chain; partly because I occasionally like to get a little frisky with my coffee by adding some flavor. Unfortunately, the last time I inquired about this at Dose, the syrup selection was quite limited (two of the four offered would literally send me to the infirmary). And while it was not the actual verbal response to my syrup inquiry, it did strongly imply, ""Why would you ruin perfectly good coffee with syrup?"" It was rather off-putting.The other part to my green mermaid willingness is efficiency. Typically they run like well-oiled machines. Dose has not done so well in this area - although there has been some improvement in getting handmade beverages out quicker in my recent visits.Note - I said beverages.Their breakfast sandwiches are truly splendid, but the time it takes to get one feels a bit excessive. Yes, one does need to take into consideration that these sandwiches are not frozen, pre-packaged garbage, so some time needs to be allotted for construction of such deliciousness...Even with this in mind - it still is a bit of a wait.Unfortunately, the last two sandwiches I ordered were prepared incorrectly. On the first, the avocado (the ingredient I was most looking forward to) was missing, and I didn't know it until I returned home. The second one I caught while still on site. It had been prepared with meat that I did not order. So I had to wait again for it to be corrected. One of the owners apologized, and gave me a card to redeem for a free drink - which was very nice of him.I know these folks are serious about their craft, and applaud them for such.

The baristas really seem to know about the coffee they have, and I've been really pleased when I've bought coffee there before.

Of note: they sell bagels from Bagel Face Bakery, which has *vegan* bagels and almost all the bagels they sell (I think all of them actually) are listed on Bagel Face's website as being their vegan bagels. Dose should really play this up. I told the barista working there one day, but I don't know whether she passed on this info or not. Unfortunately, although they have some amazing jams, they only serve real butter and cream cheese, so vegans would be limited spread-wise to jelly and nut butter. (If they stocked some Tofutti cream cheese and Earth Balance, I have plenty of friends who'd turn out for the dairy-free offerings.)I've found most Dose patrons to be really friendly, which is great when seating is limited.

She got a citrus cardamom cookie, which was excellent and citrusy but the cardamom component was negligible (embrace the cardamom!!!). They have Bongo coffee which is always good. Now for the non-food review: As far as ambience goes, the place was packed at 6 and I felt pretty damn agoraphobic inside. Fortunately it was nice out, so we were able to go outside and sit on the patio. One of the design flaws in this place: you pick up your food in the same tiny space where you place your order. So it's always a clusterf**k there. Besides that, the woman in charge of notifying patrons when their order was ready basically screamed names which was rather jarring. If I never hear my name yelled like that again, I'll be happy.I plan to try it again in the next couple weeks and hope to end up with a tastier wrap or sandwich. But I'd suggest going not at peak hours if you want to enjoy yourself.",Grins Vegetarian Cafe,6153228571.0,147.0,2011-04-23,"Louisville, KY",/biz/grins-vegetarian-cafe-nashville,3.0,28,"Washington, DC",Amanda A.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,38.254237599999996,-85.759407,474.1990768248562,False,1301.0,3.75,5.0,3.7037037037037037
"2421 Vanderbilt PlNashville, TN 37212",4.0,"I know, it seems a little strange to write a review for an on-campus college dining option, but I think it surprisingly measures up to the real world.  As a Vanderbilt alum, I was a huge fan of Grins during my undergraduate years--it's a great deal and offers some healthy, delicious alternatives to what you usually think of as campus food.  The menu is entirely vegetarian, and also offers plenty of vegan options.The regulars on the menu include a variety of hefty wraps and sides. I would highly recommend the toasted Apple Wrap - sweet, cinnamon, cooked apples, peanut butter, granola, and vanilla yogurt on the side to dip into.  I'm actually allergic to raw apples, so I love that they cook the apples.  The granola adds a nice crunchiness and I mean, when wouldn't you want to eat peanut butter? It's a great simple combination.  Others tell me the PB&G is great too (peanut butter, bananas, and granola) but I'm turned off by the bananas. The Mexicali wrap is alright, it's mostly just rice and beans (a lot of it though).  I can only tolerate eating it if I also add cheese to the wrap--otherwise it's overwhelmingly plain and reminiscent of what we used to serve at Hunger Banquets.They also have a rotating pasta, panini, and soup of the day.  I've never tried their pastas, but the panini's have never let me down.  Last time I was there, they had a delicious focaccia bread with olive tapenade, pesto, ricotta, sundried tomatoes, and mozzarella. Yum. And they're made fresh-to-order. I can't remember the names of the other panini's, but I can attest that I definitely order a panini more often than a wrap, and it's always a great combination of flavors that still fills you up.They also have some cool rotating cold sides that vary from an edamame & corn salad to their famous ranch pasta. The flavors are always refreshing and bright and a great complement to their main dishes.Don't go during the lunch rush if you plan on eating...the wait might take 20-30 minutes in line and then you'd still have to wait for your food. But, if you want a nice light dinner or a late lunch, this would be the perfect spot. They aren't especially quick--small kitchen--but, it's a great light, refreshing, vegetarian dining option. Also they have an extremely inefficient way of calling orders out to you. In theory, they scream your name when your order is up. But, this leads to confusion when common names are dining at the same hour. Also, there is a lot of space and the volume of the order-calling never reaches past the first few tables or over the chattering of customers in line. So, definitely pay attention after you order so that you don't miss yours being called out! I ended up having to wait over 30 minutes for my order because I didn't hear them call it and apparently someone else took it and then I had to go up and re-order.",Grins Vegetarian Cafe,6153228571.0,310.0,2011-04-04,"San Francisco, CA",/biz/grins-vegetarian-cafe-nashville,4.0,28,"Washington, DC",Jess Y.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,37.7792768,-122.41927040000002,2440.8398793230926,False,2855.0,3.75,5.0,3.7037037037037037

Great variety of dishes with all delicious flavors, their noodle and rice dishes are great. I definitely enjoy going to Kohana with my son because their kids' menu is just great. Really, I mean with a child, it's difficult to feed them something decent because fine dining usually won't have a kids' menu and going to a typical American chain restaurant will get your child served up with disgusting hot dogs, cheese burgers, mac and cheese sorts but Kohana's kids' menu offers variety with fresh ingredients and great taste.

"2002 Richard Jones RdNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"Signs of a bad sushi restaurant - when they use lemon in their chirashi. It's used to hide the mediocre quality of the fish. Looking at the slices of sashimi tuna, I could already tell that they get their fish from the same places asian groceries store get it. It has the pinkish color to it, rather than the deeper red that fresh tuna is supposed to be. The tamago wasn't even sweet. It tasted like a regular omelet. The octopus had a vinegar base to it, another bad sign. The snapper tasted like it was defrosted from a grocery store. Yuck. For $20, this was one of the worse chirashi bowls ever. If you want real sushi/sashimi, go to Ninki instead. If you want dressed up specialty rolls, then I guess this place maybe for you. As a purist sushi lover, I was disappointed. They could not even get the sushi rice right, which is very important. Signs that it's really a quasi-Japanese place - when they are playing Chinese music, thinking that their customers can't tell the difference. (I'm Chinese so I could tell the lyrics were in Chinese).If you're looking for real Japanese ramen, I'd avoid this place as well. There's only one broth and it tasted like soy sauce. I know this because I used soy sauce to put some flavor in it because it was very very bland. No tonkotsu ramen here. It's their own recipe broth I was told, which tasted like water with a hint of beef broth. Sadly, I'm serious. Aside from the horrible food, the service here was friendly. We were seated promptly and our waitress was attentive, hence the additional star, otherwise, this place really deserves a 1. So come here if you don't care if your fish is that fresh.

I sat at the bar so I could watch the Olympics. Business was slow so the staff was crowded around that area doing the same. After I settled into my seat I looked to my right and that's where I began to worry. I was expecting your traditional sushi chef but I was so wrong! There was a white guy and a man of Hispanic decent (not trying to sound racist, he'll I'm black!) dressed is uncoordinated T-shirts and jeans. They each were struggling like they were just thrown into it because the real chef did not show! I gave the sushi a try anyway because I had bough a living social deal soon did not have much to lose. I ordered the futomaki, scallops,  and the kohana. Futomaki was my safe pick along with scallops. I sat there and watched one of the chefs make my scallop sushi TWICE! He had it right the first time: scallop, wasabi, sushi rice, mayor some nori. Then he decided that was wrong and disassembled my sushi proceeded too mince my scallops and add mayo and some roe! WTF! I tried it and of course it was horrible! My futomaki was good but it was not pretty or cut thick... I expected that with the skill level I saw. The waitress told me the kohana was a good choice; I should have changed my order right then. She was still in training and probably had been trained to say that; too new to have a real opinion. The kohana was supposed to have crawfish, crab, yellowtail, all the good stuff and then it's fried and has yum yum and eel sauce on top. It was fried so hard I had a hard time chewing it! I tasted nothing but sauce and avocado. My waitress did not check on me after I started eating even though she was a few stools down from me. She finally noticed I was watching the Olympics and not eating. She asked if I needed anything else or a to-go box. I told her no that I didn't like the food. She took my food and said ""I'm sorry about that"" and proceeded to walk away. I said it was okay to be nice but no one really seemed to care.

"2002 Richard Jones RdNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I recently moved to Green Hills (as in 2 weeks ago) and had noticed that soon there would be Sushi literally out my front door.  So every day for 2 weeks I've watched and waited on Kohana to open.  Yesterday, to my complete surprise, as I'm driving with no intention whatsoever of eating Sushi I see the hanging the ""NOW OPEN"" banner on the front.  I almost wrecked as I swerved into the parking lot (which was completely full already, they'd been open an hour) seemingly unable to satisfy this curiosity fast enough.When I entered I found an extremely polite and friendly staff (I don't use extremely polite very often, I've worked in the service industry and I'm on the road a lot performing and encounter numerous bars and restaurants all the time, these people were EXTREMELY polite).  The decor in this joint has just the right modern feel you'd expect out of a high-end Sushi spot without being over the top.  It was a very comfortable setting.I sat at the Sushi bar, where I was greeted by 3, yes 3 Sisters, all of whom couldn't have been sweeter.  One of the sisters was running the show while the other two cranked out some of the best and most unique sushi I've experienced.  My server, Alex, more than compensated for my dehydration from a night of drinking.  I simply told her just that as I sat down and she never let my glass get even close to empty.  It's the little things that count.The Phoenix Roll ($16) is worth every penny.  It is 12-14 pieces (I got so full I lost count) and it may be the tastiest roll to ever cross your pallet.  Prior to eating it, of course I had to try my go to, the spicy tuna roll ($5) just to make sure that this dream of 30 steps to sushi was for real.  It was also delicious, nothing crazy, nothing wild, just what you want to get the job done.  There are many items priced under $10 that are extremely yummy.  You will realize this once you pick up their ""Hardcover Magazine Style Photo Album"" of their dishes.I've never written a single Yelp review and may never write another.  As I was browsing Yelp for bars around me I've yet to experience I noticed that Kohana wasn't on the list yet and after the experience I had yesterday, from the food, the Sisters, Alex, the comfy orange chairs, and on and on, made me realize that if I didn't make an account and tell people how good this place is I would be a poor excuse of a human.  Do yourself a favor and check them out.  It will change your (sushi) life.~Chad",Kohana Japanese Restaurant,6159152415.0,4.0,2012-06-17,"Cincinnati, OH",/biz/kohana-japanese-restaurant-nashville,5.0,45,"Washington, DC",Chad D.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,39.1014537,-84.5124602,402.5502918458391,False,2478.0,3.3777777777777778,3.3333333333333335,3.380952380952381

"2002 Richard Jones RdNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"Food- I ordered the chicken teriyaki because I wasn't in the mood for sushi and it was anything but what I expected- ickk! It came with miso soup (which was delicious, better than any I've ever had) and a salad, which was okay. BUT the chicken teriyaki was pretty bad. I was served two long, thin chicken breasts with teriyaki sauce dumped in the middle with a scoop of white rice, an apple piece, an orange piece, a seaweed cucumber mix and two spears of broccoli. This IS NOT ANYTHING like hibachi, so don't order it expecting hibachi. My chicken wasn't even cut into strips. It looked like a plain, bland chicken breast with teryiaki sauce dumped on top, and it tasted even worse. Not to mention, my second chicken breast had a medium sized dark spot in the middle, so I didn't touch it. In their defense, the portions were HUGE. For $9, I got enough food to feed two people. My friend ordered two sushi rolls, and the fish looked very fresh. Granted, it wasn't the best sushi I've ever tasted, but it certainly was fresh. On a side note, if you're a sashimi fan, I bet they have great sashimi. Price- One reason I didn't order a specialty roll is because most of them are $15. If I recall correctly, they're all in the $14-$18 range, which is pretty steep for a lunch roll. You might as well go to Virago and sit on their cool patio and eat for that price. There are SEVERAL rolls that are in the $6-$12 range, they just are the blander, simpler rolls that I personally don't care for. But, if you like these types of rolls, you'd probably be pretty impressed. Service- was spotty and awkward.

Our server was polite, but our interactions were somewhat uncomfortable. However, I did notice that the owner of the restaurant was very interactive with her customers.

"2002 Richard Jones RdNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I've spent about a third of my life in Japan, so when I get a ""jones"" for sushi I really want sushi. I was extremely excited to see a new sushi restaurant opening near my business office, particularly after checking the reviews for Kohana in Hendersonville and Clarksville. My wife and I went with great expectations.Let me start by saying that the restaurant's only been open a little while. Still, our waiter told us the owners had ""imported"" staff and chefs from the other restaurants, so the recent opening is no excuse.We arrived the first time just after dinner hour opening, were greeted and seated by a friendly hostess. When we got up to look at the sushi bar, the sushi chef behind it couldn't be bothered to look up and greet us - not even make eye contact. We stood there awkwardly for a minute, then returned to the table.We ordered age dashi tofu, which arrived in a huge mound of slightly-warm tofu with a dash - really, just a dash - of sauce. Nothing else on it. When we asked the waiter where the grated daikon the menu promised was, he checked with the chef, then came back to say ""Chef says they've never, ever made it that way, he doesn't understand why it says that on the menu."" The tofu was mealy, the sauce was forgettable, and without the grated vegetables, disappointing.We ordered the gyoza, which were actually quite good - not fried to death like so many other restaurants. Reminiscent of the old Shintomi when it was still the best in this area. However, the gyoza sauce tasted like someone had thrown a batch of vinegar into a bowl, splashed a teaspoon of soy sauce, and forgotten any other ingredients.(As an aside, until it went fervently downill my wife and daughters and I ate at Shintomi at least twice a week for years. They had the best gyoza sauce I've ever eaten, including in Tokyo!)We loved the beautiful picture menu of sushi rolls. My wife adores crab, and was excited to see that certain rolls specified ""crabstick"" (surimi - imitation crab), while another specified ""snow crab."" Since she is allergic to imitation crab, she happily ordered the roll made with ""snow crab."" Ordinarily, if a restaurant lists the two differently, we don't double check, but the prior two dishes made me nervous, so I asked the waiter whether it was in fact real snow crab. ""Oh, no. ALL our crab is imitation crabstick."" What? Really?! With snow crab cheap enough that Denny's features it, you're substituting surimi? Yes. Fake crab. In a restaurant charging $14-$18 a roll!Well, we cancelled the roll and moved on. I ordered ikura sushi, one of my personal tests of a good Japanese restaurant, along with seaweed salad. The salad was delicious. The ikura was embarrassingly bad. I would expect to see it at an all-you-can-eat sushi buffet.Thinking perhaps a non-Japanese item would fare better, we ordered the calimari. Delicious.I went back for lunch a few days later, and again asked about the crab, and was told the same thing. When I asked why the three menus at dinner and lunch differentiated between ""snow crab"" ""crab stick"" and ""imitation crab"", the waiter just shrugged.If you want good Japanese food in Nashville, without the health complications of a corporate entity that cheaps out where it counts (and don't think the imitation crab rolls are inexpensive!), go to Midori. It's a bit of a hike, but the sushi's always good, and their Korean food is excellent. Or go to Koto, sometimes hit or miss but usually very good. Or try Miyako. Or even Hanabi, which has begun to slide but is still way more than decent.

The capers were squirted onto the sandwich so that they were really dense in one area and no where to be found on the rest of the sandwich. The red onion on it was from the outer, coarse layer of an onion that I usually throw away because of the texture. The sandwich also took about 6 minutes to construct-- it shouldn't be that challenging.

We come here every Friday night and we haven't found a reason yet to break tradition.The food is outstanding - probably the best Mexican I've found in town. One member of our group claims it's the best he's ever had, but - as a Texan - I can't endorse that opinion. By this point, I've tried most of the menu. Nothing has disappointed yet.For the hungry - I recommend the fajita quesadilla. It's a huge, well stuffed quesadilla that always satisfies. Or for the timid, feel free to split it into two meals.For the budget conscious - go for the chicken tacos. Though it's an appetizer, I've had this as my meal several times. $5 for a huge plate of chicken nachos that is never easy to finish.And fulfilling a major requirement of Mexican restaurants, the margaritas are great too. A few pitchers around the table works every time.If there's a downside, it's the service. They're not terribly fast, and they get orders wrong with surprising frequency; though, they're pretty quick with chips and salsa refills, which helps alleviate the long wait for food.

I told her that all I wanted was a cheese dip & salsa. She then stared at me with a rude look on her face & rang it up again.

Everyone who eats at mexican restaurants knows that if you get a cheese dip you go through at LEAST 3 baskets of chips. Well, she glared at me & said no you cannot. I looked at her & then at the manager next to her. I pulled out the half filled bag of chips & said "" I paid almost 6 dollars for a cheese dip & I'm not leaving until I get another bag of flipping chips "" well the manager then said to her, in Spanish, "" give her another bag "" & I guess he assumed since I'm American I don't speak Spanish.

"3415 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.5,"I was guilty of judging a book by its cover. As my friends pulled up to the swingingly seventies building that houses Woodlands, I was looking for the escape cord. 'No way,' I thought. Had I left things there, I would have missed out on some very tasty grub. There's a reason why the dining room was packed for an early-ish dinner on a Thursday evening. People looking for affordable vegetarain Indian fare know where to come. Here. They come here. The dining room won't win any HGTV contests. It's very very red. The color red usually agitates me so I willed myself to go into a Zen-like state. This was helped by the chai tea I ordered. This was so so much better than anything a green mermaid could dream up. Despite the tea being hot and me ordering the drink during summer, I had to stop myself from gulping it all down at once. Mmm, cardamom... Chillaxed from my beverage, it was time to order. One of the great things about ordering Indian food in a group is the opportunity to try a lot of things at once. Despite this being (I think) a south Indian restaurant, I didn't opt for a dosa. I'm pretty particular when it comes to dosa and had to test the waters before jumping in. I'm fairly certain that I'll be ordering dosa upon my next visit. The food was really tasty. With copious amounts of steamed basmati rice and garlic naan at the ready, we jumped in to the ordering pool and came out happier people. My entry in to the food goodness was the coconut curry. I know it doesn't sound adventurous but who needs adventure when there's cauliflower, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and potatoes to be had? The curry milk broth wasn't too soupy and the consistency allowed the vegetables to shine, rather than be drowned in the mix. The baingan bartha and malai kofta were big hits as well. Don't be deceived by the metal bowls in which the food comes. Between 3 adults and one child, we couldn't finish four entrees (with naan and rice and raita). I know! I was surprised, too. Our server seemed mildly humored by our fear of a spice planet and he was very friendly and helpful during our meal. I left Woodlands understanding why it has such a fiercely loyal following.

Hard to find unless you know that and eyeball your gps like crazy. We had to turn around the first time. Anyway we went for dinner with a couple out of town friends last night. My husband and I ordered the vegetable pakora appetizer to start. It was really so good. I liked both the tamarind sauce and the mint chutney sauces that came with the appetizer too. Hubs ordered the vegetable jalfrezi and added paneer, and I ordered the mysore masala dosa. He said he loved his as much, maybe more than our favorite Indian place back home. I had never tried dosa before and I'll admit it was a toss up between that and the palak paneer. I almost always order spinach at Indian restaurants because I love it so much, but I decided to try something new. The dosa itself was fine. Nothing mind blowing, but okay. The actual filling was so good but there was SO little of it! My friend ordered a dosa as well and hers came wrapped up like 3 fat burritos with a ton of filling.

I do not know the names of most of the specialty dishes, but I can certainly point at the pictures on the menu and tell you which ones (all of them) are good.  There is just something about their simple, staple and humble ingredients that makes me find comfort and familiarity in each dish. It's rice, legumes, and vegetables...highly spiced to make the most out of them - that's it. Oh, before I forget, Woodlands is closed on Mondays! (Just didn't want you to drive all the way there and be disappointed).Their buffets are excellent. Lunch is served 11 am - 2 pm...$8.99. The buffets consist of a variety of several different kinds of soups, salads, curries, rice, desserts, and breads.  A great appetizer: Samosas are delicious especially with the variety of chutneys it's served with (tamarind and mint). My favorite dish is the Rava Masala Dosa. It's a crepe filled with spicy potatoes and vegetables. It's crispy on the edges yet soft and tasty on the inside! The Vegetable biriyani and Ghanna baturo (big fluffy bread served with chickpeas masala) are also delish! If you order a la carte,  I recommend to order several different dishes then share with the other guests on your table because the portions are quite generous....but if you want to be greedy and not share, then I hope you really like your entree and don't choke!

"3415 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.5,"OK, so positive reviews of Woodlands from meat-eaters inevitably follow a simple format:1) State that you're ""not all that into"" vegetarian cuisine, or that you were ""never that into it,"" or that you're just generally way into meat and the day really isn't complete unless you've messily devoured an entire suckling pig or something. Bonus points if you broadcast the fact that your horrible vegetarian friends dragged you here.2) Describe in lavish detail the specific dishes that convinced you that Woodlands is, in fact, a wonderful place to dine, and rhapsodize about how your meal was in no way diminished by not having fragments of selected animal carcasses lurking within it.3) Complete your conversion narrative! Lord, lord almighty, you have seen the light!So yeah, I'm not a vegetarian either, so I guess I'll quit making fun of you now. The reason that Woodlands is so awesome is twofold: first, they have a huge and intimidating menu with everything you could possibly want on it. The descriptions are cryptic, many of them are strongly similar, and you'll find yourself wondering about what will actually come out of the kitchen. I ordered puri there once because I was in the mood for something lighter, and they served me an enormous puffy bread somewhat larger than a football that I cautiously prodded with my knife for fear that it might emit some sort of hazardous spume (spoiler alert: it did not). Second, everything is fantastically prepared, reasonably priced, and very very tasty. The curries with almonds and/or cashews are my favorite--nutty and spicy.OK, so I lied: the reasons are actually threefold--it's also BYOB. Thus, your dinner can be as fancy as you want it to be. Feel like a night on the town? Bust out that bottle of Dom. Want to slum it with your hipster friends? Bring a suitcase of PBR (unless, of course, PBR has been supplanted as the crappy beer du jour, in which case bring along your Genesee or Natty Ice or Night Train or whatever swill the youngsters are drinking these days).Finally, some superlatives: this is most definitely the best Indian food in Nashville.

I would say once you come more regular they get to know you and the service improves somewhat. Give it a chance this is a busy place and the employees are really hardworking and good people.Another thing I tell my friends is to remember this is South Indian cuisine, please do not come in here and start ordering like you are at Bombay Palace or probably every other typical indian restaurant you have been too. There's more to it than just the curries and naan. Be prepared to use your hands.You are coming here for the Dosa. If you know nothing about Dosa, order the Masala Dosa. Most non-indian people don't really know how to eat it. It comes out looking like a huge crepe with potato in the center. What you do is tear off a piece of the dosa, pick up a small amount of potato, then using your hand dip this in the sambar (that's the soup looking stuff it came with) then before taking a bite dip it again in the coconut chutney, then eat it. If you don't foodgasm from the flavor sensation in your mouth, you somehow did it wrong. I may start giving lessons.Another must is the gobi manchurian dry, which is an appetizer. I don't know what is possibly indian about this dish, but its better than crack and you must order it. It's a Large portion, more than enough for 2 people.I also recommend the samosa chaat. Very tasty and generous portion.If you are still unsure and intimidated, go for the lunch buffet. You will experience so much of the menu and you won't have to think.

Garlic naan, $3.  This was a good naan.  Some places give you garlic naan with burned garlic on it, or (at the other end of the spectrum) too-raw garlic.  This one was balanced, not burned, nor raw.  Served with a small container of raita.2. Rasam (thali).  Delicious spicy tomato soup!  Very good.3. Sambar (thali).  Very good!  Honestly, and this is kind of sad, I couldn't quite tell the difference from the rasam.  I really liked both, though!4. Samosa (thali).  Very good!  Two samosas with green sauce (cilantro/mint?) and a sweet red sauce (tamarind?).  The sauces were excellent.  The samosa pastry was nice and flaky, slightly oily, but not overly so.5. Chapati (thali).  Very good, but not what I was expecting.  Usually when I get chapati, it's a brown (whole wheat) bread, and a bit thicker than this one. This one was a yellow color, and thin like a crepe.6. Vegetable pulav/biryani (thali).  Very good!  Some saffron, some turmeric, some rehydrated dried fruits (raisins?), some nuts.  Nicely balanced.7. Dal (thali).  Very good!8. Curried green beans (thali).  Good!  Slightly salty, but good.9. Curried chickpeas (thali).  Very good!10. Papad (thali).  Umm.  I was so full I didn't try this until the next day, and so it had become soggy.  Seemed ok, although it didn't look like the papadams I usually get in Indian places.  Was more of a uniform brown color rather than the more yellowish speckled with black that I'm used to.  I think the taste was a bit blander than what I'm used to also.  Not bad or anything, but different.11. Indian tea (masala chai) (thali).  Good!  Didn't seem to have much (any?) sugar in it, which is fine.  I'd rather add sugar to taste than get a super-sweet tea, although I didn't bother adding sugar to this one.  It was pretty good already, and I was too busy eating!12. Carrot dessert (carrot halwa?) (thali).  Pretty good, a bit too sweet for my taste, but nice overall.13. Mango lassi, $3.50 ($1 if added to thali).  Excellent!  Not one of those disgusting glow-in-the-dark orange artificially-colored/flavored mango lassis.`14. Masala dosa (thali).  Pretty good!  Not too oily.Menu prices on their website are slightly out of date as of today (3/14/2012).Overall: Solid Indian food, all vegetarian, they also advertise that they have vegan options.  Very veg*n-friendly!  Note they're closed Mondays!  I may have spent $18 on my thali, but it was so much food, that I had more than enough for lunch the next day, so the value is pretty good.Service: Good, friendly, prompt.Ambience: Nice Indian decor.Location: Inside hotel, but visible from the street if you look carefully.  (Sorry, forgot the name of the hotel).Parking: Some parking in the lot in the front, also in the back..",Woodlands Indian Vegetarian Cuisine,6154633005.0,317.0,2012-03-14,"Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA",/biz/woodlands-indian-vegetarian-cuisine-nashville,4.0,232,"Washington, DC",Michelle T.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,,,,False,3246.0,4.327586206896552,4.5,4.326086956521739

"3415 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.5,"Based on another yelper's suggestion (Peter K) I came back here... I had originally planned on going back a few weeks ago, but New York and life got in the way... so it did not happen until the 9th of November.  I got in about 1:15 for the buffet.I had Medhu Vada (fried lentil doughnut), onion rings, Veggie Pulav (rice with spice), Coconut rice, Rajma Palek (I believe it was chopped spinach and something chewy), Dal Tadka (yellow lentils, onion and tomato) Paratha bread and a salad.The place has done some cosmetic updates since the last time I was there, quite a bit nicer than it was.  It reminded me much less of a meeting room that had been converted to a restaurant, and quite a bit more like a restaurant.  They did a good job on that.The fried lentil doughnut I got was cold, I am not sure if it was supposed to be room temperature or not, it tasted like moist crumbling bread with a slightly acidic taste.  The onion rings were room temp as well, non-crispy outside breading, but the flavor of the onion was quite striking.  Not something I would eat much of but a nice flavor.The veggie pulav was good, it was a little spicy (I think, had things all mixed up at one point or another) the Dal Tadka lentil concoction was good, but did not pop.  The paratha bread I imagine is good when it's warmer, but it was cold.One of the dishes had suffered a salt overload (I think the cook must have dumped some in the side) so every third or fourth bite was a ton of salt. I do not think this was standard or intentional.The potato pancake appeared later, somehow it always appears when you've had too much food and want to stop.  I don't particularly like the potato pancake, but I do not think that is limited to woodlands.  It was good, as far as unrequested potato pancakes go.The salad.  It may just be that this is the style, but it's the same thing I've always disliked about woodland's... the lettuce tastes like it's ... I don't know, it's not wilted yet, but it's not crisp... the corn in the salad was kind of sweet but tasted a little like it had been boiled and then frozen for a while.  The short of it is I did not like the buffet salad.This particular round on the buffet I was not as disappointed as I've been.  The atmosphere has been upgraded, the food was a little spicier.  I still don't hate the place, but it's really not for me... the buffet seems to lack (at 1:15 on a random Tuesday).For my call-out from Peter K (who also convinced me to go back) I did a quick survey of the ethnicity of the customers, when I went there were no Indian customers, but perhaps that's just because it was 1pm.  2 white people in front of me, behind and to the left.  fairly unpacked at 1:15.I will stand by my original review of the buffet, this style may appeal to you, it may be authentic, but for flavor explosions that appeal to my pallet I go elsewhere.  Your mileage may vary, you will not hate this restaurant and it may be for you.

"3415 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.5,"Possibly the best Indian restaurant and the best vegetarian restaurant in Tennessee! For those who are unfamiliar with southern Indian cuisine, and even for those who are, the lunch buffet ($8.99, seven days a week) is a fantastic value for the wallet and even better treat for the belly. There are salads and fruits, cold yogurts, sauces, two soups, two desserts, breads, and a handful of different hot dishes, many of which go beyond the normal samosa and curry. Just when you think you've loaded up on the yummy food, the waiter will bring out a fresh dosa for each person at the table - it's like a crepe, with a small stuffing of potato inside. The only problem is wishing you had more room in your stomach! Dinner service (yes, I've been here multiple times) is refined and elegant, yet very affordable, and just as delicious as the buffet. There is a side room that can accommodate large parties.Service is also wonderful, with pleasant and responsive wait staff. The biggest complaint (and it's not very big) is some people find the location more difficult to see the first time, as it is on the ground floor of a condo building, but it's definitely not hard to get to, right off I-440, minutes from Vanderbilt, Belle Meade, and even downtown, well worth the trip, even if it takes waiting for the MTA buses that run down West End!",Woodlands Indian Vegetarian Cuisine,6154633005.0,115.0,2012-08-01,"Casselberry, FL",/biz/woodlands-indian-vegetarian-cuisine-nashville,5.0,232,"Washington, DC",Em S.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,28.654276,-81.32379065,747.4389697966677,False,1339.0,4.327586206896552,4.5,4.326086956521739
"3415 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.5,"So I came out last year. Well, more the fact of meat out, veggies and fish in. After years of dithering, I realised that I simply had to be true to myself and reject that, that wasn't. I'm four weeks in and I am wondering if I am breaking. Mainly because I am on a work trip to the south and have discovered that I can eat bugger all. I may have built up my own body weight in heavy metal from all the fish I have eaten due to the utter lack of vegetarian options on most menus, and when there are hundreds of meat-based options, I feel like I am wavering, just to get some damn choice. One of things I hadn't attempted since my conversion was to try out a vegetarian restaurant. Don't ask me why - but something scared me about such places. But tonight, faced with yet another night of optionless meals, I went for it and yelped Nashville for vegetarian options - and Woodlands came up. First up was a vegetable samosa platter - essentially, unlike the samosas I have had in the past, these were slices of vegetables fried in a thick almost-pastry like batter. A little dry and heavy for my tastes and overall, rather tasteless, with sauces that neither complimented nor provided detriment to them. Then I had the Bombay Bhaji - mooshed up vegetables, with rice, mango chutney and a lemon raita. Bonus points - my server asked what spice level I wanted - honestly it was a bit too spicy for me, but if I go again, I will know to ask for a more mild version. So at a guess I would say in my veggie mash there was tomatoes, onion, non-mooshed peas and potato - anything else, I couldn't tell you - but it did taste cliantro/spicy infused goodness. The lemon raita was a great addition, but the mango chutney was way too bitter for my tastes. The bhaji was also perfect for naan-dipping - which was a little over toasted and not as fluffy as I would like. Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Woodlands - although I would say that a lot of the meals were centred around potatoes more than I would like. And it was nice to be absolutely spoiled for choice rather than scrabbling desperately around for a change.",Woodlands Indian Vegetarian Cuisine,6154633005.0,691.0,2010-01-20,"Musselburgh, United Kingdom",/biz/woodlands-indian-vegetarian-cuisine-nashville,4.0,232,"Washington, DC",Catriona C.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,55.942120200000005,-3.0538515999999998,3475.5133588651747,False,2101.0,4.327586206896552,4.5,4.326086956521739
"3415 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.5,"It's not like this place really needs another 5-star review, since they've got so many already, but they deserve it so I'm giving it to them anyway!It used to be that Nashville had few decent Indian options, but with Woodlands and Bombay Palace, you've pretty much got all you need. Woolands focuses on Southern Indian food, which tends to be vegetarian, and as such the restaurant sticks to serving up dishes using ingredients that never had a pulse. Bombay Palace does Northern Indian cuisine that tends to be saucier and richer, and yes, involves meat. So if you put these two restaurants in your arsenal, you're all set.I love the 7-day/week buffets at both places, but I admit that when it comes to waiter/table service, I think I prefer Woodlands. The prices are super reasonable, and the menu is so fun. I love the dosas (thin crispy pancakes that are filled with various items... think Indian crepes),  which are potentially worth ordering just for the crave-worthy coconut sauce that accompanies them. Often just the thought of Indian food can make you feel heavy and bogged down, but I never feel anything but pleasantly full after dining at Woodlands. The food is so good that you truly don't miss the meat - my husband is a dedicated and resolute omnivore and even he never passes up a chance to dine here.The staff is always very friendly and helpful and service is speedy. The food is always fresh (even during the buffet) and the cleanliness of the restaurant is top notch (always something I worry about at buffets). Woodlands has recently done some renovations and gussied up the dining room, so it truly is a wonderful place to enjoy a meal. Here's a tip to help you get the most of the experience: Woodlands is BYO, so if you feel like imbibing anything other than kid friendly sodas, mango lassies, or teas/coffees, you can bring your own alcohol of choice with you.",Woodlands Indian Vegetarian Cuisine,6154633005.0,136.0,2011-02-21,"Toronto, Canada",/biz/woodlands-indian-vegetarian-cuisine-nashville,5.0,232,"Washington, DC",Steph H.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,43.6529206,-79.3849008,350.3224729993701,False,1887.0,4.327586206896552,4.5,4.326086956521739

"3415 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.5,"I really wanted to like Woodlands more than I did.  My friends had hyped me up about the food and I love Indian food, so I was so excited to finally make a visit.  But, when it comes down to it, I still prefer Bombay Palace over Woodlands--and I'm not saying this just because I'm an omnivore and appreciate meat, really! (Although, I do enjoy my meat)First off, for those of you who are driving, it's right next to the hotel. But, you do not need to actually enter the hotel to enter the restaurant. My friends and I unfortunately realized this the hard way, when one of them decided to ring the bell for service to enter the hotel.  When we realized that the entrance to the restaurant was just to the left, we quickly sneaked away, hoping not to be noticed.That aside, the lunch buffet is pretty spacious (when you compare it to Bombay Palace--also the space is significantly easier to navigate--Bombay Palace's buffet area is like one small walk-in closet).  There is a good selection of different foods to taste.  The rice was fantastic as was a spinach/cheese dish--one of my favorites.  They also offer dosas, similar to Bombay Palace, which are kind of like crepes with lentil/potato/something-delicious filled inside.  My dining party and I had a whole argument about whether they were filled with lentils or potatoes. I still contend that there were potatoes inside--although, my research on Wiki says that the crepe part does include crushed lentils. Either way, they are delicious.  Unlike Bombay Palace, they also offer Puri which are the really thin, crispy breads.  Side note, I love Indian breads. Also they had some other interesting things like a lentil donut and a sweet cinnamon shredded carrot dessert.They also offered a cauliflower dish that was called a curry, but I'm not sure why. It was pretty amazing how they got the cauliflower to have a meat-like texture, but it created some cognitive conflict in my mouth when it had the exact texture and flavor of General Tso's Chicken. It was bizarre and I'm not sure if that's a good thing.The food is pretty good, but I think Bombay Palace's is better. It just seems more flavorful--maybe that has more to do with the Northern/Southern cuisine differences. I don't know enough about Indian cuisine to decide.

One of my cousins has had bad reactions to the food at some Chinese restaurants, and has theorized MSG was the culprit, if not something else. As a routine, she asks about it in any new restaurants.  As soon as we walked in the door, we asked the host if they used MSG, or any other additives or allergens. He said to steer clear of the Indochina section. Beyond that he wasn't exactly reassuring, and I felt, a bit dismissive. We sat down and ordered drinks. I looked to my left and saw a cockroach on the drapes. Horrified, but not surprised given the type of building Woodlands is in, I let it go because the food is good enough to deal. That and I didn't feel like driving to Sitar. I ordered the chana palak. The spinach was undercooked and I found a bay leaf in it. I also asked for spicy but the dish was bland, so I had to ask for chili on the side. It was disappointing overall and I left most of it on the plate. So the meal was wrapping up and my cousin got up and walked outside. She returned a few minutes later with a look of panic and tears in her eyes and said her throat was closing up. We paid, and explained that she was having a bad reaction to the food. The host looked alarmed, and I hope he remembers what happened. It pays to understand the ingredients your own restaurant works with! Please, do some simple research, so whether it was an additive or a common food allergen, you can know what to tell people who ask about them.

There is way too much starch - even many of the vegetable dishes are very heavy on the potatoes (the vegetable korma resembles coconut and potato soup). Perhaps this is a regional thing but prepare yourself for bread,potatoes, rice, bread, potatoes, rice.....The food quality is good. One compaint would be that a lot of the dishes taste too similar and don't have much character of their own. Very mild for Southern Indian food. Very mild.

I've been a half-dozen times, and it's never disappointed once.There are some staples, like the chana palak, that are consistently awesome. They rotate some things in and out as well.. Last time I was there I had a surprisingly good concoction -- some sort of beet curry. The rasam soup is easily one of my favorites.

Luckily, you can find almost anything with a GPS unit.The ambiance of the restaurant left much to be desired, but it's not meant to be a fine dining experience. It's reminiscent of a dhaba, or roadside restaurant: no-frills dining area, basic tables and chairs, and food served on plates and metal trays.The night we went wasn't busy, which was great for us. Food was reasonably priced and came out quickly and in great portions. I ordered one of the three available combos, which comes with hot tea, hot soup, samosas, ""dosa"" (Indian crepe), and an assortment of vegetarian entrees served with two types of rice. All of it good, all of it filling, since it's mostly carbs you're consuming.They don't serve alcohol, but you're allowed to bring your own, so we had to send someone out for a six-pack.Excellent food, so-so service, hard-to-find location, but overall a good experience.",Woodlands Indian Vegetarian Cuisine,6154633005.0,24.0,2009-04-02,"Quincy, MA",/biz/woodlands-indian-vegetarian-cuisine-nashville,4.0,232,"Washington, DC",Ben M.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,42.25287720000001,-71.0022705,392.8809489083284,False,1505.0,4.327586206896552,4.5,4.326086956521739

I'm sure there are official names for these sauces, but I don't have to know them to like them. The paneer is a traditional spinach and cottage cheese dish that is found at most Indian places, and my wife thought it was very good, but not significantly better than others she's had.In general, this was a very good Indian restaurant that probably wouldn't be the best I've ever had, but was a nice relief from the intense pork and BBQ-themed meals that have dominated our trip to Nashville.

"3415 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.5,"It is so hard to find a good, hearty, affordable and healthy vegetarian meal in Nashville. Woodlands deserves all five stars for that alone. I'm pretty picky about my Indian restaurants, since I can generally get much better at an Indian friend's home. But Woodlands offers (in this ferengi's humble opinion) pretty authentic Southern Indian fare. Warming spices, earthy lentil flour, and tangy chutneys rule the day.On your first trip, the dosa is a must. Basically a crisp and slightly chewy paper-thin pancake rolled around a filling and served with dips. Try the paper masala dosa. As big as yer' head, served with comfortingly perfect potatoes masala, sambar (a savory delicious soup with potatoes and eggplant in broth), and coconut chutney, whose excellence you have to taste to believe.Feeling a bit adventurous? Give pani puri a try. Pani refers to a sweet-tangy-spicy seasoned tamarind water, which you pour into a puri, a hollow fried-crisp round bread filled with potatoes and peas. Before the whole contraption self-destructs, you pop it into your mouth whole, and whomp down on a refreshing and intensely flavorful explosion. You crunch, you slurp, you savor, and then you wipe off your chin and grab another.Curries are great too. My favorite is chana palak, chickpeas and spinach. But really everything you get is good. I can't remember the real name, but the ""veggie balls"" are also good, served in a creamy spicy orange sauce not unlike tikka masala.I usually warn, besmirch, doomsay, beg people to order from the menu rather than succumb to the ease of an Indian buffet, but Woodlands is the exception. Excellent buffet with a fine selection of curries, rice dishes, soups, bread, chutneys, salads and desserts. It changes daily, and if you're lucky they'll serve kheer (milky rice pudding with cardamom ) and gulab jamun (soft, ethereal donut-like pastry balls made with evaporated milk and served in a way-too-sweet-in-a-good-way-man-i-can't-stop-eating-this syrup)If you know what's good for you, you'll try this place.",Woodlands Indian Vegetarian Cuisine,6154633005.0,127.0,2009-03-16,"San Diego, CA",/biz/woodlands-indian-vegetarian-cuisine-nashville,5.0,232,"Washington, DC",Michael W.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,32.7174209,-117.16277140000001,2274.701151659041,False,2041.0,4.327586206896552,4.5,4.326086956521739

"105 BroadwayNashville, TN 37201",2.5,"Bad customer service will always ruin a restaurant experience. My sister and I stopped in to The Underground for a morning snack during the CMA Fest going on in downtown Nashville. We wanted a mimosa or two and a bite to eat before the next concerts started, so at first we ordered waters, the unlimited mimosas for $20 per person, and an egg sandwich to split. We were given bottled waters - which we didn't realize we would get charged for, because who pays for water at a restaurant? We thought the bottles were just a friendly touch for festival attendees to be able to carry out with them, but our check let us know they were an unspoken up-charge. About halfway in to our first mimosa, we decided we actually just wanted the one drink each and asked our waitress to change our order in the system from bottomless to just one. She checked with her manager and told us that it wasn't possible to change the order. Having worked at restaurants, I know it is definitely possible to make a change like that to an order. The egg sandwich tasted good and was the only saving grace from the experience - until I went to the restroom and along the way saw the chef in the kitchen flipping fried eggs with his bare hands. When we were about to leave, it started pouring outside, and the manager was standing on the covered patio barking at pedestrians who wanted shelter from the 10-minute storm that they couldn't come in if they weren't paying customers. Amid that, my sister and I stood there waiting out the rain and I took out our water bottles that had been in my purse. The manager saw me and immediately started yelling at me that outside beverages were strictly not allowed in the restaurant because we might be carrying vodka or gin in the bottles.

"105 BroadwayNashville, TN 37201",2.5,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. This week marked my second time eating there, and will absolutely be the last.Food:Had the chicken and waffles on my first visit. Chicken was really good, waffles were obviously frozen, bought in bulk from Sysco. This visit I decided to try their burger (which they claim was voted best in Nashville by a local publication. Unfortunately, there is no evidence online that supports that claim. So, liars?)The burger patty itself was good. Quality meat, cooked to order, and decently seasoned. However, there was way way too much arugula, so everything just tasted peppery. Oh, and like onions. Probably because they put 3 rings of raw, red onion cut at least 3/4"" thick. Now, I love onions, in any form, on or in pretty much everything. This was overkill and would have rendered the burger inedible if I hadn't removed it.The fries were awful. Limp, soggy, hand cut wayyyyy too thick. The seasoning blend on them were delicious, but I was only able to force myself to eat 2 or 3. I guess that's okay, because I only got seven (7!!!!!) fries in my side order, which I substituted for chips.Which brings me to one of the biggest issues I have with the food: the price. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, with fries. The burger, which is normally $12, became over $18 by the time my bill came. $2 for bacon (that was not good bacon, too thin), $1 for one slice of American Cheese, and $2 extra for the horrendous fries described above.Bar/Booze:The bartender on duty both trips had NO idea what she was doing. Although she was sweet, we caught her consulting her phone and recipes behind the bar to make drinks that, quite frankly, any beginning barkeep should know. I stuck with beer this last time, and while I appreciate their variety of quality beers, $6 for a bottle of local Hefeweizen or $7 for a local Stout? Seriously?Prices:Even for the tourist trap that is Broadway, as touched on above, their prices are ridiculously out of line for the quality, decor, and service. $25+ for a burger, fries, and a (low-gravity) draft beer is robbery.Decor/Interior:Standard dive bar. Decent patio area. Non-smoking inside. Nice sized stage, but no one was playing either time we were there. TVs throughout, most on either sports or soap operas. Restrooms were small but clean. No soap in the men's room. And no paper towels, only a hand drier. Also, the lock doesn't work, apparently.Management/Service:First visit it was slow inside. Us (party of 3) and 2, maybe 3, other tables. Manager(?)/cook and bartender both sitting at the end of the bar, both eating and watching TV. The manager guy was smoking an e-cig and never once washed his hands before going in to the kitchen to (I assume) cook.This second visit I was with 3 other people, all women. The bar was much busier, but we still got our drinks and food withing a decent amount of time. Ended up chatting with the owner and the door guy for a bit. He's the less famous brother of a C-list musician, and boy, is he something else. Alternating between rude and creepy/sexist. I won't delve into details, but suffice to say, this guy should stick to anything other than owning bars.Overall:Food: 3/5Decor/Interior: 2/5Service: 3/5Prices: 0/5Bar/Booze: 2/5AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.Update: After talking with one of my female friends about this place and the review I posted, she told me that Joey, the owner, kept telling her about the expansion they're doing and asked her if she wanted to see the ""upstairs"".

I will say on the menu it tells you it may take awhile to get your food so I am glad it gave a warning. We had a group of 10 and we were there 2 hours before getting our food but we were prepared to wait. Fast forward to the end of the meal. The girl that buses tables came to pick up some plates while we wait to pay the check. I had my arm on the chair beside me and apparently she said ""excuse me"" a couple of times for me to move it and I didn't hear her. She proceeds to grab my arm and throw it off of the chair. I have never been treated like that in my life in a place of service... When our waiter comes to give the check he tells us our bill is $250 and he can't split checks. Granted we did have 10 people and I understand that BUT they should have told us up front instead of herding us in there and giving us a table. The manager was not willing to work with us and demanding we pay all at once. The food was less than impressive.

"105 BroadwayNashville, TN 37201",2.5,"As other reviewers mentioned, the man that I am guessing is the manager  really does spend his time running around harassing customers and yelling at staff. At first we did not realize he worked there as he was wearing an oversized baseball hat, oversized graffiti T-shirt and chains (he looked like he stepped straight out of a rap music video) and when he was not picking fights with customers or staff he was lurking in a corner smoking behind the bar We were waiting in line for acme and saw this place didn't have a line or a cover so we decided to give it a try. We were a group of 4       professionals and their spouses and we spent quite a lot of money ordering drinks before we sat down in a corner of the bar to quietly mind our own business and listen to the music. The place is nothing special but our drinks were only watered down the normal about for broadway and the band was decent. Not 15 minutes into our visit this manager physically grabbed me by the arm as I was walking to the restroom and proceeded to yell at me, refusing to let go of my arm. Since he was dressed like a gangster rather than an employee and I couldn't hear what he was shouting I just broke free and ran away from him ... but he followed me back to my group and started physically assaulting other members of my group and yelling at them. It turns out that one of us had a small water bottle with them and he was trying to take it away because, as other reviewers mentioned, this place charges for water, even if you just spent a ton of money buying top shelf liquor. When he was done berating and assaulting us he grabbed the water bottle from the table and wandered outside with it.

"105 BroadwayNashville, TN 37201",2.5,"Where to go after the Yelp Helps event? Well, my firend's wife suggested this palce, describing it as an NYC import with  burgers that were simply incredible. I've been to New York, I've had burgers I'll decide if it's got true burger and New York city credentials. After having spent a good time and a decent amount of money there I have to say that burger wise it's a great place for a burger but I have no idea how 'New York' they are. The menu here is simple and uncomplicated, burger, cheeseburger, chicken sandwich. I didn't know about the lack of items and the burger comes with grilled potatoes not fries-which I thought might also be weird and a flop. I was wrong on both counts.The cheeseburger comes with grilled onions and mushrooms no extra charges for anything like that, just added in without a word of it on the menu. Awesome. The burger itself was juicy, flavorful and just making me think about it now makes me want another one. The grilled potatoes were also a winner and were oh so good. I still want to know how a grilled starch can be so moist and tasty and the only complaint I had was that there weren't enough of them, literally like 6 fries (I'm still using the term fries because saying 'grills' just sounds silly.)They also have a menu of Monster mixed drinks, with a variety of different flavored Monster cocktails. I settled on the KAOS Monster (a pineapple/orange variety) with vodka. I also tried the KAOS and rum cocktail-which is an interesting mix on the vodka/pineapple, rum/pineapple.

So there are usually 3-6 people. This past week we decided to try this place out as many of us had not been there. 6 of us in this group and we went a tick early (11:30).Service: Slow, I think the girl working was the only one working the front of the house.The menu is only in chalk on the wall, great if you are facing the wall when you sit down. Seriously get more menus or make it easier to see. It is $2, that is right TWO DOLLARS for water. They won't bring you tap water you have to buy a bottle. Mixed drinks at lunch are $8, EIGHT FREAKING DOLLARS for a drink at lunch on a Tuesday. Tea, coke products and the like are $2 and you get refills. I ordered a cheese burger, medium rare no bun. I got a fairly decently cooked burger with what looked like an American cheese slice on it. I don't mind paying $11 for a burger but seriously this one wasn't worth it. ALL sandwiches come with a small handful of kettle chips (potato chips out of bag). There wasn't a cheese selection, or bread choice etc. There was a stack that contained lettuce, tomato slice, onion and 2 pickles. One person order a side of grilled potatoes and there were maybe 4 slices but she didn't receive her chips with the sandwich. The potatoes are signed as an appetizer so it wasn't fair to not deliver both. Others at the table felt the food was MEH. A lot of folks don't like to spend a bunch of money on lunch, which is why they don't like to eat on that block. But let's compare. National Underground burger $11 + water $2 = $13 plus tip. On the same block burger (bourbon glaze, onion straws and Gorgonzola with fries) $10.95 + water $0  = $10.95 plus tip. Hmm better values can be had elsewhere. I am sad that more places don't give a hoot about folks that are stuck downtown because they work there. This place is catering/charging for the tourist crowd because they can.

I'd heard great things about this spot, so when a friends parents were in town, and Dad wanted a burger we figured it'd be a great time to try it! I was actually really excited to try this place, which I think might be part of why the whole thing was so shockingly disappointing. The food wasn't horrible, but was also nothing special. The photos that are posted on this Yelp page, DO NOT represent what I was served. However - it wasn't the food that made the experience so bad, it was the service. First - we were forgotten. There was literally no one else in the restaurant - not one other customer, and yet we still got forgotten, and continually had to get up and go to the bar to ask for drinks, etc. Second - every order was wrong. Which was kind of awesome, because the waitress had insisted that she didn't need to write anything down. Good one. Wrong toppings with the wrong burger, wrong sides, etc. Not one order was  correct. Lastly - and I am not even sure how to categorize this... I asked for lemon for iced tea, and the waitress brought lemon wedges over in her bare hands, and dumped them into mine. I was so shocked that I awkwardly took them, and then set them on a cocktail napkin. I mean... among other things, I think that is probably some kind of a health code violation, right?

It boasts its little reputation of being owned by a famous musician, being a hotspot for local artists, etc., which certainly makes it appealing. But, I will never eat here again.

Also included LESS than a handful of kettle chips. For 11 bucks? Are you kidding me? Service was completely sub par.

"105 BroadwayNashville, TN 37201",2.5,"I have to give National Underground a mixed review. As a music venue, they give smaller up-and-coming acts (mostly acoustic or country-leaning) a chance to play live in a part of town that is normally reserved for tourist-snaring country covers or overdone karaoke. The room is small - I'd be surprised if 40 people could fit comfortably - but the sound of the room is respectable. There is never a cover, and most live acts are paid based on the cash bar take. The idea is that bands are paid based on how well they draw and hold paying customers. Luckily, most of the groups I've come to see have not overwhelmed the audience with encouragement to drink more, which is more than I can say for the honkytonks up the road.The food is another story. It's not terrible, but it is overpriced and over-hyped. My biggest pet peeve is the constant message perpetuated by the owners that National Underground has ""the best burger in Nashville."" It's one thing to make this kind of pompous claim. Delivering on that promise is quite another. The basic cheeseburger is $11, a price which they do not put anywhere on the table card that passes as a menu. It is a big burger, but it's average at best and a little too salty. I also found it very overpriced. If you want a good burger, there are better places in Nashville at the same or less price (Rotier's, Burger Up, the Pharmacy and Belcourt Taps & Tapas, to name a few). The beer prices were high, but they were no worse than any other spot on lower Broadway tourist strip.My bartender was friendly, and she gets a lot of brownie points for customer service. Our bill arrived without any of my girlfriend's order listed (1 burger and 2 beers). I pointed out that it was half of what it should have been, and our bartender thanked me for my honesty. However, she could not find any mention of the second meal and beers in their register, so she comped it. I split the difference with her on the tip, and I'm giving them the third star for the customer-first attitude.The Nashville branch of National Underground is a fairly new music venue, so I am hopeful they will get better once they've worked through the bugs in their system.

"105 BroadwayNashville, TN 37201",2.5,"True story: the reason I could never be a vegetarian is because I love cheeseburgers too much. Seriously. back in my halcyon teenage youth, I once gave up eating all meat for about 10 months only to be lured back to the darkside by a cheeseburger. So, just know that I take hamburgers very seriously.After reading all these rave reviews about how the burgers at The National Underground were the best in town, I managed to convince my husband to brave the horror that is Broadway after an event at the Frist to try them out. So, obviously a strike against this place right from the get go, because while I'll happily head to East Nashville or Nolensville Road for good grub, I HATE going to Nashville's honkytonk strip. Parking is a pain in the tush, and the parade of humanity that trawls that end of town makes me stabby. But again, I will brave such hardships if the food is good.When we make it to National Underground, we're pretty much the only patrons there so we decide to sit at the bar. There are a few tables littered about, but it's clear that even though food is served here, this place is definitely a bar and a music venue. Much to our chagrin, we got there just in time to catch a solo act who serenaded us with a variety of Billy Joel tunes during our dinner which was really awkward. Nashville is a tough music city so I feel really bad for performers who sign their hearts out to what is essentially an empty room. This guy wasn't bad, but there was a lot of falsetto going on and it was definitely distracting. If you want to catch a show while you eat, this is ideal, but if you have any interest in speaking to your dining companion, this is a big negative. Still, the promise of a cheeseburger kept me strong, despite an intense case of second-degree embarrassment. With all this build up, I suppose it's no surprise the cheeseburgers we got were disappointing and didn't really seem worth the effort. They were certainly massive, as everyone else has pointed out (I only ate half of mine and took the rest to go), and they were juicy too. But were they so juicy because they were also cooked extremely rare, not the medium-rare we had ordered? Perhaps. And were they also over-seasoned (read: salty)? Yes. The buns they were served on were also a travesty as they pretty much disintegrated as soon as we picked up our burgers... I get that burgers aren't dainty food, but these were so messy I almost wanted to ask for a knife and fork. None of these things were deal-breakers, mind, nor were our burgers bad, but for ""best"" burgers, they could have been better. Probably the thing I remember most about our meal was actually the grilled potato slices that came with our burgers. My husband is a diehard french fry fiend, so I expected him to dismiss the potatoes quickly, but he wound up really enjoying them. Some of my slices were perhaps more charred than I would have preferred, but they were a nice addition.Can I also just say that National Underground employs one of my BIGGEST PET PEEVES? Their food menu has NO PRICES on it!!! I HATE when restaurants have drink menus without prices on them, so it should go without saying that I don't like going to a bar where you have to ask the price of your meal because it's not printed on the menu. It always makes me feel like a cheapskate to have to ask how much something is, but I would be lying if I said I didn't take into account how much things cost when it comes placing my order. I think our burgers wound up cost $10 each, which is fair, but I would have liked to have known this when ordering.All in all, I actually really liked the atmosphere of this place (the twinkle lights around Christmas were a nice touch) either as a bar or as a venue to catch a show. But I don't think I'd go back if eating were my sole goal, because while the food was good, there were a lot of obstacles involved to get it and there are plenty of other places in Nashville that make a better burger without the hassle. If you're going because you want to drink or hear live music, then by all means, the burger is better than most, but it's not the one that will get vegetarians to renounce their convictions.",National Underground,6154544431.0,136.0,2012-01-24,"Toronto, Canada",/biz/national-underground-nashville,3.0,109,"Washington, DC",Steph H.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,43.6529206,-79.3849008,350.3224729993701,False,4174.0,2.4128440366972477,4.333333333333333,2.358490566037736

"217 Louise AveNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"It is down right sad when you go back a year later after visiting an establishment to give said establishment a 1 star review, however, I'm constantly reminded of quite possibly one of the worst, most disappointing steak house experiences I have ever had at Jimmy Kelly's.The reason I am constantly reminded is I now find myself comparing the price for a pour of Oban scotch anywhere I go to what may possibly be the most I've ever paid for just a sip of Oban at this Wal-Mart steak serving, poor excuse for a chop house.  The price on our bill for what was practically two sips of scotch (one sip each), $60.00.  The reason I know it was only two sips is because we saw the bartender pour the little that was remaining from the shelf bottle into our glasses without opening a new bottle.We honestly thought we were double charged, but nope, instead we got nothing but attitude when we inquired about the bill.  To top it off, the service was pathetic and the steaks were over cooked and almost tasted boiled instead of broiled.I believe people run to places like Yelp to take the time to write a review because they are either elated or deflated about an experience.  Coming back a year later to write a review is proof how deflated I was after leaving this place.  Given some other reviews, I am shocked this place can stay in business, yet, the place was packed the night we went to dinner.  Hopefully management takes the time to read these reviews to better their business!",Jimmy Kelly’s Steakhouse,6153294349.0,19.0,2013-11-07,"Brentwood, NH",/biz/jimmy-kellys-steakhouse-nashville-2,1.0,95,"Washington, DC",Jason S.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,42.9786981,-71.07283690000001,420.27661688332466,False,1484.0,3.168421052631579,2.0,3.1808510638297873

"217 Louise AveNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Ahh, Restaurant Week, the double-edged sword. I talk myself out of going to ""expensive"" restaurants all the time for fear of having a disappointing experience. Sometimes those fears are unfounded, all too often they are not. The evening started out with so much promise. From the valet out front to the honest to god Maitre D' just inside, the place just screams ""old-school"" class. Frank Sinatra would have felt at home seated in a high-backed leather chair at a white linen covered table in one of their cozy oak-paneled private rooms. The service was top notch. Our waiter, Pee Wee, who'd been at working at the establishment ""off and on"" since 1978, was absolutely perfect. He read my wife and I completely, provided helpful suggestions, and came by only and always when needed. We weren't looked down upon or ignored because we were ordering off the ""special"" menu. When it comes to the food I have just two words for you: Meat. Glue. I am not a butcher, a chemist, or an adhesives expert, but I've worked in enough steakhouses and have seen my fair share of meat glue steaks. Go ahead and open a new browser tab and Google that if you have to/dare. It's a dirty little secret of the meat industry akin to the pink slime found in ground beef. Maybe Jimmy Kelly's chef doesn't know that he's being sold frankenfilet, or he does and doesn't care; I'm not sure which bothers me more. I halfway considered asking for steak sauce.It didn't end there. Our baked potatoes were served still in tinfoil, and the toppings (for which we were charged an additional fee...seriously?) came in paper ramekins, a la McDonald's ketchup. The salads were bagged iceberg and the house Gorgonzola dressing was reminiscent of Kraft, or maybe, if I'm being generous, Wishbone. The corn cakes all the other reviewers rave about? Burnt. A truly disappointing meal. The only thing we enjoyed beyond the atmosphere, the service, and the drinks were the mushrooms and the two cobblers: blackberry and apple walnut. You're safe ordering those I'm sure --the rest? Well, you're on your own. In short, if you go, get something bone-in (harder to fake with meat glue), skip the potato, and soak up the classy atmosphere, the good service, and plenty of tasty tasty liquor.

"217 Louise AveNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"I was so looking forward to trying this landmark Nashville restaurant. I've been to many fine steakhouses around the country and had heard this was one of the best. What we experienced last night was quite the opposite, unfortunately. We were a large group (12) so had made reservations weeks in advance. They paraded all of us upstairs and through and around many quiet diners to a room in the back. A perfect spot for a group, however the tables had not been set up. So, they paraded us back through the dining room and left us as a group on the upstairs landing where we were clearly in the way of the wait staff. We were finally seated, but place settings were incomplete (2 people didn't have forks until after the appetizer course was done) and we soon found the one waiter we had (we'd been told we'd have 2) was not really capable of managing such a large table. At one of the premier steak houses in town, we expected service to be excellent, and this was sadly lacking. Empty drink glasses were removed but no refills offered. Meals came to the table incomplete. A la carte sides, which patrons are encouraged to share among the table, are disappointingly small. Our waiter made a point of telling us how large the asparagus were, and great for sharing. When it arrived there were 4 asparagus (and not the jumbo ones) on the plate. When the time came for dessert, he took orders from some of the table but not everyone, then did the same with coffee. In terms of the quality of the food- the value was sadly lacking for the price. I've had much better steak at Logan's or Outback, and that's just so disappointing. I ordered the special bone-on filet which the waiter raved about. It had so little flavor that I nearly cried when I got the $60 bill. I'm happy to pay a premium for fine food, but this time I literally just threw my money away. My fiancee's manhattan, which was good but no better than a manhattan anywhere else, was $21. Again, I don't mind paying for quality, but nothing about our meal or the service justified those prices. The only redeeming aspect of the meal was my fiancee's cowboy steak (ribeye) that was prepared with the creole seasoning- it really was pretty incredible. Unfortunately, this one shining light was not nearly enough to make up for the rest of the experience.

Still really good though!Dinners come with a salad and your choice of side, so I went with the Cowboy steak (a huge rib eye) cooked medium rare.

"217 Louise AveNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"I've been to Jimmy Kelly's a bunch in the past, so I feel sad rating it two stars. It used to be a great Nashville institution. On my first visit in a long time, I left disappointed.First, the good things. Atmosphere a the defining characteristic of the restaurant, which is in an old house with old paintings and charm all around. The corn cakes served just before your salad are a delightful southern classic. The homemade thousand island dressing is great, although some of my lettuce was drowning. My jumbo shrimp were awesome - I've had lobster tails smaller than these shrimp, and believe me, the shrimp tasted better. The blackberry cobbler desert was awesome.Now the bad and unfortunate things. This is a steakhouse. You come here for steak. I remember distinctly some of the best steaks I've ever had coming from this restaurant, and I really looked forward to that. My filet, ordered medium, came well done and extra dry. Instead of filet mignon I got filet jerky. After everyone at the table was done with their slightly overdone steaks, an obviously overcooked steak finally came out much later than promised. It seems like the steaks were sitting under a heat lamp or on a heated rack waiting for pick-up. The waiter was kind enough to take my suggestion of only charging me for the shrimp and baked potato. But I was still hungry even after taking my table mates' leftovers. Then came the onion rings that were supposed to a side dish, not desert. They were good, don't get me wrong, just very late. They comped these as well, which was a nice gesture.On top of the twice destroyed filets, I found myself sucking on ice cubes because my tiny glass of water was slow to be refilled. I think the root problem was a decision by management to take care of a large party - that arrived after my party of six - at the expense of service to other diners. My sever worked hard and was polite, but was clearly given too much to handle as he assisted other servers working the large party.

Visit with your guests and when one goes so far as to indicate that the evening is not going well, delve a little deeper and find out what's going on. Walk through the kitchen throughout the night and let them know that you care and you're watching. Have someone come in and give those restrooms a thorough cleaning. Watch as appetizers are being sent back and entrees are leaving tables with more than half of the food still on them. Mike, that's YOUR name out there on the sign. Defend it. You were here in Nashville before any of those other steakhouses. It's your birthright. Bring back the Jimmy Kelly's that Nashvillians know, and love and respect.* To our server, whom I did not get your name but I think you have to stand out as one of, if not the only, female servers at Jimmy Kelly's.

When I asked if you had sweet tea, you answered ""yes.  Well, it's unsweet and I can bring you some sugar."" Baby, this is the south. Tea is sweet and it's equal parts -- 1 cup of sugar to 1 tea bag. Plain and simple. When my husband complained that his steak wasn't right, did you know right then that you had keyed in the order wrong or did you discover that later? We all make mistakes but man up and accept it when you do. My husband gave you a tip last night. Partly because he's a nice guy. I also suspect he did this merely so we could go and salvage the last few minutes that we had a babysitter. Here's my tip for you:  find one of your fellow co-workers in a white dinner jacket and follow him around for a week or two. Learn the ropes from these veterans. * To Fred, another server at the restaurant who was assigned to an adjacent table.  We watched you throughout the evening, smiling and happy and providing top notch service to your table while we floundered in the corner with our gal. We watched you be attentive without hovering. We watched you glide in a beautiful minuet as you showered that other table with drinks, playful banter, corn cakes and impeccable service. And at the end, when everything blew up, it was you who stepped in and showed concern. Not our server. Not the house manager. And not that guy whose name is on the sign. No, it was you, Fred, who apologized for our experience and who implored us to give the restaurant another chance. You said you've been there for 45 years. My, the stories you must have. It was a pleasure meeting you last night.* To the cow(s) that offered my husband's and my steaks last night, I'm sorry. I'm sorry they did that to you. A little salt and pepper goes a long way but they denied you.* And, finally, to Jason and Valerie, the hapless diners in last night's saga. We were given MULTIPLE red flags and dismissed, scoffed and laughed our way past each one. We chose to be impressed by the restaurant's website and ability to make a reservation online rather than heeding other reviews here on Yelp. We walked through a near empty dining room on a Friday night at 7 and didn't think a thing about it. We didn't take the cue from our server that this evening was doomed when she was giving pretty clear signals from the moment we sat down and placed our drink order. And, still, when the 1st appetizer was sent back, instead of asking for the check and cutting our losses, we persevered. We pushed on stubbornly. Hopefully, we'll be smarter next time.",Jimmy Kelly’s Steakhouse,6153294349.0,59.0,2012-06-09,"Brentwood, TN",/biz/jimmy-kellys-steakhouse-nashville-2,1.0,95,"Washington, DC",Valerie M.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.03256870000001,-86.7825235,570.5870208308653,False,4713.0,3.168421052631579,2.0,3.1808510638297873

When we arrived, the valets and maitre d helped my boyfriend, brother and I get my mom, who is very sick right now and uses a walker, inside. They graciously helped us get her inside and seated right away, even though we arrived a little early. The table they had reserved for us was upstairs but when they realized my mom was unable to do stairs, they quickly rearranged seating to have our table be close to the door. We were very lucky to have ""King Arthur"" as our server. You could tell he's been there for a while and really loves his job. He was pleasant, very attentive and very entertaining. He made my mother smile and laugh more than she had in a long time. We never felt rushed even though we went on a busy Sat night. We could not have asked for a better waiter!!! Definitely request him if you are thinking of trying Jimmy Kelly's. The food was incredible. We had a group of 5 people, my mom, dad, boyfriend, brother and I. The meal starts off with homemade corn cakes which were right out of the oven and tasted amazing with butter. King Arthur brought us fresh ones a few times throughout the meal so they were always warm. Everyone ordered the fillet, which came with a salad and a side. All of our salads were great, especially with their house blue cheese dressing. Our fillets were all cooked perfectly. The boys all has baked potatoes with toppings which they claim were fantastic. I'm assuming they were good, given none of them would let me try a bite, lol. I got the fries, which were slightly seasoned and delicious. Of course after such a wonderful meal, we knew we had to try dessert. We got the apple walnut cobbler and the blackberry cobbler- both of which were incredible! They melted in your mouth!

Such was the plight of me and Jamie W. as we were readying for our first-time show there. We spent the day downtown and couldn't quite figure out whether we could eat there and brave the traffic. Alas, we decided to play it safe and quickly minimized our dining options to the food court at Opry Mills, the chaotic shopping mall across the way from the theater. I have to say this was one of the largest food courts I've ever seen in a mall as it came complete with a carousel (photo: bit.ly/1KFi4Z6).We were hoping to find a hot chicken stand but no such luck, so we were swayed by the loud-mouthed girl who was acting like a carnival barker getting people to come to her kiosk of Middle Eastern fast food. The minute we got up to order, we were treated like prisoners at a cafeteria as they kept motioning us to keep moving along even though there was nobody behind us. All the toppings were in front of us Chipotle-style (photo: bit.ly/1JfO18q), and the staff was ready to make mountains on plates. I ordered their premium item, the $8.29 Pyramid Club Plate.It was a combination of gyros and chicken with grilled onions, green peppers, mushrooms and melted cheese with a cup of tzatziki sauce (photo: bit.ly/1QiAZr0). I have to admit it wasn't terrible. It was actually quite a bit of food even for Nashville, although I frankly don't understand this Deep South habit of adding a pile of shredded cheddar cheese as a topping.

I didn't try it so I can't comment about the taste. I can however comment about my dinner, the Mariscada Ranchera. Amazing and delicious are the 2 only words that I can use to describe it. Filled with seafood that included: snow crab, squid, shrimp, scallops, octopus (didn't eat the octopus, I have my limitations) among other things in a spicy red sauce. It was delicious and very filling. Imagine Joes Crab Shack.....but Mexican style !! Make sure you ask for some extra napkins because you will need them for the snow crab legs !! It is not overpriced at all.  My meal was $15.99 and my fiancee's was $8.99. For the 2 of us for dinner with a some queso and chips and 2 drinks, it was roughly $40. Not bad at all. Our server Jake was awesome and made sure our drinks were filled at al times and was really attentive to our needs. Make sure you give this place a chance. I see some negative comments on here but try to look past those and give Guac a shot.

You never know if they are going to be there in a few weeks. But this place was far better than I expected. I sort of loath the tons of cheese with no discernable tastes other than peppers that accompanies many Mexican restaurants in Nashville. Guac was noticeably different. The enchiladas looked like chicken with cheese and the fajitas had real steak like meat. I got fajitas which were definitely light on the steak and heavy on the lettuce and beans, but what was there was really good. The tortillas tasted great and they gave us plenty of chips and salsa. We went in for queso and guac both of which were good enough that I ate them but also made the kiddies happy. They definitely could up their salsa game given the number of legit Mexicans that were working in the kitchen - it tasted pretty store bought.Our waiter was super sweet, the portions were generous and everything was clean and relaxing. This place stands out a bit in Bellevue because its quieter than other Mexican places and pretty darn tasty (vs tasteless). For $50 for 3 people and mom's margarita, it was a super solid deal.

Or if they actually filled it with maybe cheese or veggies.  They could break up tortilla chips and cheese into the dish, and it would be better than this egg based one.  I wouldn't recommend this at all, just a waste of money.  You are better off making eggs at home and eating with bread.   The veggie burrito was a step up from the relleno, but so is biting your nails.  The burrito also lacked flavor, just didn't taste like much at all.  The burrito is definitely big, so there's plenty of it, but just seemed very plain to me.  I covered it with hot sauce at home, but that besides the point, because besides the heat from the sauce, this was a forgettable meal.  Obviously, it's from limited choices that I picked from, and I don't know how their meat options are, but I wouldn't really recommend this place to anyone.  I think I've had better food at fast food Mexican places than here.   On the bright side, there is a frozen yogurt place two doors down, so you can drown out the bland taste afterwards with some frozen yogurt.",Guac Mexican Restaurant,6158180485.0,50.0,2015-02-07,"Nashville, TN",/biz/guac-mexican-restaurant-nashville-2,2.0,63,"Washington, DC",Alvin P.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.1622296,-86.774353,566.7091028370305,False,2543.0,3.4285714285714284,4.0,3.4193548387096775

"7114 Hwy 70 SNashville, TN 37221",3.5,"In a word: Ewwww.First, the good. The service was fine. Our server was pleasant and patiently took the time to answer a couple of questions about the menu. Service was better than average for an inexpensive restaurant in a strip mall.  Also, the chips and salsa at the beginning were pretty decent.  Most importantly, it did not make us sick or anything, which along with outright rudeness would probably be my threshold for a one-star review.  So two stars, but the bar is pretty outstandingly low.Now the bad:1. The cardinal sin -- the food did not taste good.  We had two main dishes -- fish tacos and a ""vegetarian"" (more on the quotation marks below) chile relleno.  The fish (tilapia) in the tacos was too salty and WAY too greasy for allegedly grilled fish.  The tacos were served with the fish, shredded lettuce, diced tomato, and cilantro -- but not with the other usual accompaniments for a fish taco like white sauce or cabbage or lime. The chile relleno was filled with what seemed to be melted American cheese.  Really.  It tasted like the plastic-wrapped slices melted.  The breading was very heavy, and it was soggy on top because it was topped with a yucky mystery sauce (see below).  The accompanying rice was way too salty, and the smear of guacamole on the plate was roughly the quality of what I expect on Irish pub nachos, not what I expect at a place called Guac.2. The menu was inaccurate in troubling ways.  Most troubling, the extensive ""vegetarian"" section of the menu -- maybe 15 items -- wasn't.  Almost all the ""vegetarian"" items were accompanied by beans, which (to our server's credit) our server informed us were made with pork, even for the ""vegetarian"" dishes. She told us this when we double-checked about the non-meat status of the fish taco accompaniments.  Lying about the vegetarian status of your food on your menu is a pretty shitty thing to do to customers, many of whom feel strongly about this.  You can label a menu section as ""vegetable dishes"" and have them contain meat, fine, but if you label it ""vegetarian"" it damn well better be vegetarian.  Vegetarian means no meat, not just no big chunks of meat.Less troubling but still not great, the food descriptions on the menu were wrong.  For instance, the chile relleno was described as being topped with egg and a tomato sauce.  Our server informed us that the ""egg"" referred to the breading, not an actual egg.  We expected that the ""tomato"" sauce would be something like ranchero sauce, but it turned out to be some sort of mystery sauce instead.3. The mystery sauce was just gross.I honestly don't know what this stuff was.  I'm pretty sure it was not primarily tomato.  Maybe some sort of odd mole?  Anyway, it was a bright orange sauce that tasted like canned tomato soup mixed with vinegar, mayonnaise, and sugar.  It could have been an authentic chile relleno accompaniment from somewhere (I doubt it), but even if it was, it was just gross.

"7114 Hwy 70 SNashville, TN 37221",3.5,"We have been here twice: once to eat in and once (tonight) for takeout.  Both sucked.  The food we got when we ate in was mediocre at best.  No flavor, very boring.  The salsa served with warmed chips was okay and FREE.  Not great, not interesting, not unique---it was okay, but FREE.  I ordered a chicken chimichango that was just terrible.  I can't even describe why--it just wasn't good.  At all.  I can't remember now what my husband ordered that day but he was not impressed, which is putting it mildly.  He hated it.Tonight we called for takeout.  I asked if chips and salsa came with the orders like it would if we were eating in.  No.  It would have cost $4 to get chips and a small, SMALL. container of salsa.  We opted for No.  I ordered shrimp tacos, my favorite thing in the world.  Yuck.  No flavor, the tortillas completely fell apart and were just gross.  Shrimp was fair and lettuce was iceburg.  That's it for the taco.  There was some pico de gallo that tasted hot---only hot--nothing else--and I ended up eating with a fork and leaving most of everything else except the shrimp.  My husband had some fajitas left over from a non-Mexican restaurant from two nights ago that he wanted to eat, so he ordered a tostada de Camaron.  Double yuck.  Ice cold, tortilla shredded and fell apart and there was no flavor whatsoever.  His two-day-old fajitas from a non-Mexican restaurant were fabulous compared to all of what we ordered from Guac.

"7114 Hwy 70 SNashville, TN 37221",3.5,"So today...I went with my family to lunch at Guac, after a nice afternoon on the Natchez Trace. Initially, they had given me and my wife positive reviews, so we were interested to see what all the hoopla was all about. Well...upon further review, let's just say one would be wise NOT to buy into the positive hype surrounding the place. On the bright side, they have good guac. On the not so bright side...goodness...where do I begin? I'll start out by saying it was a light traffic day...maybe 4-5 other tables were occupied during our stay. The owner of the restaurant was casually sitting at a corner table, disengaged and disinterested in what was going in the restaurant. After we ordered our food, it took over 30 minutes before we received anything (besides chips). With such light traffic, I can't find any excuse as to the long wait. The lengthy delay became evident when we noticed our beans & rice, once delivered, were completely cold. Not lukewarm, but chilled and bland...as if they had been sitting out on the counter for a good, long while. On top of that, three of the four orders were incorrect in some capacity. For instance, my mother-in-law ordered corn tortillas with her meal, but was given flour tortillas instead. When she asked for corn tortillas a second time, it took another 20 minutes before they were brought out. Needless to say, she wasn't very happy...and felt completely devalued as a customer. For me, personally, I knew something was off when I ordered a diet coke with lime...and it came out a diet coke with lemon (granted, this by itself is a small deal). But the cold beans and rice was a first for me...and I've eaten out hundreds of times at mexican restaurants in the Nashville area the past 6-7 years. On top of this, there was no offer of a partial refund on any part of our order to account for the multiple mishaps. So, that was additional salt on the wound. Overall, the taste was medicore...definitely not anything special to justify the poor service. The prices are fair, but still...I have no clue why the ratings are so high with this place. Now, I assume we simply caught them on a bad day; however, it doesn't change the fact our experience was highly disappointing...and judging by what I'm hearing, the quality of service and management has dropped fast in 2015. So hopefully this establishment can get its act together quickly.

"120 19th Ave NNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Royal Thai had a deal on Scout Mob for 50% off so we decided to try it, big mistake.The inside of Royal Thai is pretty cute. They have nice floor-to-ceiling murals and lots of kitsch and character. If you were to judge a place on decor, you would expect this place to be the bee's knees. But this is just another lesson in ""don't judge a book by its cover."" (Or more precisely, don't judge a Thai Restaurant by its murals.)When we arrived there were 3 other people in the restaurant. By the time we got our menus everyone was gone and we were the only people there. At 7:30 on a Friday night we were the only people in this place. Not a good sign. The worst part was that the place was completely silent. Eerily silent. No background music, no chatter, nothing. Every word I said bounced off the walls and I'm sure our waiter could hear everything (and maybe even the kitchen staff). I was so put-off by the silence that we decided to take matters into our own hands. We opened up Spotify on my phone and started DJing our table. I would normally NEVER EVER do this, but there was no one else there so I was 100% sure that we were not pissing anyone off. We were hungry so we ordered the pork spring rolls. They came to the table fairly quickly which was a plus. The roasted pork inside the spring roll had good flavor, and the dipping sauce was good. Unfortunately the spring roll was mostly lettuce and cabbage and the normal delicious ratio was off. They were also really cold which made me think that they were pre-made and just chilling in the refrigerator.At this point I guess our waiter was totally bored so he decided to take a break. He got his own Thai ice tea and sat down at the table across from us. He took out his cell phone and I guess he was checking facebook/texting/anything that wasn't his actual job. Good to know that the ONE STAFF MEMBER feels totally comfortable to just kick-back on the job. At least go to the kitchen area or something. We  ordered the duck curry which was supposed to be roasted duck in red curry. What arrived was not duck curry at all, but a totally different dish, roasted duck.  The waiter realized what was wrong and said something like, ""yah, that isn't what you ordered...umm...I can take it back."" But we were hungry and decided to just eat what they gave him. I would totally pass this off as a normal mistake, but honestly, how?! We were the only people there so they weren't busy. This is just total incompetence.  The duck itself tasted like it was made ages ago and defrosted. The brown sauce it was covered in was pretty salty, probably to cover up the freezer burn.I ordered the Pad Woon Sen with beef. The description said it was ""Bean Thread Noodles stir fried with our house Soy Base Sauce"" but didn't say it came with any vegetables. All of the other noodle dishes on the menu listed the vegetables that were in the dish, so I asked the waiter if it came with veggies because I didn't want noodles only. The waiter was unsure if this dish had vegetables (WTF?) and went to ask the kitchen. He came back and listed off a bunch of good stuff so I went ahead and ordered it.What I received was not Pad Woon Sen, but a pile of mushy brown stuff that was inedible. It was so salty I could feel the salt crystals burning into my lips, cheeks and tongue. This dish was hurting me!So I sat their pouting, feeling really bad. I was upset because I couldn't eat dinner and that our nice date-night out wasn't going as planned. The waiter looked in our direction and noticed that I wasn't eating and asked what was wrong. I told him that the dish was just way too salty and inedible. While he said they could re-make it, I was so pissed off at this point that we just asked for a bunch of to-go boxes. We packed up our food without eating it. While we did get the Scout Mob discount, we got no money off the check and no apology for the quality of the food or our experience. I guess it's a common thing at Royal Thai that patrons immediately leave after their food hits the table.We had dinner #2 at Woodlands.

Little did I know that I was about to be in for the worst Thai experience of my life. Being a vegan, I have gotten used to discussing veganizing Thai dishes. I have gotten pad thai at many restaurants with no egg or fish sauce. I ordered that here and they brought out a gross pile of fried rice noodles with no sauce on them, a couple gross looking pieces of tofu on top and a small bowl of peanut pieces on the side. It was a gross sticky pile of white rice noodles. There were no veggies, no bean sprouts, no green onions. None of the things that make Pad Thai delicious. Do they ever put veggies in their Pad Thai? If they don't, that is awful. They expected us to eat it.I asked to send it back. When I asked the server, who was basically incompetent at life, he looked confused. I asked for another dish, Pad Ke Mao, that could be made vegan. When that came out, there was no tofu and it was the most oily noodle dish I have had.

"120 19th Ave NNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Straight up, I'm giving this place an extra star just because of how wonderful the service was. My husband and I came here for lunch and we were really pressed for time. After being seated, it took our waiter about 5 minutes to come over with our waters and take our orders at which point we asked whether we'd be able to be in and out within 30 minutes. Our waiter rightfully pointed out that a bunch of tables had come in around the same time so it might be tight but he would do his best to get our food to us quickly and thought it would be do-able. Our waiter totally came through for us because in under 5 minutes of ordering, he had our spring rolls out to us and another 5 minutes later, our mains were sitting in front of us. He never once seemed flustered, nor did he seem annoyed or aggravated with us mentioning we were in a hurry. He also took care of the bill really quickly when it came time for us to pay, which we really appreciated as well. He managed to be efficient but friendly, which is not always easy to pull off and we both really appreciated it. Bravo!As for the food itself, it's not the best Thai food I've ever had (and seems somewhat ""Americanized"" to me), but the $8 lunch specials are good value, I think (and apparently if you're really pinching pennies and calories, most of the specials are just $6 if you forego the spring rolls... but why would you do that?!?). My husband ordered the Kao Moo Daeng, which is roasted pork in a sweet BBQ style sauce. It was pretty decent (the pork had a good 5-spice ""char siu"" flavor), but the one thing I found disappointing is that the dish was literally just pork, sauce and rice. No veggies or anything, which I always hate, because that doesn't seem like a balanced meal to me. I got the red curry with tofu, and I think that was a lot more successful. The broth wasn't as rich as some other places, but it was decent and above all, I appreciated that when I ordered it medium spicy there actually was some spice! Not enough heat to fry my tastebuds, but enough to add an enjoyable zing.Overall, this is a middle of the road Thai place in terms of the food, but the service really made a positive impression on me.

I love cigars, so it's nice to go smoke a stick and watch the game. Food is good bar food. No corner pub or sportmens. Staff is generally friendly. Hate/don't like so much:Went in on Saturday at 1015 and the kitchen was already closed. They then turned off the TV we were watching that had a hockey game tied 2-2 in the 3rd period with no warning. Didn't even ask if we were still watching. They kicked 6 of us out of the roof patio after march madness on sunday because they were closing it. At 6 PM!!!! They made us pick up our stuff, go downstairs and watch it out front. I would have left but the Preds game was just about to start. So maybe I am a stickler, but when you have 6 guys drinking and eating heartily, you don't kick them out or relocate them. I'm sorry, that is bad business.

However, since I joined a group of guys today who are out to find the best wings in Nashville, I decided that I should play along. Boy, am I ever glad that I did! These wings were awesomely tasty! On the menu, the BBQ is actually Honey BBQ, which is what we ordered. They're messy, but oh-so-worth-it for the flavor. The wings were cooked to perfection, not dry or underdone. The vibe of the place is that the people working there really do care about their customers. As first-time orderers, I felt like they were patient and answered questions without irritation. The food is made to order, so there is a slight wait but not unreasonable. I gathered from the way the orders were coming out that they make a huge batch of wings at a time then put the orders together, because they would 'knock out' several orders at one time. Highly recommended to check out, especially if you're like me and your experience with wings has been national chains. Give these local guys a try!

We also ordered other flavors: Lemon Pepper (too oily, but the meat was dry), Country (just plain ol' fried chicken), and Cajun (regular fried chicken with some spices). Overall, I found their wings to be consistently dry and smothered in even more dry breading. I do like that each order came with 2 single servings of ranch dressing. I go through that stuff like a hooker goes through blow. I found it to be the only thing to combat the dry meat.So here we are. Why did I give them the A-Ok rating if the wings sucked so bad? Answer: Their freaking biscuits! They should just start calling that place ""Knock Out Biscuits"". Fucking phenomenal. The biscuits are light and fluffy. They aren't flakey like dinner biscuits.The consistency is more like that of a shapeless cupcake. They have a neutral mild flavor on the inside, but on the outside, they have a thin glaze of sweetness. I think it may come from honey.

Well my 11 year old son would eat chicken every day if we let him, so we decided on wings. We normally do the BW3 thing or Pizza Hut or some other place like that, but I decided we needed to try some local, less advertised, mom and pop type place. GREAT CALL! First off, while the place may not be all light up, don't let the look  of the building fool you. Its what comes out of that kitchen that counts. It took about 20 minutes for our order to be done, (and there were a few folks who came in after us and got their food first, but I am assuming they either called their order in or were regulars who order the same thing every time), but the wait was worth it. The wings, unlike most buffalo wings you eat, actually had meat on them. I like to eat hot foods, so my son got the mild wings and I got the hot wings. Hot?? Someone ought to check the recipe because I swear acid is one of the ingredients. They were really hot but I couldn't stop myself. Unlike most places that have hot sauce just for the sake of being hot, these were hot but with flavor. Amazing wings. This brings us to the sides. I got cole slaw, which was great, and the cajun fries were the best I have ever had. Even my wife liked the Slaw and she hates everything. That brings me to the Baked Beans...As I have said, my wife is the most finicky eater in the world. I let her try a small spoon of the baked beans, thinking she would turn her nose up and say a half hearted ""they are alright"". Wrong. After I gave her that spoonful and asked her what she thought, her eyes lit up like a kid that opens a present on Christmas Day and gets that Pony they always wanted. She then not only cleaned the bowl, but God as my witness, STARTED LICKING THE BOWL! By the time she got done, that bowl looked like it had just come out of the sleeve. I, in the 10 years we have been together, have never seen her react to a food like she did to those beans, EVER.While the biscuits were good, compared to the rest of the meal they were not on par with the chicken and the sides, but thats like saying that you have two players on your team, Michael Jordan, and ""only"" Kobe Bryant.

We had not only me and my parents, but my brother, his wife, and the 8 month old twins for their first high-chair experience.First off, I think this is in an old fast food place so it is tiny. The parking lot made me feel like a great white shark as I circled and circled just waiting for people to move. And when we went in we had to wait quite a while for a table to open up that was big enough to seat us all. But we weren't really in a hurry so no big deal.By the time we were seated, I felt like I could eat everything on the menu because I was so hungry. The problem with being that hungry is that you are going to be indecisive. They have the lunch menu going on but ALSO the BREAKFAST menu all day. i mean, what am I going to do? Breakfast sounds killer but so does lunch! Oh the stress.So I got an appetizer because I had never heard of it before...Htipiti. it was a spiced feta spread and it was FUCKING DELICIOUS. I haven't had anything like it before and we were all pretty enamored with it.So I chose the bacon lamb burger despite the fact that they said it had been featured on Food Network. The burger was ok but was small, a little dry, and there was no bacon. However, it had taken so long to get our food that I wasn't about to give it back. Plus there were ample fries to munch on. My dad got the full Greek sampler which looked good. My brother had some Cowboy burger that looked like a total artery clogging dream. All the food I tried from their place was good - standard diner far with a Greek twist. Overall I was pleased with this place.So why, if my lamb burger was not probably up to their usual standards, did I give them 4 stars? Well, the lamb burger wasn't BAD, it just probably wasn't their best. I am sure if I had said something they would have remedied it immediately, but I didn't because I wanted to just eat.  However, they seated us at like 1:30pm when the sign on the door said they were closing at 2pm for a holiday staff party, and they still seated our large party. The waitress had a lot of tables and busted her ass. And she was friendly and fawned over the twins and chatted with us when she could have rushed us out the door so they could clean up for the party. And we were there quite a bit past 2pm after all was said and done and never felt rushed. There was just something about the home owned, diner feel that made me feel at home.

"7071 Old Harding PikeNashville, TN 37221",3.5,"This was my first visit to Athens in Bellevue. Upon arriving I was seated fairly quickly. I was struck by how noisy and how bright the place was. The atmosphere felt more akin to a fast food restaurant, and I would not recommend it if you wanted an intimate or relaxing dining experience. After I was seated, my server disappeared and I was left waiting almost 15 minutes at my table (even though the restaurant was not busy). The server who eventually visited my table was very friendly, which partially made up for the wait. I ordered the vegetarian Greek platter and an olives/hummus appetizer. The olives and hummus appetizer was tasty - the pita was warm and plump, the hummus was not special but good nonetheless, and for the price I thought it was a good deal.The vegetarian platter, however, left a lot to be desired. The moussaka was meh, ok, kind of tasted like some frozen gourmet meal. There was a small dish of vegetables in tomato sauce that I actually thought was quite tasty. The rice was a huge no - it tasted like the kind that comes pre-cooked in a bag. There was a cheesy potato side dish that was tasty - but then again, it was almost pure cheese, so hard to mess up. The portion was big - I had enough to take to work for lunch the next day.As a Bellevue resident, I'm glad to see this place here. The more variety of restaurants the better I say.

I was even more thrilled the day I was able to step into Athen's Family Restaurant, freshly opened off of Hwy 70 and Old Harding Pike.  I had always wanted to go.  I had been taunted by The Food Network when it featured their local fare from their Franklin Road location on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  I had attempted to go a few times to that location, but every occasion didn't quite work out.  I was ecstatic to see the potential it had in my neighborhood.  I have not been disappointed....I have dined there at least 10 times with this exception, they have an expansive and rather delectable looking breakfast menu that is available all day but I have yet to try breakfast so with that, their review is way overdue!Their staff is friendly, courteous and very efficient.  They have taken the time to try menu items and give recommendations if you are torn between a few dishes, which I always am since they seem to offer an array of authentic fare that I was not used to getting at other traditional Greek restaurants.  In addition,  I always bring our toddler along and I  feel that special attention is given to her needs which makes us feel even more welcome.  I have tried so many of the menu items, but the one most recently that stands out is the Vegetarian Mousaka.  I am not a vegetarian by any means, but every now and then I like to give it a try.  It was excellent.  The layers of tender vegetables, carrots, broccoli, eggplant and zucchini really just melted in my mouth.  Topping it off was this subtly decadent bechamel sauce.  The dish was paired with a greek salad and tangy dressing.  Needless to say, I didn't think I was going to leave feeling too guilty, until my husband insisted on dessert.  (I'll get back to that.)I have been thrilled with all of their Greek sandwiches on their menu.  Their lamb gyros are just really tasty, better than I have had, but the Lamb Souvlaki really is the best.  The lamb is tender and perfectly marinated and has become my husband's favorite.  I can always count on having a taste while I branch out for something new with each trip!Now, for dessert....ahhhh!  They really know how to spread the love with phyllo!  They have the best Baklava I have ever tasted.  It's not the usual pistachio nuts layered with phyllo dripping in syrup.....nope, it is a heavenly but flaky warm pillow of phyllo goodness encasing walnuts and cinnamon, not too sweet and  with just the right amount of a light lemony syrup.  It absolutely melts in your mouth and it's made fresh daily and enough to share, but really, who would want to do that!  They also have my now second favorite, but could move to number one or at least tie the baklava.  It's called Bouyatsa.  It too is a decadently flaky warm pillow of goodness, but with a homemade custard inside and sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon on the outside.   If I had to describe it, it's like chess pie married phyllo and they had offspring.  Really, really good....!With such a wonderful addition to Bellevue, you must come out and try!  Get to know their staff, the chef.  They make you feel like you are part of their family.",Athens Family Restaurant,6159533204.0,13.0,2012-01-23,"Nashville, TN",/biz/athens-family-restaurant-nashville-2,4.0,70,"Washington, DC",Michelle P.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.1622296,-86.774353,566.7091028370305,False,3228.0,3.5285714285714285,3.0,3.536231884057971

"7071 Old Harding PikeNashville, TN 37221",3.5,"My intent last night was to simply get gyro plates from Sam's Kebobs, but my wife told me I should try ""the other place"" across the street. I am glad I did. A greek place in Nashville that actually serves something other than the standard gyro, rice, salad, falafel and hummus.The location on Old Harding Pike used to a be Mrs. Winners Chicken place, so it does not have the most ample seating. Fortunately, the staff is very good at clearing tables and getting people sat. While I waited for my to go order, I saw a few people come in and sit down to wait and the longest was about 2 minutes. Having the manager out on the floor is a definite plus when you want to be able to sit down and eat.My thrill, even though I did not order it, was seeing Pastichio on the menu. As I mentioned above, it is hard to find more than the standard gyro place fare in Nashville. The reason I did not order  the pastichio was the fact they also had Lamb Souvlaki.First, the negative. The gyro is presliced and grilled on a flat grill. The gyro has a nicer flavor than most of the flat grilled gyro I have eaten in the past, but I wish they had gyro off the spit, as it tastes so much nicer that way.On the positive side. The lamb souvlaki is nicely spiced and succulent. Lamb can taste pretty bad when it is not prepared correctly, so souvlaki is a good food to judge the quality of the restaurant. This is nice and tender and has a wonderful flavor.The greek dinners comes with either french fries, rice pilaf or Dina's creamy potatoes. Of the three, I would definitely pick the last. The creram sauce is similar to avgolemono soup with cream added. Something I ate had a hint of cinamon, which really made the flavors pop. I am not sure if it was the souvlaki or the tzadtiziki, but the two together were quite beautiful. I talked to the manager about saganaki (Greek flaming cheese), which they unfortunately do not have. He mentioend the Avgolemono soup and threw in some for me to try.

"7071 Old Harding PikeNashville, TN 37221",3.5,"OK, I'm sorry--I promise, I really did want to like this one.  I have been here at least a dozen times, each time convincing myself that I just ordered the wrong thing on the menu.  I don't like leaving negative reviews.  But I really think I'm done, and if I can forewarn you then I have done a good deed!On the first visit, my husband and I ate dinner and I ordered the Mousaka.  It sounded delicious, anyway.  In reality, it was bland and very cold in the center.  (Microwaved?)   It was long enough ago that I don't remember details about any of the sides that came with it, except that I didn't like those either.  Total miss.  That was the only time we visited for dinner, because husband didn't like his (at least his was hot though).  If we are in the mood for cuisine in this vein, Sam's across the street has great gyros and the Anatolia Turkish Restaurant on White Bridge is still our go-to place by far.  We just couldn't justify going back here for dinner.  The rest of the times we have been here were all for breakfast.  In short, if you order eggs (basic, scrambled), you're fine.  Order from the specialty menu and you're treading dangerous ground.  Everything else that requires more cooking ability is going to be horribly bad.  I've tried eggs benedict, and it is quite honestly the worst I have ever had.  The English muffin base was not good (stale?), and I'm still trying to figure out what they did wrong with the hollandaise sauce.  It tasted like mayonnaise treated with food coloring, and it had a bizarre thick semi-solid consistency.  I asked my husband to try to draw a parallel because all I could think of was semi-dried paint, and he nailed it: if you've ever had orthodontic accessories made, it is exactly like the plaster they use to make a cast of your bite structure.  Awful!After that experience, I ordered plain scrambled eggs and those aren't too bad, but I could make those at home (and I can barely cook toast).The omelettes are just eh...not fluffy, slightly greasy (even if you're ordering the vegetarian version)...again, I have managed similar at home.One day, more out of frustration to find something that was good and not scrambled eggs, I ordered the stuffed french toast.  It is described as ""Texas french toast stuffed with cream cheese and fresh strawberries.""  In reality, it is a sandwich cut diagonally (on regular bread) with cream cheese and strawberry jam.  Seriously!I would recommend sticking with basics, but even then you're not guaranteed an edible meal.  At one time the oatmeal was good but they have apparently changed to instant and it is made per order by the servers.  Our last oatmeal came out crunchy, and it was so bad my husband actually sent it back and told them to forget it; it had taken so long to come out that we were both already finished with the rest of our breakfast.  We got the full explanation of how our server wasn't sure how much water to add. Oh well...Service is hit or miss.  Everyone is friendly but you could end up waiting a long time, even if there are few people in the restaurant.  On the last few visits, I have given up waiting for the bill and just stood by the register waiting for someone to check me out.Atmosphere was pretty fairly described by someone else on here: it's a former Mrs. Winners.  I can forgive cheap atmosphere if the food is good, but this place just doesn't cut it.    How was this place featured on the Food Network?  I just don't get it!",Athens Family Restaurant,6159533204.0,20.0,2012-05-28,"Nashville, TN",/biz/athens-family-restaurant-nashville-2,1.0,70,"Washington, DC",Anne D.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.1622296,-86.774353,566.7091028370305,False,3497.0,3.5285714285714285,3.0,3.536231884057971
"7071 Old Harding PikeNashville, TN 37221",3.5,"I've experienced both incarnations of Athens both the original on Franklin Pike and this one in Bellevue. I can't say I've been impressed with either, which is surprising since they rated a visit from a Food Network show. After many visits I suspect that Athens is just one of the ""lucky ones"" that got a little buzz (probably mainly b/c of their late night hours and breakfast over in Melrose) and they now are just coasting on the hype.I've had the gyro meat as part of a sandwich and alongside eggs for breakfast. Both times I found it dry and like some sort of pre-processed strips of meat. I've had the Spanakopita which I'd give mixed reviews, since it seems to either be hit or miss. I've sampled a few other items off friend's plates from their pretty extensive menu, and I can't say that any of them have been impressive. Things often seem to have a dried out, re-warmed sort of texture and taste. The service at Athens is hit or miss, but most of the servers there don't make you feel rushed to finish and free the table, which is a good thing. Sometimes that lack of rush borders on being ignored though. While the waitstaff in general are friendly enough, the (owner?) management is not so cordial. Pricing is a bit high on some things for the portions and quality, but Athens is an ok place to try the more complex ""homestyle"" Mediterranean dishes if you don't want to leave Bellevue. Just don't expect them to be as good as you may have eaten at other restaurants. If you're just looking for gyros and Greek basics, I'd say visit Sam's across the street for better taste and a much better portion-for-the-price ratio.

"7071 Old Harding PikeNashville, TN 37221",3.5,"I wish I could write a review and give this place Zero stars, but oh well.As you'll be able to tell from my review of the alternate location of this establishment (the one on Franklin Pike) I really do like the Athens Family restaurant, or wanted to like them. I had a great experience with both food and service at the Franklin pike location so today a co-worker and I went to the Old Harding location for lunch.When we arrived, we were looking for a parking spot and drove around the building. We happened upon the executive chef (I know this because he was wearing his chef's jacket with the title stitched into the cloth) opening/messing around with the man hole cover in the driveway, which looked to be the sewer cover and was also smoking a cigarette.  Smoking I can handle, wash the hands, all good. However I wondered what an executive chef would need from under a manhole cover.Having faith that he would adequately clean his hands, or at least, let someone else cook we decided to enter.  The place was not very busy, only 4-5 tables were full and we were told by a waiter to go ahead and sit and he'd be with us in a minute. No Problem.Except, that was the last and only time we were spoken to or even acknowledged for the entire 10-15 minutes we spent sitting at the table.  The table behind us was checked on and supplied with needed items. Two tables to the right of us were also checked and re-supplied. All while the waiters walked completely around and past our table. we didn't even have menus, so there was no wondering about if we were ready to order.  To beat it all, a guy who came in after us and sat in a far off corner was brought a drink, a menu and was having his order taken as we left, by the SAME server who asked us to sit down.When we got up to leave another server was standing RIGHT beside our table. He didn't ask what was wrong, try to stop us, nothing. It was as if the staff here could care less about you or your business. (Unless I suppose you're one of the lucky few who got there before us.)All in all, I will most likely never go back there and not to the one on Franklin Pike either. If it was a large chain like O'charleys or Logan's and I received bad service I'd try out another location. But since the same folks who own and operate the Franklin Pike location own this one, I see no reason to support a total lack of quality control and management.I posted a small rant on this on Facebook as well, since Yelp was doing maintenance and I was ready to give this review. A friend who saw it said that they know these people and basically they do not care about reviews or opinions anyway. So, I'm glad I did not take the time to complain while in the place.

"1310 Antioch PikeNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"Here is a little known fact about why I chose to settle in Nashville: They had an Ethiopian restaurant. When I was making my way across the country visiting grad schools I would take myself out on a ""date night"" to see if I could live in whatever city I happened to be in. My night in Nashville consisted of dinner at an Ethiopian place close to campus (which is no longer in business) and visiting the Frist museum. Culture and ethnic food in the south? I was so ready for Nashville. Since I moved here more Ethiopian restaurants have opened (or they're just new to me). My favorite will always be Addis Red Sea in Boston, but Mesob in Nashville comes fairly close! Located a little out of the way from my usual dining circle in a tiny strip mall, Mesob is a no-fuss type of place. The decor consists of what appears to be old banquet dining tables and chairs mixed in with cheery paintings and artifacts from Ethiopia. I was hoping that a restaurant named Mesob (after the traditional Ethiopian table) would actually have them for seating. But they didn't, and that was tad bit disappointing.We had the beef Sambusa, the vegetarian tasting plate and the Qey Wot. I was so happy with our choices. Everything tasted so good! My favorite was probably the Yemisir Kike We't (red lentils in a spicy berbere sauce).Overall, I really liked Mesob. The service was great and we got our food rather quickly. I was really impressed by this because a HUGE group (maybe 30 people, 75% of which were kids under 10) arrived at the same time we did. Our waiters didn't overlook us to take care of the big table, a problem I have often. The owner was sweet and even stopped by to say hello and introduce himself.

It was about 20 minutes tops. We ordered a Kitchen Sink, and also the free medium cheese pizza. Our total was about $20 - what a steal right?The service was friendly, and prompt. We felt good about being close to home and giving our business to a local place with quality we were sure would top the chain places. Castrillo's did not disappoint.

"1404 McGavock PikeNashville, TN 37216",3.5,"Located in Riverside Village, Castrillo's offers a different variety on pizza than other local options (non-chain). We ordered two pizzas that were fresh and hot when delivered. One was the Kitchen Sink and the other the Jordan's. They were perfect except for leaving off the basil pesto that we had ordered to be added to the Jordan. Mistakes in a restaurant are easy to fix, but those related to delivery aren't. Having regularly ordered from another pizza place in East Nashville regularly, this will make me second guess my choices. Back to the za; good stuff! The pizzas here are always cooked to near perfection. I feel the baking time should be increased to another minute or so because the crust isn't quite stiff enough to hold up under the weight of the toppings. For this, we toss them in the oven at home for another few minutes to tighten them up. Also, the crust is more on the softer side. You can eat the crust without a back of beverage and also is sweet and savory. They do make a good pie. The ingredients are top shelf and the sauce has a every so slight sweetness that makes eating that one extra piece more than you should, a must. The delivery times here are short. Usually 5-9.

(i learned this when i had zachary's chicago-style pizza in berkeley -- i couldn't appreciate it until i decided not to think of it as pizza at all, then i realized how amazing it is).ok, castrillo's. let's start with the crust. oh, the crust. it has never failed me, never been burnt, and never been underdone. it's fluffy and a little bit sweet, and light in your mouth, and unlike my favorite pizza in san francisco, where i never ever ate the crust, i can savor this to the last bite. the crust is awesome. and the toppings have been great in every version i've tried my usual is pesto pizza, with onions and feta cheese. it's truly perfect. when i'm in a meat mood, sausage and pepperoni, both of which are high quality meats (bad pizza sausage, which is used in lots of chains, is not edible -- but good pizza sausage can make your day). the hawaiian was great too, and i tried one that had bacon and banana peppers on it, which was interesting. and yes, they're all cheesy, so if you don't like a lot of cheese on your pizza, tell them to go easy with it. but really, i can't imagine the argument against cheesiness. and the bread sticks are fantastic, they must be made from that magical crust dough -- and the feta cheese sticks?? oh. my. god. they are so good it's amazing that you can get something like that for five bucks, though with pizza, it's a bit of bread overkill, so you might want to get a side salad to go with them and make a meal of just that. (the side salad was totally edible, if ordinary, but eating salad makes me feel just that much less guilty about eating too much pizza).oh, and they also take their magical bread and make cinnamon bread sticks, which they deliver with a little tub of that sugary topping that makes cinnamon rolls so good. for under five bucks for something like eight of them, you can save them for breakfast. heat 'em up, put on the icing and yum.and if you need dessert, they even have new york cheesecake from the cheesecake factory if you want, and reese's peanut butter cheesecake, but i'd suggest the homemade brownies. yes, delivery can take up to an hour, but ji just plan ahead. it's worth the wait.",Castrillo’s Pizza of Inglewood,6152262900.0,67.0,2010-04-05,"Nashville, TN",/biz/castrillos-pizza-of-inglewood-nashville,4.0,55,"Washington, DC",leslie a.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.1622296,-86.774353,566.7091028370305,False,2921.0,3.5272727272727273,3.0,3.537037037037037

That being said, DO NOT GO TO THE ONE IN NASHVILLE and expect the same experience. I live in Nashville and really like seafood, so about a year or so ago, my wife and I went to Joes. The food was as always, very good, but the service was less than stellar. After a year, we decided to go back and try again. The first problem is that in the Nashville downtown area, there is little to no parking, so you have to pay 8$ an hour. Not a big deal, I figured an hour should be fine since the place did not look at all crowded. So we parked and went on in. We were ignored by the host as he continued to finish his conversation with another employee, but I figured that was probably something important, so I waited patiently. A couple minutes later, he seated us. We sat there for 15 minutes and no one even came to get our drink order. Now understand, from my table, I could see 9 employees, 5 of which were standing in a corner visiting with each other, and there were only 11 tables with people seated. So now here we are, 20 minutes into out hour parking and we have not even been able to get a glass of tea.

"123 2nd Ave SNashville, TN 37201",3.0,"I arrived in Nashville burnt out on BBQ, burgers, and anything deep fried - a state I never thought possible (thank you, Memphis!) I wanted a tasty meal that had not been in sight of a fryer and which would not write off my evening or break the bank.Joe's Crab Shack fit the bill. It's not downright cheap, but compared to London prices for seafood it seemed very reasonable. We started with crab nachos to share. While not out and out dreadful, this was a pretty bland dish and the crabmeat got lost in the mix rather than adding another level of texture and flavour. My tip - skip the starters!For a main, we shared two steampots - the Arctic Bay and the Ragin' Cajun. Both were absolutely delicious and full of meaty claws, lobster, prawns, clams, sausage, sweetcorn....all steamed to perfection with wonderful herbs and spices that really made their presence known.This is not fine dining - you will wear a bib, you will make a mess and a bottle of beer is probably your best bet to accompany rather than a dainty glass of crisp white. The service can be hit and miss and the venue is huge and sometimes a little rowdy.This is not cheap chain dining - while this is a chain, the prices certainly aren't rock bottom. I dare say there are places when you could get, for example, steamed crabs or oysters cheaper if you had the time to investigate further.But the quality of the seafood we feasted on was to be admired and it certainly made a welcome break from the heavier, richer fare we indulged in on our trip round the southern states.

No forks no plates..we then spent the next 9 minutes trying flag down anyone in order to get at least a fork. Literally we had people look right at us and turn around and walk away, others walked right past our table completely ignoring us. Eventually I was able to get a waitress to stop, but was accompanied by an eye roll. The hostess finally came over slammed a bucket with some utensils on the table with out a single word. At this point my beer has still not arrived. We then got our bibs, but before I can say anything she runs off..still no beer. Eventually my beer finds its way to my table with the lame excuse ""they had to change the keg."" Dinner has arrived, and don't get me wrong the crab is pretty Damn good. Our waitress finally begins to be very attentive on us..by dropping our check off while we are very clearly still eating and continues to come over to check on the bill.. still eating mind you. So I proceed to tell her that we are planning on ordering dessert later, and will need a menu. So she shows us the menu and leaves, not even 3 minutes later...STILL EATING OUR DINNER..she asks what we want to order. I honestly never felt so rushed in my life.

"123 2nd Ave SNashville, TN 37201",3.0,"My family called a few hours ahead to ask if we could reserve a table or two. The staff told us that they did not accept reservations and that we would just have to wait and see if they were full. So, we arrived to a mostly empty restaurant, and guests just standing around. When speaking with the other guests, it was learned that they had reserved tables. In fact, several parties had magically reserved tables! My family tried to get the attention of several wait staff, but many just walked by and pretended they did not see us. After having small talk with several families and looking into a half empty space for about 15-20 minutes, I finally asked to speak with a manager or hostess. The other families got seated, and we were told that it'd just be a few minutes until some tables were cleaned.After 10 minutes we thought our tables had been set, only for one of the wait staff to ask the same round of questions that we had been asked by three other staff members, just 15 minutes prior: How many, what's your group name, and can you hold on one moment while we get more information? The staff member told us that we had been wait-listed and then quickly made her exit. After 5 more minutes of looking over the same overpriced menu and having personnel ignore us, we did what they so obviously wanted us to do...We all left.When I think about it, I'm pretty sure that the restaurant wasn't expecting so many people on a Tuesday night. However, the staff made absolutely no effort to speak with the guests to explain their situation nor did they provide my family with any alternatives.

"1601 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"I've worked across the street at Vanderbilt for years and never bothered to visit Sportsman's. I finally went with a group of 4 co-workers yesterday. We mainly went for some drinks but ended up ordering food after a couple of hours.The first thing we noticed as soon as we walked in was this strong odor in the air. It smelt like stale smoke/food/sweat all combined.  You get used to it after a little while or that might have just been the alcohol dulling my sense of smell. Either way it wasn't an issue after about 30 minutes.I started off drinking vodka/cranberry. It was happy hour so my drink was in a tall glass and supposedly with a double shot of vodka.  I'm no alcoholic, I can almost count on both hands how many times I drink in a year. I had 5 drinks within a 4 hour period and had a buzz but nothing like I should've had after the equivalent of 10 drinks. I don't think I was getting double shots. I even confirmed it was happy hour with the bartender.  The rest of my group drank beer and they got their 2 for 1's in 2 separate glasses. After an hour, we moved from the bar to the patio. We were immediately greeted by a server. Nice guy, very happy but very forgetful. We ordered another round of drinks which came in a timely manner but then we didn't see the server for another hour. We had to go back inside to the bar to order more drinks. Not sure what the problem was as there were only 10-12 people in the whole place at the time. Once the server finally returned we ordered some food. Two of us ordered the buffalo wings and two of us ordered cheeseburgers and fries. The wings came out quick, like 10-15 minutes but it was a half hour before we got our burgers and fries. The wings looked and tasted damn near perfect, I'll get those next time. They were crispy fried and tossed in the sauce with extra sauce on the side. Yumm. The burgers were greasy but still good, cooked to a perfect medium-well. The buns were a little soggy but whatever. Unfortunately, all the grease had puddled on the plate right under the fries so they were extremely soggy and nasty.The prices were right on with every other bar & grille in that area. The wings were $9.99 and the beers were in the $2-$3 range. My mixed drinks were around $7 and the burger n fries were on the special of the day for $7.99.  The server was quick to come around and drop the checks off, before we were even half-way done with our food. I had to go back inside, yet again, to get another round of drinks before leaving.All in all, it's just OK. I mean, I would go back again but, only because its right across the street from my work.

After power was restored the waitress came back in and took the other table in the room's order and looked at us - still no acknowledgement. By this time we'd looked at the menu to exhaustion.

Ok. Do they have anything on their menu? As they were discussing his next choice of side, she then informed me there was also no more pineapple for my skewers.

"1601 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"The main problem I have with Sportsman's has been that I visited it with a group of people at 6pm on Wednesdays for years and nearly every time the service was so bad it was laughable (and we have many notes from the evenings about it too).What I learned on the patio over the years before our group left:1) If at a group, anyone pays and has to leave, you can expect service to stop to the table.  Your waiter will look occasionally to see if the rest of you are done.2) If seated and nobody has come to see you in 10 minutes they forgot you.  We ran the clock up to an hour and 15 minutes one time before going in to grab drinks, at an hour and 17 minutes we had a waitress.3) If it's 6pm / happy hour, you must order every drink you're going to want for the next hour at that point as you're most likely not going to get a second drink order in before happy hour ends at 7.4) No matter how you try to contact the manager electronically or by leaving messages, you will never get a call back unless you're wanting to rent the place out - we tried seeing if we could get an extension on the drink specials if we were bringing in an average of more than $200 a gathering, and were never able to get a second round of drinks due to nobody ever coming back out to serve us. Calls and emails went unreturned, so did our business.5) If you have a really good waiter, they will be gone and never back there the next time you're there.6) If you sit on the patio and there're 3 waiters working, you will be told that the reason service is so slow is that the 1 waiter you've got is also handling the largest table inside.  If you happen to go inside there will be one table of 6-8 people and another table or two of 2 people and no particular reason evidenced to why there's no way to get a second round of drinks before happy hour ends.7) If you have an event that will pay off immediately and not over the course of 4 -6 weeks in profits, you will receive a call in under a day.  Learned this when we had contacted them about how much money our group was spending and one of the group also contacted them for a private party for work.That's about that.  The food is average, there're a couple of vegetarian options and they're ok but not good bar food.  on a 2-4-1 they serve you both beers at once, which means they're warm by #2 unless you're a hardcore alcoholic.  I, and the group I'm with, want to love this place (it was home for years in spite of the service) but we've consistently been treated like we're an imposition, and the place is always less than 1/4th capacity when we're there so it's not like we're taking up space, and our bills and tips are high enough.That's my review, mostly seen from the patio as that's the reason we went to Sportsman's.  We have not been back in a while.Edit 10/20/2010 - service was good, still don't know why we went back - get there before it starts to suck again / current good outdoor waiter quits.",Sportsman’s Grille,6153201633.0,573.0,2010-09-27,"Nashville, TN",/biz/sportsmans-grille-nashville-2,2.0,57,"Washington, DC",Paul K.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.1622296,-86.774353,566.7091028370305,False,2950.0,3.10989010989011,2.5,3.1235955056179776

"2800 Opryland DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I ate here two nights in a row and was greatly pleased.  The first night my steak was overcooked; however, I am still giving 4 stars because they remedied the situation extremely fast.  Once I got a new steak, rare just the way I like it, I was pleased.  It was buttery, lean and delicious.  Before that, I had the tomato salad. I expected a little bit more, as it was bland and the heirloom tomatoes weren't that sweet.  We shared three sides: lobster mac and cheese, onions and mushrooms and the broccoli rabe and carrots.  The lobster mac and cheese wasn't as tasty as I expected it to be.  I think they missed some seasoning in that batch.  The other two veggies were outstanding, with the onions and the mushrooms being my favorite. I could have just eaten a side of that.  The second night we started with the Oyster Rockefeller.  Be warned, the oysters are not sitting on a bed or seasoned breadcrumbs, it is SALT! I completely ruined my oyster by sprinkling some on top.  I had the same steak the second night(can you tell I am a filet girl?) and it was equally delicious.  Before dinner, I had a Belevedere martini and our server was so nice to get me blue cheese stuffed olives, even though I was told they didn't have them(I wish I remembered his name as he was fabulous, and sang me Happy Birthday at well.  Dined on May 15th around 7:30).  The dessert was a chocolate ganache with fresh whipped cream and it was the most delicious dessert. I ate the whole thing, as no one from the table wanted a bite. The wine list in good, not too overwhelming which is good. Nice blend of varietals.  I would like if they poured a better sparkling in the glass, however.  My only negative would be it gets so dark in there at night that it is hard to see your plates, hence taking salt for breadcrumbs.  It would be nice to have a little more light.  I would recommend the restaurant again for sure.  If you are attending during a conference, please make reservations.  There were people that were attempting to walk in and no tables were available.  Oh, the library is a perfect to have a cocktail prior to dinner.

I do apologize for my CRS moment as I have just drew a blank on his name. I asked for him each time. He was from Cairo where my main base was during the Army. With this, we clicked and talked about days through the country and North Africa so attention was way above par. 5 star.The menu is rather limited, which is a good thing. IMO a large menu offers different fare selections at mediocre quality. Limited menu means less options but great food. Naturally I had the fish dish others steaks. All side items like the lobster mac was spot on.The check tally grew with the wine. The wine list was very good. Black Tears was the choice. Decanted and pouring on! 5 bottles later we were all in a happy mood. If you have a question here they have a person on staff to suggest make and vintage.

"2800 Opryland DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"We ate there the weekend the hotel reopened, thinking it would be a safe choice. Unfortunately, it does not compare to its cousin, the Old Hickory at the Gaylord Texan outside Dallas. We had to catch the Rockettes show at 8, so we ate at 5. Service started out very friendly, but moved along at a glacial pace. Two courses later, it was almost 7:30 and we were in danger of missing the shuttle bus to the Grand Ole Opry house. A lobster chopped salad had pretty good flavor though the serving size was less than a racquet ball. An onion soup was a reltively credible version, not too salty, yet full of flavor. The steaks, however, were quite a disappointment. My Kansas City strip was medium-rare as ordered, but tough and dry as leather (more like a tough Timberland working-class leather than a soft, buttery Connoly leather). There was no marbling at all (nor was there any fat whatsoever)...what grade of meat was this??? At $44, you would think it would be a dry-aged prime, but I suspect not. The steak was hardly edible even when drowned in the steak sauce (2$ extra for two tablespoons!!). My wife's 8 oz filet suffered from the same malady though fortunately, there was less of it to down.As time ticked on, we finally tracked down our waiter who had originally been friendly. We timidly mentioned that we were in a hurry and wouldn't be having desert.

The ambiance cannot be topped.  The Hotel gives the sense that you are dining al fresco, but of course, it is the illusion of the grand glass ceilings.  You are spaced out amongst the restaurant to offer privacy and other nearby tables' conversations never interfered with ours.Now, onto my Best Kept Nashville Secret:Between the beautiful foyer of the hotel and the bar, The Library, is a charming paneled room decorated like a fine Victorian club.  There is a lovely fire place and large, inviting chairs, though they recently remodeled these and I miss the originals that had more ambiance.  If you sit there, the bar staff (Joey is very nice, in particular) will see to your needs and you can summon the fromager.  There is a cart laden with 20-30 international cheeses of all varieties.  For a quite reasonable price, you can order a tasting plate of your choice with little nibbles of other delectables that bring out the flavor of each.  My husband and I do this little ritual for almost every anniversary and birthday as we live quite near the Hotel.  We do a progressive dinner through the hotel.  We start with sushi in The Cascades, go on to the cheese and port here and then on to another hotel restaurant for our dessert.  The great thing about the hotel is you can take unfinished alcoholic beverages with you as you stroll leisurely through the gardens and water features to your next destination as it is all one indoor establishment.

However, we had come for dinner, so it wasn't obvious where the hostess was. Eventually we found her at another entrance, but not before ordering drinks in the lounge.

"2800 Opryland DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I rarely take to the internet to voice dissatisfaction with a restaurant, but I must. While, for someone who has not experienced many steakhouses, this restaurant may seem impressive, for someone who loves great steakhouses, this was a very disappointing experience. First, the steakhouse insists upon itself. Their menu brags of a sustainable menu and hand-selected producers of beef... okay, but who is doing the selecting? They brag of an extensive cheese menu... that isn't very extensive... and their wine menu is both overpriced and under assorted. Now, before you dismiss this review as that of a snob, let me assure you that I simply make these points to emphasize how much this ""signature"" steakhouse insists upon itself, only to be quite unimpressive. The service was adequate, and the server seemed interested in accommodating our requests; however it took a very long time to get drink refills - when I am paying $24 for a GLASS of wine, excuse me if I would like it to be prompt.  Both my wife and I were impressed with our first course, she had their Ceasar salad and I had the Lobster Bisque soup - which I confess was very good. Our steaks and sides were another story. My wife ordered the filet and I ordered the NY strip - I am being God's honest truthful when I say that we have had better-prepared steaks at a Texas Roadhouse. Just awful. My medium-rare was more like a dried-out medium-well and her filet was so crusted with salt that she actually had to cut off the top of the filet just to eat the rest. Unfortunately, because we had tickets to the Opry, we didn't have time to send either meal back. Their cabernet reduction sauce was a waste of money, even at just $3 extra. It's bland flavor wasn't even sufficient to make my beef-jerky steak tolerable. I cancelled a reservation at Fleming's Steakhouse to eat closer to the Opry on the night of the show - HUGE mistake. We were both so solidly disappointed that as we were walking away from Old Hickory, my wife said that we might as well have eaten at the mall food court next to the Opry and saved our money to prepare a steak dinner at home.   $208 that I will never see again - don't make my mistake. Make a reservation elsewhere and enjoy a better meal... I recommend Fleming's or Morton's in Nashville.  Then again, if you like the way that a Ryan's steakhouse cooks their food, and you simply want to pay 10x more than you would at a Ryan's, Old Hickory is the place for you.",Old Hickory Steakhouse,6158716848.0,4.0,2012-04-23,"Ballwin, MO",/biz/old-hickory-steakhouse-nashville,1.0,68,"Washington, DC",Bill M.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,38.59501820000001,-90.54691329999999,729.4490829236089,False,2462.0,3.6176470588235294,2.3333333333333335,3.6769230769230767

Some folks ordered salad, I'm sooooo glad i didn't go that route. The salad consisted of huge chunks of lettuce was barely no dressing.

For appetizers, we started with an above average escargot; hot and tender but not as rich or garlicky as I'd have liked.  The seafood platter wasn't a chilled one as I normally order, but a hot one.  The lobster tail was tender and flavorful, but a step below the quality of a top, independent steakhouse.  The crab cakes were small but delicious, jam packed with real crab meat. The shrimp cocktail was pedestrian, and the shrimp small; if the shrimp don't require a leash, I'm not interested.  For main courses, the filet mignon was the clear winner; tender, well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  I was talked into the ribeye special, which was a minor mistake.  The flavors didn't meld well (wine reduction and coffee grinds?) and it didn't add anything to the underwhelming meat quality.  Too fatty, and just not my thing.  The Mac and cheese side dish was fantastic, and my calorie count exploded; but it was perfectly prepared and I'll give credit when due.  Broccolini was a small portion and uninspiring.  The wine list was top notch, and the Bordeaux style blend we had was outstanding.  Overall, I have mixed feelings.

On several occasions I have been witness to overhearing a great deal of yelling and cursing coming from the back of the establishment, and have noticed a GREAT deal of turnover. I started to pay closer attention because I know that a lot of turnover in an establishment is usually a bad sign, and I was curious about all the yelling. On some visits I noticed the usually peppy, friendly server girls looking very nervous and not acting their selves. I then took it upon myself to ask a few of the past employees, who I had gotten to know over the time they worked there and I saw out other places, as to why this is such. I was shocked beyond belief to learn that they are very poorly treated by their boss, and even more horrifying, some of the kitchen staff are made to cross-contaminate the kitchen, and even the food, when sanitary items, like gloves, are senselessly not ordered by the owners. I know from working in restaurants many years myself how important it is for good sanitary precautions to be in place. It's a very big ""no no"" to cross-contaminate a kitchen, whether you are a business or just in your home. I have children, I wouldn't chop up meat and then put a plate or bowl that I am about to serve to them on that same spot without thoroughly washing that spot first. But, that is exactly what some of the staff are instructed to do at Vittles! The past employees also complained that they were possibly stolen from because their paychecks never came out right. My fellow man and Nashvillans are being mistreated, stolen from, and potentially poisoned. From the outside, Vittles of Donelson looks like a loving, family oriented business, but I assure you, they are not. This review hurts my heart. I held Vittles very close to it as a continuance of my memories of people I loved very much.

Meat was smoky and decent, but not moist enough and definitely not enough BBQ sauce. Fries were nice, hot and crispy though, and hit the spot. I managed to snag the booth with outlets underneath before it got really packed in here. Service was pleasant and prompt. So, overall A-OK for a airport dining experience, and I think that really says a lot. Funny side note: It seemed like everyone on the plane had a hankering for BBQ, because upon boarding, you were hit in the face by a wall of BBQ essence....
