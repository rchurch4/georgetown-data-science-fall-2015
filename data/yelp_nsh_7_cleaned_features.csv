I started with the caprese salad which was large enough for two and the buffalo mozzarella was fresh and yummy for my entree I had the ravioli stuffed with smoked gouda topped with an alfredo sauce and caramelized onions the ravioli was al dente has it should be and the combinations of flavors were excellent and of course it was very rich.

"2264 Lebanon RdNashville, TN 37214",4.0,"Mother's Day lunch... We were a party of 24 that turned to 14 and the manager was not very happy about that. As we all sat down the server was not happy that another server was assigned to help him with our party. As an ex restaurant manager myself I would've taken that to the back. But as we ordered drinks and appetizers, it did get a little better. We had the bruschetta which was really good and fresh.  It was well seasoned and the fresh basil and tomato we're great. We also had the artichoke dip which was good too but not served super hot.  As you know the premise of this restaurant is fresh pasta and I could see the headache building for the chef as the restaurant was more than half full and I could envision the pots of boiling pasta water filled to the brim.  As our entrées arrived I was able to try a spoonful of the Bolognese which was very good. As I was looking over the menu though I decided for the pappardelle pasta and Granchio sauce.  This is the definition of Granchio directly from their website.  Granchio lump crab meat, white wine, diced tomato, garlic, olive oil and hot pepper.  Homemade pasta is very thirsty and I could tell mine had dried up by how the pasta stuck together and the sauce was not evident, so I asked for some extra olive oil. After I had added the olive oil and tossed my pasta, I went for another bite.  The crabmeat was not lump as honestly for the price I was not expecting that, but I was expecting a little more than what appeared to be backfin. There was no seasoning and I could hardly tell that there was white wine and garlic in the sauce. Overall I think this dish was not put together very well.  The rest of the table seemed to like what they had, so I will probably go back to try another dish.  Over all our experience was good but I must say the hospitality was not there in the beginning and that's the first chance to WOW someone.  On a lighter note the restaurant was very clean and they were willing to take a reservation for a party as large as ours on Mother's Day.",Mirko Pasta,6158827990.0,17.0,2015-06-28,"Lakewood, TN",/biz/mirko-pasta-nashville-4,3.0,66,"Nashville, TN",Jay R.,36.1622296,-86.774353,36.013413899999996,-84.03185620000002,153.81557718393412,False,2048.0

Our server was a gentleman named Jeff and a trainee Michael both were attentive but not overly fussy and super nice. The white bean/olive oil dip was so good, I could drink it with a straw. Had a pasta with a pesto cream sauce- very tasty. Friends had the mushroom cream sauce and loved. co-worker had butternut squash ravioli and raved about it.Entree were generous, service was great. Here is where the 4 star heads to 3 star....dessert. Pistachio gelato tasted weird, didn't have the texture of gelato and had a weird licorice (anise) after taste.

They have a decent selection of wines, with reasonably-priced offerings to compliment any entree.  Complimentary bread was good, too, along with the olive oil-based dip.Shortly thereafter, my entree arrived.  The pasta was tender, stuffed with a rich butternut squash.  The cream and sauce were perfect companions to the pasta - - I thoroughly enjoyed the dish.

I should note that I am a very low maintenance guest and don't enjoy a lot of spectacle or scripted presentations from my server - I'm happy with the fundamentals.  Unfortunately they don't seem to be focusing on things like keeping drink glasses filled or remembering food orders.  My last visit on May 9th, a Friday, for instance. Our server was bubbly and rattled off the 20 or so different pasta varieties, took our order, then disappeared.  When she brought our sparkling wine, which came in individual serving plastic bottles, she brought one that was already opened, flat, and half empty, asked what one of our table had ordered again, and disappeared.  When she showed back up she told us that the bottle must have been opened to mix one of their wine blends and she'd bring another - which they didn't end up having in stock.  About this time another server showed up with an appetizer that we didn't order before finding his way to the right table.  My drink glass stayed empty for 10 minutes during her absence.  Our food arrived and was excellent. Our server showed up to check on us and rather heavy-handedly asserted that our table needed more wine.  I recognize where restaurants make their largest profit margins but I take issue with the whole peer- pressure ""It's Friday night guys, cut loose and live a little"" routine.  The same scene played out with dessert with, ""Really? You want to split a tiny little bowl of ice-cream?""  Why servers insult both their guests judgement and preferences, and their employer's portion sizes in this way baffles me.  The dessert was delicious and plenty large for 2 people.As a side note.  The chairs on the outdoor patio are absolutely atrocious.  The back rest is tilted at such a severe angle that unless you really slouch your back rests solely on the very hard lower crossbar.  You're basically leaning against a metal pipe. Look, the food is excellent and I do recommend Mirko Pasta to anyone.  I describe the service as uneven because so much emphasis and attention is placed on the parts of service where sales and up-sells are conducted, and so little is placed in-between, where the guest dining experience really happens.  I don't begrudge them selling but don't make it so overtly heavy handed and don't take the sale and disappear until the next sale opportunity.  That's the only thing keeping this place from being a very solid 4 star joint.",Mirko Pasta,6158827990.0,2.0,2014-05-10,"Nashville, TN",/biz/mirko-pasta-nashville-4,3.0,66,"Nashville, TN",James S.,36.1622296,-86.774353,36.1622296,-86.774353,0.0,True,2790.0

"972 Main StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I need to come here for lunch more often. Moving from Miami to Nashville, I had to change my expectations when it comes to eating Latin cuisine. I was going to say good-bye to black beans, plantains and adobo and say hello to tortillas, papusas and tacos. It's all good. I eat it all. So, it came to pass that on a hot summer day, I needed a margarita. Luckily, my friend knew just where to bring me. The margarita program at Five Points is strong. Served either on the rocks or deliciously slushified, there are a variety of flavors from which to choose. Don't settle for a regular margarita when you can be like Johnny T and get a blackberry one! Holla! No sooner had my chalice of tequila berry magic come to me than was I presented with a basket of crisp, thin chips and a tub o' salsa. Now we have a party. Y'see as abundant as Miami is with Caribbean fare, when it comes to Mexican eats, it trails behind other cities. It tasted great to be eating real Mexican food again. Not content to much on chips & salsa (although I could have), I took advantage of the lunch specials (there are a lot of them and they're favorably priced) and ordered a chimichanga with guacamole. It came with beans, lettuce, pico de gallo, a metric ton of hot, bubbly melted cheese.I destroyed it... and it took some effort to do so. For a lunch portion, the chimichanga was pretty large. My friend was unable to finish his fajita plate. Even though the food is on 'special', Five Points doesn't scrimp on the portion size. You definitely get your money's worth.

"972 Main StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I was really hoping this 5-points mexican place would be different than the other mexican restaurants within a few miles. I was hoping for a more 5-points vibe, little upscale or trendy, with a more unique or specalized menu. We were disappointed. The menu, seems like a duplicate menu of Las Maracas up the road- except with even more options. The print is tiny, and there is literally hundreds of options. It is all generic, regular mexican food- nothing special or fresher than a typical mexican joint. We order the sampler, all beef to start. I then ordered beef fajatas and my husband order the carne asada. The sampler came out all chicken and all dinner entrees came at the exact time as the appetizer. The waitress took the sampler appetizer plater back while we ate our regular meal. She forgot the tortialls for my husband and jalepenos for myself. This is expected as its a brand new place, so not everything was going to come out perfect as there is a hefty menu to memorize. The fajatas were pretty standard but my husbands carne asada was over cooked, no seasoning (not even salt/pepper) and didn't get that crispy grilled crust- seemed more like it was cooked on a flat top. I will say the 2.99 maragritas were really good- better than other places in town for a house marg. The other highlight that was good was the appetizer platter, once it came back. The flatuas were hot and crunchy and the beef was nice.

It's basically just a shack with a screened-in porch. I've eaten awesome barbecue from even more run-down spots than this, so I wasn't too worried.Their only option for beef was a pulled brisket plate, and I wasn't really in the mood for chicken or turkey. That narrowed things down to pork, which is probably the most appropriate order at a place called Hog Heaven anyway.

Luckily for me, the potato salad was creamy and rather tasty. There was a good blend of spices and plenty of bite from all of the red onion mixed throughout. My beans had an interesting flavor, kind of like a bean soup without all the liquid. The slightly-mangled ribs appeared to have a good crust. All of the meat fell off in my fingers, which is usually a bad sign. I found a decent smoky flavor, but otherwise the ribs were kind of bland. Some parts of the meat were a little tough as well. Although I'm not a big sauce guy in general, I thought the white barbecue sauce might help jazz things up a little. The white sauce was much zestier than regular red barbecue sauce. It also added some heat, which played nicely. I know that white barbecue sauce is generally reserved for poultry, but I really enjoyed pairing it with the pork ribs.My favorite part of this meal was definitely the white barbecue sauce, but it wasn't enough to salvage the mediocre ribs.

However, the much-touted white sauce (no surprise) and the BBQ pickles (surprise) saved the meal and bumped it up to 3 stars.

The mac n cheese was very cheesy and flavorful enough, and the green beans were just what you would expect.Overall, Hog Heaven is decent. It's not bad, but it's also not much above the norm.

The ""mild"" sauce was similarly decent, but not great: definitely strong on the tomato and spices, a little bit peppery and a little bit sweet. As a lover of Kansas City-style barbeque, I'm familiar with tomato sauces, and this was neither as sweet as it could have and should have been nor was it applied as liberally to the pulled pork as it could have been.The sides were a mixed bag. The baked beans were surprisingly good, with a lot of pepper, an interestingly creamy sauce, and excellent texture. The greens and cornbread hoecake were, to be totally honest, disappointing. The greens were flavorless and mushy and the corn cake was also generally underwhelming.I wouldn't advocate this place as the first choice for barbeque in Nashville, but if you're by Centennial Park and absolutely don't want to cross the city to get to Mary's on Jefferson, Hog Heaven will suffice.",Hog Heaven,6153291234.0,4.0,2013-06-28,"Indianapolis, IN",/biz/hog-heaven-nashville-2,3.0,147,"Nashville, TN",Nathan T.,36.1622296,-86.774353,39.7683331,-86.15835009999998,250.97368975880303,False,1491.0

"2300 Elliston PlNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Majority of the reviewers have said it, it's definitely a modern, contemporary take on a sushi restaurant but not so much that the comfort factor is lost. On a Sunday night, my party of 4 came here for dinner and we were greeted/sat immediately. Our waitress was quick to visit us as well! Service throughout the meal was a-okay.This place has weekly specials, and on Sundays they have all day ""happy hour"" where select apps are $5. For alcohol, they have the 2-4-1 drink specials which include $5 drafts, $6 glasses of wine, $9 cocktails, and sake (can't remember the pricing). My party went with sushi for our first venture into this restaurant, and though I was only able to try my BF's ""chirashi"" dish, my ""crazy tuna"" roll, and a salmon maki roll, everything on our table was presented nicely and neatly.I tried the crazy tuna on the recommendation of Johnny T. in order to avoid the mayos/cream cheese, and he didn't steer me wrong, it was a good choice. This 8pc. roll is a simple blend of avocado and tuna, flavors complemented each other and the fish tasted fresh. The salmon maki roll is really tiny in size but at least it tasted good. As for the chirashi, it includes about 4 different fish served over sushi rice and topped with some sliced beets. Something that really made me laugh was the soup! One of our friends ordered the miso soup and it came out in the smallest bowl I have ever seen, in fact the spoon was too big for the bowl. The bowl is akin to a dessert bowl for a scoop of ice cream. It's incredibly teeny. I think a major takeaway point here is to be aware of the portion sizes! As others have mentioned, the prices here are really steep. My crazy tuna was $18, chirashi $25 for reference. Although the sushi tastes good I wouldn't say their prices are worth it. I've had sushi equally as good for less. But my overall experience was good and my party enjoyed ourselves.Would I come here again for a causal dining experience? Nah.

"2300 Elliston PlNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I'm glad to see more recent reviews 'getting' Nama. No, this isn't your mom & pop sushi spot. Yes, the prices are probably higher than you want to pay for a to-go order. But this isn't a to-go kind of spot. This is a destination spot for a fun evening of eating and drinking. Thing is, if you want a more affordable, casual experience, you can get it here. The lunch menu/special is cost effective and Nama offers a happy hour that introduces their food/drink program for reduced price.Look up, look down, look all around... this is why the prices are higher. The folks behind the Nama machine spent time, effort and money to construct a visual appealing place (that patio alone) at which people would want to spend some time. Yes, it's an interesting situation that there are other sushi restaurants within spitting distance but they offer very different experiences.* This is a fun, sexy place to which you could take your gf, boss or buddy and have a fantastic experience. I've spoken on the decor and vibe... let's get to the food.It's awesome. Nama offers a broad Japanese food experience. While the maki is good, allow yourself some time to venture past the sushi offerings. When it comes to rolls, the caterpillar (eel, snow crab, cucumber topped with avocado and eel sauce) and crazy tuna (spicy tuna, cucumber topped with seared albacore, avocado, scallion and ponzu sauce) are my jams. No mayo or cream cheese to be seen. But when I'm in the mood for a different sort of party, Nama is quick to oblige. For instance, the wasabi hummus is truth. Get ready for your next addiction. The miso soup does skew a bit to the salty side, but I like salt. I don't quite get how the crab & asiago dip fits in to the Japanese point of view but after the first taste, I decided to stop asking questions and to eat more. I could put a tub of that away. The salad offerings aren't as successful, in my experience. I've found the house salad to be watery and the seaweed salad to have an off-putting aftertaste. No worries. More dip & hummus for me. Then there's the hot food. Try this. Order this. Put this into your rotation. I don't know of other restaurants in town offering this slice of Japanese life and you're gonna want it. Both the katsudon and the currydon are fantastic blends of protein, vegetables, rice, and spice. One comes with egg. The other comes a little sweeter. They're both flavor bombs that may make you forget about sushi altogether.It's important to know what you're getting in to when you go to Nama. Here you're getting an elevated food experience without snobbery. Yes, the price point is higher than what you get at a mom & pop joint but this isn't a mom & pop joint. Nama may not be your all day every day sushi joint but once you check out the breadth and depth of the menu, it'll become part of your Friday night rotation. Definitely.*No shade.

The FULL price rolls would easily break the bank, but Monday is Half Price Roll day (From a select Menu) and fortunately includes several types, without including the entire menu.We started off with Miso soup which really is my only major complaint with this place. The bowl they serve the (full price) Miso soup in is so shallow that the spoon doesn't even hit the bottom.  It's over before it starts! I felt like they might as well have put my soup in the bowl you put your Soy Sauce in!Otherwise, we had the Pizza Roll, Crunchy Shrimp, Tempura and Orange Crush roll. The Pizza Roll was the one I disliked the most.  Its well made, it just had something I can't quite pin down about it I didn't care for. On the other hand, the Orange Crush was the biggest surprise. It was quite sweet and a unique take on Sushi. I absolutely recommend trying that one.In the end, the price is the barrier to me.

However this is easily the most expensive sushi restaurant in Nashville. Unfortunately our experience was poor: several prices of nigiri had skin on them, maki rolls (just rice, fish and seaweed wrapper) were mostly rice with strips of fish skinnier than a nickel, low sodium soy sauce had been refilled with regular soy sauce, miso soup was tiny (5 spoon fills; no kidding). The food prep was not consistent either, as re-orders were sometimes better and sometimes worse but never the same. We might try again in a couple of months and hope the food prep issues have been worked out. But price points should also be adjusted for what is plated.

After we were seated I looked at the drink menu and was surprised at how much they offered. They had a really long wine and sake list that I was eager to try. Alright Virago, you're winning me over at this point.What really won me over was the jalapeno yellowtail for starters. Holy hell was that good. It was such a good cut of fish, it literally melted in your mouth. After that I threw all caution into the wind, unhinged my jaw like an anaconda, and ate everything they brought out to me.

Pros: The decor of the restaurant was nice and I liked watching the sushi chefs crafting the sushi. The cocktail menu was cute and the drinks were quite delicious! The menu offers sushi options as well as hot food which was great. The miso cauliflower was pretty delicious as an appetizer. Cons: It was really difficult to get ahold of our server. We probably didn't get to order until 20-25 minutes after we sat down and took equally as long to get food. It's not that the food itself was bad, but it took so long to get served and the food was mostly just okay (we got sashimi and maki mono). Also, the prices are a little high compared to other M Street restaurants. Overall: For me, it was difficult to justify the prices despite the convenience to my apartment.

As for trendiness, this venue certainly turned it up to eleven. The seating felt hip, the lighting was cool, the menu options were familiar with a twist.

Our drinks took a bit to arrive, but also, no biggie...at first.Our food took ages and it all came out at different times...some people were completely finished with their entrees by the time some people received their entire meal. Side dishes were served about 30 minutes after the entrees.One food runner spilled a hot bowl of brussel sprouts on a member of our party. No apology, no towel to help clean it up.This is about the time we asked to speak with a manager. Our waiter forgot to get the manager. Meanwhile, another girl had ordered a drink and the waiter forgot about it for another half an hour. When he finally brought it (after her asking for it again...), the ENTIRE drink was spilled all over the back of another member of our party. Once again, no apology and no towel. Actually, right after he spilled the drink on her, the waiter literally RAN AWAY and didn't return.Someone finally got up and asked the hostess for the manager and we were told that ""he wasn't on site.""""The manager"" finally came over, told us that one of the girls who was spilled on wouldn't have a bill, as well as the bride to be, and that the edamame would be on the house. It took asking for the bills 3 times and about another half an hour to receive our bills (some girls didn't even receive theirs). We were t trying to pay so we could escape for about an hour, but we legitimately could not leave.I would NEVER recommend this place, in fact, I will be telling anyone I know traveling to Nashville to avoid it.",Virago,6152541902.0,17.0,2014-09-22,"Saint Louis, MO",/biz/virago-nashville-2,1.0,290,"Nashville, TN",Kelley M.,36.1622296,-86.774353,38.62727329999999,-90.19788890000001,253.6988980498554,False,1880.0

"1126 McGavock StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"While attending a blogger dinner a few weeks ago at Moto, another M Street restaurant kept popping up in conversation. Everyone at the table loved Virago and went on & on about it. Since I have never been (confession: I went once for cocktails ~4 years ago at the old location but ate nothing because I was a broke grad student) we decided it was high time we venture back to the Gulch to check out Nashville's swankiest place for sushi.Virago is a very cool place. So cool that they kinda hide the door from you. The entry to the restaurant is down a little alley and to the left, with only a tiny sign giving any indication you're in the right place. I'll be honest and say that we scoped out the wrong end of the building before doing a face-plam and walking down the alley to find the actual door. On the way we walked passed this beautiful outdoor patio which I can only imagine is blissful in the summertime.The decor of Virago has major sex appeal. Everything is dark with low lighting, warm tones and comfortable seats. Everyone looks sexy in low-light and I realized that this is a perfect date spot. Why in my many years of dating in Nashville did no dude ever take me here? WHY? Overall, it reminded me of some of the fancier hotels I have been in. This place is very hip and I thought I wouldn't be cool enough to get a table or get the staff to look at me. I was quite wrong about that. The clientele were just regular people out for a nice meal. There were regularly dressed people my age, some bedazzled ladies ready for a night on the town, and a table that looked like my parents. I guess I shouldn't stress about stuff like this- but I do.The cocktail list was very impressive and many of the drinks sounded good, making it a tough choice. I ordered the pear-lavender cocktail made with gin, lavender syrup and pear nectar. I really loved this drink and I might come back just to sip it at the bar. It had a gentle floral flavor that enhanced the notes in the gin. Steve ordered the ginger and lychee mojito and it was very sweet from the lychee flavor. But it was a subtle, light sweetness. It was good, but I liked mine better.For an appetizer we chose the ninja bacon, which is a crispy pork belly covered in squid ink after it's been cooked sous vide for 40 hours. It's served with red curry and coconut milk gels and dehydrated pineapple powder. YOWZA! That's a lot of flavors but it all worked really nicely together. The dehydrated pineapple was light and fluffy and added just a bit of sweet before it melted away in your mouth. I especially liked the mixture of the sweet coconut milk gel with the saltiness of the pork belly. We went all out on the sushi. The first roll was the Phantom (tempura calamari, poblano pepper, cucumber, and avocado wrapped in black rice with soy tobiko, balsamic soy, sriracha). This roll was really soft on the palate and it seemed to melt in your mouth. I was quite happy that the soy didn't overpower the roll, making it taste like salt and nothing else. Everything blended well together, and I love the sushi chef's attention to detail in the presentation.Next up was the honey fire (tempura shrimp, eel, Asian pear, jalapeño and honey fire sauce), which had a pleasing sweet and tangy heat that was very addicting. This sauce would make some killer chicken wings, just saying. I loved the crunch of the fresh roe on top but I wish the eel was just a tad bit warmer. I like my eel warm because it creates a nice opposition to the cold rice and veggies. Next up was the white dragon (shrimp, tuna, avocado, cucumber, pickled onions, cilantro and wasabi mayo, wrapped in hamachi and topped with sesame). The hamachi was very fresh and of very high quality. I loved the addition of the fresh scallion which added a fresh cooling flavor to balance out the heat of the sriracha.For dessert we got a sweet sushi roll: The Hawaii Five-O (soy wrap, hamachi, escolar, hearts of palm, avocado, cream cheese and mango inside, rolled in toasted coconut, wrapped in kiwi, topped with honey fire sauce and macadamia nuts). There was so much going on here, but again the complexity worked out nicely. This roll also used that amazing honey fire sauce, but mixed with the fresh fruit and cream cheese it became more sweet. The toasted coconut covered the rice and was amazingly delicious. The only sad thing here was that the taste of the fish itself got buried under all the other flavors.  I loved my dinner at Virago. Every dish was well prepared and beautifully presented. The cocktail list is outstanding and the service was topnotch.

"1126 McGavock StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"From start to finish, our experience with Virago was top notch and have never had anything like it. I'll just mention two key factors that made this experience worth the $$ :1. Atmosphere. My husband and I are fairly new to Nashville and very new to big city life. We love experiencing different places. The atmosphere in Virago is superb. From the outside appearance, feeling like your escaping to a hidden gem, to the inside lighting, music, and ambiance.. We felt like we were VIP from the get go. It's a very ""chill"" scene, just our style. 2. Service. We had the best Waiter we've had in years. We recommend Nate with two thumbs up. He recommended things without us asking, walked us through the menu, and made us feel at home. We are not picky eaters so we tried everything he recommended, from starters to dessert and we cannot say enough about how much we enjoyed our food. Recommendations: Miso Cauliflower as a starter. My husband doesn't even like cauliflower and he could not stop eating it. We are sushi eaters (and they also have other Japanese style food you can choose from) so: my husband got The Bomb roll which is literally.. The Bomb. We have eaten many of a sushi, but this roll was by far our favorite thing ever, hands down. Nate also recommended The Equador which is also a popular roll and that's what I got. It was mouth watering and fresh tasting. But if you're truly looking for a sushi taste you'll love forever, do yourself a favor and order The Bomb. Oh, and for dessert do the Mochi.. Our waiter described it as ice cream with a shell of a gummy bear.. And that's exactly how it tasted except better.

I am thrilled to find a great restaurant or service provider. I love nothing better than to have an amazing experience and I would (and have!) happily paid hundreds of dollars for the privilege. It's when I pay hundreds of dollars (or even a few dollars) to have a terrible experience that I get upset.Speaking of...Virago is like a very pretty girl (or guy) who is all looks and no substance. Once you get inside you want a little something more, if you know what I mean. And so it was with this expensive waste of calories. Visually it was fantastic. Little Buddhas and Asian statues? Loved it. Lighting? Wall art. Staff uniforms. Fabulous. Food? Awful. Service? Sucked.Like truly awful. Like amazingly awful. Like the kind of awful you have to tell people about. So here goes...Yes, I recently moved here from Los Angeles - home of amazing sushi. I take that into account and I still come up with the verdict: awful. I'm not scared. I've eaten sushi from Publix here in Nashville and you know what? It was better. And so was the price tag. We paid almost $75 for 3 rolls and a glass of wine and one after the other they were all worse than the last. Even the wine--my faithful friend--tasted like dishwater. Strange. The fish was mushy and off-color, we're not in danger of food poisoning, but we were definitely shocked at the quality. And why does almost every roll include something tempura (fried) and cream cheese or mayo? I feel like the good people of Nashville are more than ready to break away from their eating stereotypes, is it strange that the Virago chef doesn't agree? And the service. Oh my. Nice enough server, but honey, learn to multi-task. A glass of wine should not take 20 minutes to arrive. Soy sauce in a sushi restaurant should be on the table, not have to be requested from 2 (TWO!) different servers and still take 10 minutes to make it to the table. And the check? When two people are sitting there with coats on holding their purses and craning around to find you...probably not a good idea to walk by and then attempt to walk by again without acknowledging your impatient diners. Just a tip that must not have come with the training.All I ask from sushi are at least two out of these three things:1. Be fresh.2. Taste good.3. Don't make me sick. Virago delivered on one. And, yes, I realize this is landlocked Nashville. Does that mean that good sushi can only ever be a fantasy? Ever been to Japonais in Chicago? Incredible! Food AND decor.

"1126 McGavock StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"If your heart desires an upscale, trendy, Asian fusion place and you're not on a budget, Virago may be your soul-mate. This review is from the perspective of someone who dined on the patio.On a week night its no problem to make a reservation in advance to get a seat on the patio. The patio is really was solidified my experience, and it was intimate and felt kind of club like (in a good way!). The seating includes lounge-esque booths, or tables with a better view and they played house music that was muted enough to just really be background noise and drown out your neighbors conversation. Pending good weather the patio really is too cool, it provides an awesome look at the downtown Nashville skyline. Virago setting: 5 out of 5 stars. The food standouts - The crispy brussels sprouts side order... random? Yes, but they were cooked perfect and just a little crunchy and enough salty. MMM! Also on the random but tasty train, I recommend the Shishito Peppers as well, again crispy and savory. My friend had the Stoned Steak Filet which is raw pieces of beef filet and a 1200 degree stone for you to cook the pieces of beef. She said the portions were just right, and it came with two sauces that she said were great! Who doesn't like some fun and interactive dining with a blazing hot rock?We ordered 3 sushi rolls and if you're new to sushi or not feeling adventurous 'The Godzilla' roll was a safe, sure bet. 'The Bomb' roll came in at $19 and was more of a bomb in my wallet. It comes with baked crab meat on top, and they really don't skimp on this which all sushi lovers can appreciate. The unagi sauce was too sweet though and took over the flavor of the roll. If you're going to call something 'the bomb', it better be really f***ing good. Avoid - Steer clear of the 'Rising Sun' roll. Everything in the roll was mushy, and something in it did not taste fresh, 2 day drive to the ocean anybody? The tempura crunch was lacking the crunch. It would have really benefitted from the texture and freshness of say, a cucumber. The Sweet Soy Edamame is a horrible thing to serve on the menu. Yea sure they tasted alright, but the sweet soy sauce was so incredibly sticky and thick, I needed a wet nap when I was done. Why would you serve finger-food edamame drenched in a sticky mess? Sauce on the side = problem solved. Being from California I have some pretty high expectations for fresh sushi. The sushi at Virago was pretty good, but not THE BOMB. Like I said, the patio was perfect, service was great, and luckily we were celebrating an occasion and could justify going to a spendier place. I'm sure you could get similar quality sushi for a better price elsewhere in Nashville, you're just paying for the scene at Virago. 5/5 for atmosphere, 3.5/5 for food.",Virago,6152541902.0,124.0,2013-08-14,"Nashville, TN",/biz/virago-nashville-2,4.0,290,"Nashville, TN",Chelsea J.,36.1622296,-86.774353,36.1622296,-86.774353,0.0,True,2770.0

Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, in fact it's more like what I consider good but the price to value ratio kind of kills it for me.

I met up with a friend of a friend for a TedX Nashville mixer and drove into ""the Gulch"". Virago is like a t-shirt millionaire. From the outside, he don't look like much, but when you go into his house you realize ""Man, this dude is a baller!"" Virago felt like I was climbing into the mind of my boyfriend. He loves modern design and he would have thought Virago to be only one word: Sick. Not in a bad, ""she looks sick like anorexic Karen Carpenter"" kind of way, but an ""uh your new Bentley is sick and you're getting laid for the rest of your life"" kind of way. The design is gorgeous with clean lines and bits of Jonathan Adler whimsy sprinkled here and there. There are conclaves of seating throughout the venue for meetings or making out with Ryan Gosling. I sampled a bit of the food which ranged from maki sushi to teriyaki turkey balls. I could have stuffed fifty of those balls in my mouth...but I'm a lady. Don't quote me on that one.The staff is very nice and Virago reminds me of something I'd see in LA, except without the douche bags and fake boobs. I do not think that Virago is for everyone, some may think it's too fancy because they prefer a divey bar where the floor is sticky and the bathrooms have no doors. But it's certainly a place I would frequent often if I lived in Nashville and had the chance to make out with Ryan Gosling. It's an ""I wipe my butt with $20 bills"" kind of cool.

"1126 McGavock StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Came out to have ladies night out stopped to have sushi & drinks. And was mistreated by a server and his regular customer! My friend & I were waiting for seats at the bar, because we were told that is the only place for open seating! We were told it was a 15-20 minute wait. However, there was empty booths as you walk toward the bar area, there were empty tables around the bar area, & empty seats in the area where the glass is where you can see the sushi. Ok, now trying to be understanding that the hostess said that these seats noted above are all only sat by reservation only. We opted to go sit at the bar while waiting for our seats. Well we were hanging around the bar waiting for someone to get up and I spotted two ladies getting ready to leave so I start to take off my coat so that we could sit down. As I was walking up to put my things down this crazy woman comes up an just throws her things into one of the chairs we were waiting on. She could't say she didn't know we were waiting for the seats cause she seen us standing near the seats, and plus her and a group of her friends were seated by the far end of the Dj booth on the couch. But, what ultimately pissed me off even more is the server Kyle knows he seen us waiting for these seats! Yet he chose not to say anything to his friend! Why you ask I assume it is a friend, because they hugged and spoke to each other across the bar!! I don't care if she is a freaking regular customer or not. On principal,we should have got those seats and he being in the customer service field should have made the situation right, but no he didn't even apologize. I probably would have even accepted if he he said he would make sure we were seated once two open seats came up! Did I mention he took the other woman' s drink order before mine, and I was there first! So i over hear this crazy woman say to her buddies that she has been coming here for four years like I give a Sh! Then she proceeds to get up telling another one of her friends she can have her seat. So I voiced my opinion that the seat should be ours and she proceeds to say that I don't have to leave. And in response I told her I didn't give a damn if she did or didn't! So she sits right there for the rest of the time. But, before I go I requested to speak to the manager. After explaining to the manager why I was so upset with my visit he says to me, did I tell the bartender (Kyle) that I was waiting for these seats. And in reply I said to the so called manager ""why would I have to tell him if I was standing there behind the seats""!!! Obviously I was not close up to touch the seats cause I respect people's personal space wanted to give the ladies leaving room enough to put their coats on and gather their purses! And as for that 15-20 minute reservation she called after I left and was in my car pulling out of the parking lot across the street from Whiskey Kitchen! Did I also mention that 4 booths that were once empty we're now seated with people as we were walking out! Even a table in the bar area! Overall, this was the worst cust srvc I have encountered in dining out! I use to tell lots of people about virago! Cause I myself have known about them for 4+ years, but I don't go everyday, every week or weekend because I fortunately have a life outside of the bar!! I have a husband & children, but the one night I decide to take my cousin that has never been to virago and receive this kind of treatment!!! Needless to say I will not be back & anyone else I know I will discourage them going there as well!!! I wouldn't set someone up to potentially be treated with the non caring attitude & behavior I experienced here on Saturday night 2/15/14 around 10 pm. I don't know if they have a GM but trust me if they do I would certainly tell them they need a nice talk with the mgr & the bartender!! I gave this 1 star but I'm actually thinking this deserves -5 stars!! Even 1 star is too much in my book!! If you are a customer reading this I advise you take your own risk, but in my opinion you can get better sushi somewhere else along with GREAT service to back it up! The best thing going for virago is the decor and the location it's in!! Cause the staff's cust srvc skills is seriously lacking!! Other than that why bother!!! And FYI, another lady that was there was telling my friend & I that she was given the worst bar attention ever! She was seated on the other side of the bar when you first come down the stairs to the bar from the lobby & had been waiting awhile for someone to take her drink order! She had to get up & come over to the side the Dj booth is on in order to give her order for a bottle of wine! Take it from someone who knows!

"1126 McGavock StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I had the WORST experience I have ever had at a restaurant. Before you think I am being dramatic....please read my review and judge for yourself. I am good at managing my expectations for a restaurant based on the kind of restaurant. When I am going to Virago, an M Street restaurant, I have high expectations on all levels: decor, service, food.I went here with three other girls for a gf's birthday dinner. Our reservations were for a Monday night since some rolls are half price and there are drink specials.  The waitress came over and was super friendly. I explained right off the bat (before we even ordered drinks) that I had dietary needs/questions. I could not eat the white sushi rice. Now I know what you're thinking....who goes to a sushi place if they do not want to eat white rice, but it was for a bday. This is why I wanted to get all my questions out of the way with the waitress right up front. I asked if rolls could be made without white rice, if they had brown sushi rice (which I knew was probably a no), etc. They did not have brown rice to substitute which was fine. She said I could order any roll without rice. She even mentioned at one point they could substitute crab mix for the rice. She asked if I wanted the hand roll style as opposed to the regular roll, and I said no thank you. So I ordered a couple rolls off the Monday half off menu. All the other girls ordered as well. A few minutes later, the waitress came back out and apologized because the kitchen informed her that rolls on the half of menu cannot have modifications. She said but you can order any other roll on the regular menu without rice. No big deal, so I did just that. I ordered the octopus appetizer and a roll off the regular menu.In the mean time, everyone else's food comes out. I'm eating my octopus salad and everyone else is eating their rolls. One of the managers (Oleg) brings out the roll I ordered and walks away. I look at it and there is rice in it. So when he was walking back, we stopped him. I explained that my roll was not supposed to have rice on it. He looked confused and said ok and took it away. Shortly after the waitress comes back out. She apologized, said she got confused and thought that I had given up on the ""no rice"" thing. I apologized for the miscommunication and that I still wanted that roll but with no rice. She mentioned using crab mix again to hold it together, I said that was fine. Then she informed me that sushi was now taking 45 minutes to leave the kitchen so it would be 45 minutes before it would be ready. By this time, the other three girls were done eating and I was starving. Naturally I was like can't you bump it to the front of the line since there has been a couple mix ups? She said she could not but that a manager could. We said ok, send a manager over.Over walks Oleg (same guy who brought me the roll initially). Right off the bat I could tell he was on the defense even before anybody started talking. Hey, I used to work in retail and was a manager. I know it is not always fun dealing with customers when they ask to speak to a manager. But at the same time, your job as manager is to deal with customers. His arms are crossed in front of him and he asks what's going on. I explained the whole story to him. His response was ""So what exactly do you want? You can't have sushi without rice? My waitress says she offered you a hand roll and you said no, so what do you want?"" I was a little shocked at the way he was talking to me, but I calmly said that the waitress told me I could have any roll on the menu with no rice. So I guess that's where things got confused. One of the women I was with started to talk, and no joke, he says, ""I'm not talking to you I'm talking to her."" She then says ""Did you just raise your voice at me?"" He then says ""I can't talk to all of you at the same time I can only talk to her."" At this point I was appalled. Never experienced anything like this. I don't like when a guy raises his voice at a woman, especially when it is an employee at a restaurant to women that are strangers to him. I decided it just needed to be shut down and we needed to leave. I said ""I don't want to order anything else, cancel my second glass of wine, we are ready for the check. We want to leave."" He said fine and walked away.I wish someone could have taken a pic of our faces. We were all shocked. This was my first time at Virago. All the girls were like it is not like this normally, I have never experienced anything like this, etc. I felt bad for my friends bday because now she was not having fun.Then the GM, Sean, came over. He was really nice. I explained to him what happened. He apologized on Oleg's behave, tried to offer us a free dessert, etc. We said no thank you we just wanted to leave. He apologized again, we paid our check and left. It would have been nice if they comped the Bday girls glass of wine or something.

"1126 McGavock StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"So I was torn between assigning them a 3 star or 4 because they really aren't a sushi restaurant and is priced relatively high for the quality of sushi they offer compared to the same quality of sushi that would find in LA, NY, and any metropolitan area that's next to an ocean, but if you look at it as sushi in consideration of Nashville, Virago is definitely quite a find.I don't consider them a traditional sushi restaurant per se because they have a heavier focus on rolls (which is not traditional sushi), and offer a very general selection among nigiri sushi which can be found in just about every sushi restaurant (i.e. tuna, salmon, yellowtail, snapper, etc.).  They also seem to have quite a bit of fusion dishes that don't figure into a normal sushi restaurant.  Call me a traditionalist, but when I think of sushi, Virago's menu is not something that fits the profile for me.When you factor that out of the equation though, Virago as a whole is a very good Asian fusion restaurant.  Their rolls are pretty good and the nigiri sushi that I've had there makes me reconsider my original belief that a place like Nashville couldn't possibly have safe and delicious sushi.  They also offer a nice variety of cocktails that compliments their modern fusion settings (I am particularly fond of their Wasabi Martini).  Service here is also really friendly, but that might simply be a result of the premium you pay here and the fact that this is the South, and not LA.  Rather than come here for simply sushi, For me, this place is a nice place to come celebrate if you want some it to come with a side of Asian fusion.Price: 3Service: 4.5Food: 4",Virago,6152541902.0,75.0,2012-11-07,"San Francisco, CA",/biz/virago-nashville-2,4.0,290,"Nashville, TN",Ray L.,36.1622296,-86.774353,37.7792768,-122.41927040000002,1963.4667482795255,False,1654.0

We had appetizers and a million sushi rolls. My personal favorites were the phantom and the surf and turf. Delish. The atmosphere is hip and modern...swanky, if you will. I was told by one of the girls that lives locally that the socially required dress was very fancy. However, I found it more casual than she had said.

Also, while it's often suggested to sit at the bar at sushi spots, I would suggest holding out for a table.

If this was a review of simply the food I would give it a strong 4 Stars, however, tonight's dining experience left much to be desired. My girlfriend and I arrived at the restaurant quite a bit early and decided to see if we could be seated, anticipating that we probably would not be based on the fact we were almost an hour early which is understandable on a Friday night. The group of hostesses at the front told us we couldn't be seated until closer to our reservation time and that they would come find us if any tables opened up. We decided to enjoy some Sake at the bar to pass the time until our table was ready and sat within clear view of the entrance in case anything opened up early. Half an hour prior to our reservation time we noticed multiple tables left open around us that remained open until our reservation time. After noticing the hostesses weren't leaving their post to find anyone I went up to their station to inquire about our table. I was then informed that our table was ready, it just so happened to be one of the ones we observed had been opened for nearly half an hour prior to being seated. Our server, Alexander, was prompt to greet us but his service was completely lacking after the initial contact. After dropping off our water he disappeared for nearly ten minutes before coming back to ask us about drinks and we had to tell him that we wanted to order appetizers before he briskly disappeared again. He eventually returned to take the remainder of our order and deliver our appetizer, a manager had to come clear our empty plates before being able to bring us out our entrees. The manager stopped and commented something to our server in passing which appeared to be over the dirty dishes left on our table for over 5 minutes. The manager soon quickly reappeared with our entrees. The rest of the duration of our meal was spent trying to flag down our waiter for service only to receive service from the waitress in the section next to ours. Our actual server went as far as trying to act busy to avoid giving us any form of addition help. It was clear he was looking to close out his shift and head home.

The place was not full when we showed up and we were seated right away. That is where the experience ceased being enjoyable. Ordered a bottle of wine, it was half price or some sort of deal, lucky me. This bottle of wine happened to be white, unfortunately super server brought me a bottle of red wine. I sent it back and asked for the correct bottle, he looked at me like I didnt know I ordered a bottle of white. After some significant searching, they finally dug it out of the depths of their extensive wine cellar. Then we ordered food, a variety of rolls including some of the specialty(expensive ass) rolls. The first rolls they brought out way earlier than the others. Generally, I prefer to eat my meal all at once, but apparently they felt like serving us shit at different times. After inspecting the first set of rolls that came out, I quickly realized that they came out first because they weren't freshly prepared, they were obviously premade. The rice was all dry and the fish was shitty. Then the other rolls came out, and they were certainly not worth the retarded amount of money charged for them. Listen, I know all the cool motherfuckers on town go to this place and go because they don't care how shitty it is for the money.

Honestly, the ONLY reason why she changed her tune with me, is because I ordered $130 food pre tip, FOR MYSELF. She was still consistently rude to everyone else in our party. The portions of the food are pretty small. The lobster fried rice was good, but not for a small portion for $9 good. I ordered their anniversary roll that was a combination of two of their normal specialty rolls, and they failed to mention that it was basically the same price as both rolls combined.

"1126 McGavock StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"PROS: V2 edamame appetizer, spicy tuna, crunchy california roll, mochi ice cream dessert- the view, nice decor and ambiance on the rooftop dining areaCONS: miso spinach side dish is really bland, service was pretty slow, tofu and eggplant robatayaki blandWent to Virago for dinner last Monday evening with three friends. We sat at a booth table at the upstairs outdoor patio dining area. I LOVE that space- open, private booth tables, great view of downtown. It was a perfect night- no cicadas, cooler than it has been, clear skies.We went at 7pm, and there were plenty of available tables- however, by the time we left around 9pm, the entire area (tables plus bar) were occupied. There were several larger parties as well as smaller couples/groups.We started with the V2 EDAMAME (I get it EVERY Time and i love it every time)- it's wok charred spicy edamame and it's totally addictive. Large bowl of it, and an extra bowl to toss discarded pods. We all shared the bowl, it was gone in no time.we also ordered the SHRIMP SUMMER ROLL- it was slightly crunchy fried on the outside but didn't have a deep fried oily feel. It came with a slightly sweet dipping sauce. Overall though the roll was slightly bland in flavor. I probably wouldn't order it again.I went with something I've never ordered before- the ROBATAYAKI items, I got the tofu and the eggplant. Both were small items, probably would have been better as side orders in accompaniment to a main entree dish or some sushi. Both were good- not amazingly good but not bad. I doubt I'd order either again- although at $4 each they're not pricey. I just feel like they're items I could make at home.in case anyone is wondering (because I didn't know this at the time)- the robatayaki is not grilling by the table. i think i misunderstood the description on the menu and for some reason thought it would be like table-side grilling. It's not- the items are just grilled, come out on a regular plate as usual.My friend ordered the SPICY TUNA ROLL (his stand-by roll at every sushi joint) which was solid. I judge every sushi place by how they make spicy tuna roll- and this was overall good. Not too much extra rice, not too heavy on the mayonnaise but good flavor and spice.He also ordered the CRUNCHY CALIFORNIA roll- I liked it, I think there were tempura flakes which added the crunch but it wasn't dry.The loser dish was the MISO SPINACH that my girl friend ordered- she didn't even finish half of it, and I tried it. Kind of bland and a little too ""spinach-y"" tasting if that makes sense. Not that flavorful.The TANGLED GREENS LETTUCE salad looked great- blue cheese, nuts, light vinaigrette.We also all ordered MOCHI ice cream for dessert (got an assortment of flavors including Lychee, chocolate, vanilla, blueberry- all were delicious, perfectly chilled, chewy and flavorful).In the past I've had THE BOMB ROLL which other reviewers have mentioned- it really is awesome! i looooved it. Can't comment on the drinks because this time (Mon night)- two out of four of us didn't drink. One friend had a Sapporo beer, the other had a glass of red wine.Total check (which we split evenly 4 ways) ended up ~$25 per person including one drink each, splitting appetizers, our individual main dishes/rolls, and dessert. I think that's not bad at all given great views, and sushi meals always tend to be pricey.Overall- a great evening and meal with friends. One complaint would be extreme slow service with getting drinks out and then eventually getting around to ordering food. Our server was sweet and fun so I hate to complain - I think the slow service may have been more to do with few servers out on the rooftop area? My girl friend valet parked which is super easy and convenient and pretty much the way to go (valet is complimentary= free). I parked at a lot across the street, next to Whiskey Kitchen- very few available spots, and we parked in the way back in a very tight spot.ps- other reviews have commented on how they felt under-dressed or this place seems intimidating because of crowd and decor. i would say this shouldn't be a deterrent to anyone nor do I think it's a major issue. The table next to us had patrons with tattoos and very hip alternative clothing. My friends wore jeans and casual shirts (the guys) and the girls had casual sundresses- we didn't feel out of place AT ALL.

All of the women, including the employees, do not eat at the restaurant.  I'm not sure that they eat at all with their figures.  And the seeming prerequisite of 4 to 6 inch heels is crazy talk.  All of the men are equally of the tall, dark and handsome variety: well shaved and when unshaven it is the most stylish beard that one has ever seen.  So, take your beautiful body and get on over to Virago if you think you can hang.The seating is great though.  There are really comfortable couches near the bar for larger groups where you can mingle with your people, have a decent meal (we will get to food in a minute), and chat it up with the beautifuls around you.  Even the smaller tables are comfortable and placed well so that you never feel like you're in the way and always have a comfortable place to sit and see.The food has two kitchens and two menus:  sushi and more traditional. All food comes out tapas-style in that as soon as it has been prepared it is delivered to your table - there are no such thing as ""courses"" at Virago.  The sushi is mediocre compared to what you would get in the cities (NYC and LA) that this place is trying to be; however, it is some of the better sushi in Nashville - not that that says much, I suppose.  The robotayaki is generally really well done, with the exception of the chicken skin... don't get it.  But, the prices for the robotayaki feel a little bit steep.  You pay a lot for presentation I feel.  The traditional main courses like the Wagyu Sirloin, Wagyu filet, and the Wagyu prime (to which a tempura lobster tail can be added to just about any of them) are all fantastic.  Wagyu beef is the shiznit.  The side items is honestly one of the strengths of Virago and one of the few spots on the menu where the price and value equation seems fair.  I highly recommend the spicy green beans... they are to die for - especially if you like spice / a kick in the pants with your meal.So, here's why I struggle.  Four stars is ""Yay! I'm a fan"" and Three stars is ""A-OK"".  Well, I am a fan of their food but not their prices.  I am a fan of the seating arrangement but not their decor.  I am a fan of their servers (from a service perspective) but I am not a fan of feeling like I am not one of the pretty people.

Honestly, I've been to Nobu in Miami and the sushi there is top notch--but I have to say that Virago takes the number 1 sushi slot in Nashville.  Also great are the tempura green beans and gyoza.  ALWAYS get at least one of those for an appetizer!  The artisan cheese plate is the best in Nashville in my opinion too.  It's way more food than one person can eat, so make sure there are at least 2 or 3 of you!  Comes complete with 4 or 5 cheeses (including fried brie!) and grapes, strawberries, pineapple, or whatever is in season.  If you are serious about sitting at a table for dinner, call at least a day ahead for a reservation.  The bar is full service though and is first come first served.  If it's busy, expect slow service, but I've never had a bad experience there besides the crowd a few years back.  And I have to just blame that on my own close-mindedness.  Want great sushi, a chance to get dressed up (or at least out of your jeans), and stellar people-watching?  Check out Virago!",Virago,6152541902.0,374.0,2008-04-08,"Nashville, TN",/biz/virago-nashville-2,4.0,290,"Nashville, TN",Robin S.,36.1622296,-86.774353,36.1622296,-86.774353,0.0,True,1387.0
"1126 McGavock StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Virago holds a special place in my stomach because it first introduced me to perhaps one of the loveliest food items on the planet - sashimi.Let's rewind to seven years ago, I was a bright-eyed college freshman home for my first winter break when I went here with two friends who boasted incredibly discerning palates. We ordered saketinis (shh, I think they are stricter on IDs now) and tuna sashimi to start. My tastebuds desperately hung on for the first time experience. This is seven years later, mind you, and this part of the night is clear as a bell.  I never knew raw fish could taste this good.Since that first experience, I've had sashimi at nearly every sushi restaurant I have been to, thanks Virago for opening my eyes. I've also been back here multiple times, it has a really fun vibe, dim lighting and great music. Don't only get the sushi though, delicious rolls and hot menu items make this place a must stop if you are in Nashville.

"1126 McGavock StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Ok, I had to update my review and take a couple of stars off, which grieves my heart because I was probably one the biggest Virago fans in the world...but Virago has moved...and it has changed and not for the better, in my opinion. (Truth Note: If I had not loved the old Viragos so much and compared the new one to its old self, it may have gotten a 4 stars...just keep that in mind...)I met my husband at the old location of Viragos on my birthday, and it has become a regular tradition for us. What I loved about the old Viragos was that it was super nice, but it wasn't snobby. You could come in and modify an order with chicken or shrimp and the chefs were happy to accomodate. You didn't have to make reservations to get in -- you could always come and sit at the bar and end up being served. You could park  and didn't have to valet - it was pricey, but not ridiculous. It was a comfortable place - now not so much.Without a reservation, they tell you that there is a 2 hour wait although you literally are staring at open tables galore. I don't know if someone is going in and making reservations that they can't keep, but the old Viragos was not like that. Also, they have taken a lot of the menu and are not willing to substitue or modify it. My husband and I LOVED the stir fry, which is no longer on the menu. They have a lo mein option but it had lamb. I asked if I coud get shrimp instead and I got a big, ""No."" To me, a restaurant that can't substitute shrimp for lamb is not serving fresh food quality because I know they have shrimp. I was just hoping it wasn't served from a pre-made baggie, but oh well - it wasn't too bad, but it wasn't very good and was even more pricey than the old Viragos. The sushi didn't tase the same either and wasn't as fresh and mouth watering - it tasted just normal. I was crushed. The old Virago is dead and the new one is just not as good...On the upside, the new building that Virago's built is gorgeous and huge! It's worth it to at least go to see how they have it all set up - very Dallas and very modern -- it moved to the Gulch and is Gulch upper class. You can't help but admire its beauty - it has a lot more space in the restaurant and an upper deck patio area that you can reserve for parties - you can't smoke up there, even though it is outside, but the stairs lead down to the main smoking area. All in all, Virago's is still cool - it's an example of a small business that grew to be a big business and has become more corporate. Definitely check it out if you can, but it's no longer my favorite place...I am still searching Nashville for that important title!",Virago,6152541902.0,42.0,2010-02-07,"Nashville, TN",/biz/virago-nashville-2,3.0,290,"Nashville, TN",Sarah M.,36.1622296,-86.774353,36.1622296,-86.774353,0.0,True,2627.0

"1126 McGavock StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"So ... I'm a New Yorker, recently visited Nashville, taken by old friend to Virago when we settled on wanting sushi. It's not the worst sushi I've ever had by far, & also not the best. I would give this place 3 or even 4 stars except for the fact that this was perhaps the very worst service I have received at any restaurant in my entire lifetime. And I am not exaggerating. The waitress (who looks somewhat like a young Meryl Streep) must be either new or just coming out of a coma. She suggested we get appetizers because we'd not ordered nearly enough for our main course. Wrong. The main courses we ordered were enough for at least FOUR adults (there were only 2 of us). Then (get this), the main courses arrive BEFORE the appetizers (which, in fact, were NEVER served ... waitress said they must've gotten accidentally taken to another table, wtf????). I got a bad feeling when I arrived about 15 min ahead of my friend & was seated & promptly IGNORED the entire time before my friend arrived ... no ""can I get you something to drink?"", nothing. Literally, I had to get up, go to the hostess & ask her to please send somebody to take my drink order ... and STILL it was several minutes of waiting. Then, as my friend & I are wrapping up our dinner, we glance over & see our waitress sitting at a nearby booth, patiently wrapping knives & forks in napkins even before we've finished our meal!! Um, check please???? (Any restaurant that takes service seriously does not have waiters wrapping silverware at a booth while diners are still present, good god, who doesn't know THAT?? Maybe at a diner that's acceptable, but not a serious restaurant.) Look, I know I'm from New York, where a place like this would go under in about 5 minutes w/ this kind of horrendous service. Yes, I get that it is important to ""slow down"" & be patient when visiting the South, & normally I LOVE that things there operate at a more relaxed pace... that is, in fact, part of its charm. But this place takes nightmare service to a whole new level. Plus, it seems to be a bit of a ""scene,"" lots of loud, drunken, screaming girls at every other table.

"395 Haywood LnNashville, TN 37211",4.5,"This used to be the location of Thai Taste. We always enjoyed their food but they closed down a year or two ago. Then ThaiVille opened up with new owners. Those owners decided to rebrand the restaurant as Bangkokville Thai a few months after opening. We decided to give it a try. We stopped in around noon on Sunday & there was one couple at a different table. Not very busy, but that didn't detour us, I mean it's only been open for about 4 months by my calculations. We were greeted warmly & sat at a table & our drink order was taken. If you'd been to Thai Taste, the interior will be very familiar. They haven't change much. It's a nicely appointed restaurant for the age of the building. As we skimmed the menu (all with pictures), the owner stopped by & introduced himself & told us what dishes were his favorite & how this food is different than the other Thai places in Nashville. We decided on the crab Rangoon as an appetizer, I ordered the Pad Kee Mao & Phillip ordered some kind of pork dish. They've got a lunch & dinner price. There's about two dollars in price difference on the items. I told the server I wanted the lunch portion, seeing as it was lunchtime & I wasn't wanting a huge plate of food. She told us that on the weekends is only dinner portions. I thought that was a little odd but I figured we be getting a huge plate of food. The crab Rangoon came soon after. You can really tell they care about presentation here. They use a lot of flowers carved out of carrots & other vegetables. The crab Rangoon was okay. The won tong paper was really thick so it was kind of hard to bite into. I like it when the paper is more delicate & inside crab stuff is fluffy. The food arrived after we were done with the crab Rangoon. The ""dinner"" portion we got looked more like a lunch portion. I think the lunch/dinner portion on the weekend is probably just to make a few extra bucks. The menu didn't have anything on it about no lunch options on the weekend, however on the website, the new menu says dinner is from 11am-9pm on Saturday & Sunday. I enjoyed the Pad Kee Mao. The noodles were cooked well & the chicken was seasoned. I asked for spicy but it wasn't very spicy so we got the 3 little containers of spices. The bell peppers were a little soft for me.

"5109 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"Six years ago, my husband (boyfriend at the time) and I received a gift card to Sperry's that we chose to use on our second anniversary together.  Not only did we enjoy our overall experience so thoroughly that we came back again, we made it a point to come back on our anniversary annually, in addition to a roundabout half dozen other times throughout each proceeding year.  Last fall, we even hosted our rehearsal dinner at Sperry's and the event was spectacular.For special occasions, I don't hold back much when it comes to splurging but I like to know exactly how much of a splurge I am about to indulge in (and quite frankly, so does my wallet.)  When our waiter approached us for our drink order, I asked him about a few Chardonnays and which one was the oakiest within my price range ($9-$11/glass.)  I proceeded to have two total glasses throughout the duration of our meal.  He brought two samples and I picked my favorite.  When our waiter took our drink order, I ordered the Twin Lobster Tails (priced at $30.)  He then suggested I try their daily special, a jumbo lobster tail.  I told him I would be happy with that as long as the price was similar.  Upon receiving our check, I noticed the amount was far much higher than my husband and I have ever spent at any restaurant in our lives.  The wine he brought me was $13/glass and the lobster tail he up-sold was $65.  On top of my husbands two beers and his meal, our bill was over $165.  We spent over $200 after a tip.  Granted, I understand up-selling a customer but charging them for something over 100% more expensive than what they decided to order?  Much less, doing so blatantly when the customer had voiced their stance?  I'm still appalled and couldn't see myself returning for a good long while.UPDATE:  I only thought it was fair to contact the establishment directly before posting my public review of dissatisfaction.  (Hey, I'm an honest gal.)  So right before posting the above review, I wrote a very detailed letter to 'Whom it May Concern' and emailed it to the contact email on Sperry's website.  I stated exactly what I described here but went into more detail and description.  Less than 24 hours later, I receive a personal phone call from the GM showing what I have always remembered Sperry's for.  Good customer service is all about bringing customers back and Keith fell nothing short of this.  He showed his true concern, did not make excuses but rather embraced the situation with apology and thanking me for contacting them directly about my experience.  He didn't make promises he couldn't keep; instead, he offered a generous incentive to return and it was one that will also have me leaving happy.  He was helpful, courteous, and knowledgeable, took the extra step and gained not only my business back, but also the two stars I docked off originally.  This place knows what it's all about and they have proved it to me in more ways than one.",Sperry’s Restaurant,6153530809.0,62.0,2012-11-29,"Nashville, TN",/biz/sperrys-restaurant-nashville,5.0,57,"Nashville, TN",Charli J.,36.1622296,-86.774353,36.1622296,-86.774353,0.0,True,2962.0

"5109 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"Nashville is in need of a new legend. Having eaten at some of the finest steakhouses in the country, I can tell you this is far from an electrifying experience. Above all the steak didn't taste any better than what I could find at my local supermarket and slap on the grill at home. For the price, (my steak was almost $30) I would of expected at least grass-fed or an aged piece of meat with a signature steak sauce. What I found, was just a slab of meat on my plate I could of cooked up myself. No dressing, no signature sauce, no presentation whatsoever. Very disappointing. The salad bar is a joke. I have never been to a steakhouse and had to create my own salad. I would expect this at Jason's Deli or Wendy's, but not a premier steakhouse. Not to mention, the salad was not fresh and was absent any type of signature toppings or selections.In the end, the dessert was fine. I ordered the sticky toffee pudding. But the main course and side dishes were such a disappointment, it was hard to enjoy it. This restaurant is an excellent example of one that has somehow managed to survive on its reputation and history. Anyone with taste and experience with steakhouses outside these city limits, will have to admit this is among the worst.

I understand they are aiming for sophisticated and romantic, but it all feels a bit too dark and crowded for my tastes.Salad Bar - Small, but fresh. We made several trips and enjoyed the salad, mushrooms, olives, baby corn and dressings (honey mustard, vinaigrette, etc.)Service - Our waiter Steven was professional and friendly, even when it became clear that we weren't big spenders.Steaks - Impressive. Really better than I expected from having read some of the other reviews. My 8 oz. filet mignon in particular was tender and cooked just right. I thought my wife's ribeye had slightly less flavor and may have been just a bit on the well done side of medium, but it was pretty darn tasty too. Side - The creamed spinach was fantastic. Many restaurants tend to overload this dish with cream. Sperry's got it just right and made the spinach the star of the show.Value - Sperry's is usually pretty pricey for a Nashville restaurant, but we came on Labor Day when all entrees (except the lobster tails) were half price. That meant instead of spending in the high $20s for excellent steaks, we got them for the low teens. Fantastic value. Plus the salad bar is included with all entrees! Amazing.If you have deep pockets, this is a good restaurant any time. Otherwise, keep an eye out for the specials and you can have a lovely meal at a relatively affordable price. Our bill totaled less than $50 including tax and tip and we've got leftover steak in the fridge for tomorrow. That's hard to beat.(PS - There is a tiny open kitchen visible on the other side of the salad bar. Is all the restaurant's food really emerging from that kitchen? If so, the chef deserves a major award for superior performance under difficult conditions.

"5109 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"The provided photo (a lighted interior shot) threw me a little bit. The owners keep this old-school restaurant dark, presumably in an attempt to foster an intimate ambiance, but I found myself wanting a flashlight (or a headlight, maybe?) to navigate between the tables, especially when I first entered the restaurant. As my eyes acclimated, I took in the scene -- it looked like the kind of place the Rat Pack might have frequented in an old time movie: dark wood, candle light, 1970's decor. The restaurant actually has been there since the mid 70's, and it's not hard to see why: A focused menu, diligent service, and fantastic food make Sperry's a destination worth revisiting. Most, if not all, entrees at Sperry's come with a trip to the salad bar. I don't always love salad bars -- the worst are usually neglected relics of 1980's remodel jobs -- this one was worth visiting. The salad bar was small, but filled with fresh choices and all the essentials. (Real and varied lettuce types, fresh tomatoes, real bacon, lots of cheese.) I ordered the ""Prince William"" -- (not to be confused with a Prince Albert) -- a blue cheese-stuffed fillet, wrapped with bacon ($26). The blue cheese was mild, but the steak was very solid, over all, and I would recommend it again. My only criticism is that the fillet, a small steak, was served on a large plate, which made it look rather lonely without any side dishes to accompany it. I also ordered the creamed spinach, which was lovely, and tasted more of spinach than of cream, but added an extra $4 to an already expensive bill. My dinner companion ordered another steak (also excellent) with a twice-baked potato, which was ordinary, but acceptable. Worth noting: the 6 oz steak, the salad bar, and the baked potato is about enough food for even the hungriest.

And for my wife who has given to me everything I hold dear: her love, and our children.As of now, I dedicate my reviews people. Deal. I was staying at the soulless Gaylord so it was a real treat for me to come to BB's soulful blues club. Im gonna break it down for ya. *The Ride There*I bought the shuttle ride from  the Gaylord to the Wild Horse Saloon and walked to BB's. It was 15 dollars round trip, compared to 50 bucks round  trip for a taxi.*The Music*I went there on a Monday which apparently is a night that The Stacy Mitchhart Band regularly plays. They were great. They could work a croud, they could work the drums, the sax, the horn, the guitar, the bass, and  the piano. *The Drinks*I ordered  the Hoochie Coochie. I loved it. I had 3 of them. I followed it up with a Stella Artois. *The Food*I ordered a simple chicken sandwich with bacon and cheese and some darn fine Bar-B-Que sauce. I subbed the fries for Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was pretty good. The portion could have been larger, and there was a meager substitution charge. But they were good. The portion size may not have been what I wanted, but it was more than I needed. The sandwich with the sauce was D -lish. Ous. Delicious. The sandwich comes with a pickle spear, but my server being the bad a$$ she is snagged me some extra at my request. This brings me to  the most important section.*The Service *Imagine something really cool that's happened to you like winning a raffle or watching someone pitch a perfect game live. These are some of the many feelings I felt after being served by Kindle. She was prompt, courteous, friendly as all get-out, and cute as a button. A really freaking cute button. She was the cat's purr which I think we can all agree is by far better than the cat's meow. Thank you for your service, Kindle. You deserve a raise.I was so smitten by the music, the food, and Kindle by the end of the night Kindle could have poured Bar-B-Que sauce on me and I would have cooly replied, ""I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience my body or my white shirt has caused your exquisite Bar-B-Que sauce. I assure you such impropriety will never occur again.""*The Ride Back*The last shuttle leaves at 11:30. I would have loved to have stayed later. I so wanted to take a taxi back to the hotel. But, the band stopped around then, and while the thrill wasn't gone yet, I feared it might soon be. Too much of a good thing, might just be a bad thing.*In Conclusion*Your results may vary, for I surely must have stumbled upon some rare astrological occasion when all the planets and their moons aligned such that if you were to connect them, such connection would spell ""Daniel, the universe loves you. Big Time."". But, I have never in all my travels been to a place which made me feel so at home (thanks the personable, friendly service of Kindle), and so poignantly home sick (thanks to the immersive talent of The Stacy Mitchart Band).My only regret, is that I forgot to redeem my receipt for my souvenier glass.

"358 White Bridge PikeNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"Coming from Southern California, where Mexican food is a staple, I'm always on the hunt for really good Mexican spots. Since moving to TN, I have yet to find one that is actually any good - this place is no exception.The sign says ""Authentic Mexican Food"", but it's just the same  run-of-the-mill Southern imitation Mexican food that every other place serves. Just because a place serves tacos, burritos, enchiladas, and tamales doesn't automatically make it ""authentic Mexican"", it's about how those foods are prepared that make it authentic.Before sounding too negative, I'd like to say that the server was very friendly and did an overall good job. Also, the place was pretty clean and the chips and salsa were good and spicy.Having said that, I ordered a combo plate with a tamale, burrito, and enchilada so I could get a flavor for what they might do best (and I was feeling pretty indecisive). The plate showed up and looked just like any other typical presentation. When I tried each individual item, I noticed that it was very bland and had the texture of anything you would order at Taco Bell. The tamale was soggy and mushy and the beef inside didn't have much seasoning, the burrito was basically just ground beef, lettuce, some cheese, and a bunch of sour cream, and the enchilada, being probably the best thing by comparison, was just OK (probably because it was smothered with sauce to mask any kind of actual flavor). I forced myself to take a couple bites to give it a real chance, but I just was not satisfied at all so I asked the waiter to take it back. At that point, I just picked off my wife's plate of tacos and a side of guacamole. The tacos were just some cheap chicken, cheese, and lettuce (we had to ask for cilantro and corn tortillas instead of flour). The guacamole tasted fake and was probably from a huge tub of pre-made stuff that just gets slopped onto plates as they go out. Like I said, just your run-of-the-mill Mexican joint in the South catering to what's palatable to the greater population instead of bringing some actual culture and new flavors to the area. After finishing up, I looked over my check and saw that my plate that I sent back was still on it, so I asked the waiter and he said they would remove it up front at the register when I pay. I went up to pay and told the cashier about removing the plate and he said that he was going to charge me half-price since it looked like half the plate was eaten and because he ""hadn't heard any other complaints about their food"". That was ridiculous to me and I didn't even try to argue because, having worked on the other side of that situation as a waiter for 3 years, I was appalled and didn't want to lose my composure. That's just not good customer service and it shows a blatant disregard for your clients' opinion, satisfaction, and overall experience.  All in all, I don't give this place any credit as an ""authentic Mexican place"", a good restaurant, or even a decent Americanized Mexican place (because those do exist).

I really hate leaving bad reviews, but SERIOUSLY guys, what is going on?? We were seated right away in a half full room where every table had multiple screaming kids. It felt more like a Chucky Cheese (my nightmare) than a stress-free night out. Waiter peppers us with questions before we even sit down. My partner and I try to discuss our orders but end up yelling over all the noise. We contemplate asking to move but we are both really non confrontational and don't want to make a scene. We eventually order cheese dip to start and our entrees. Everything comes pretty quickly and the dip and salsa are decent. For the price, its actually pretty good. After we get our plates, his quesadilla doesn't come with any peppers and he mentions how he likes the quesadillas I make much better. My order is wrong and I try to flag down the waiter but he's disappeared by then...for awhile. I ordered shrimp as a special treat for myself but got chicken instead. Disappointed, but I wasn't opposed to it so I ate it anyway. It was okay - it was basically a ton of chicken fried in a tortilla shell (chimichanga). It was a little greasy and the chicken was a little dry without any other filling, like peppers and onions, etc. so I just poured our leftover cheese sauce on it. Waiter comes back about halfway through and apologizes and asks if its okay if I just keep it and he'll comp me the difference in price. He looks flustered, and I've been in that position as a former server so whatever. Apparently the table behind us also got a couple wrong orders, but they had a different server. Towards the end of the meal he brings me a dollar...um, okay. We wait awhile for the check and he finally comes back and we pay and leave - kids are still screaming in the background. I felt bad for the other couples in there.Pros (kind of) - Its your run of the mill cheap Mexisorta food (which I generally really like)Cons - Screaming kids, spotty service, run of the mill cheap Mexisorta food (not at all authentic)Its nothing special.

I've long despised going out for dinner ON my actual birthday because of how crowded the restaurants are, so we usually go out on another night. My husband says it bums him out that he can't take me out on my birthday, so he compromised by making early reservations so (hopefully) we wouldn't have to wait. Once we found the restaurant (it's oddly situated next to the Men's Shoes and looks more like an extension of the Men's Department from the outside than it does a restaurant), we were seated immediately. The place did fill up before we left, but I believe that there were some seating still available. I had heard that Nordstrom's had a restaurant but didn't know much about it. I was pleasantly surprised in the atmosphere and menu options. I actually had a difficult time deciding what to order. Both fortunately and unfortunately for me, I chose one of the weekly specials that's not on the regular menu and not even one of the daily options that they offer. I had the Boursin Chicken Ciabatta. This was fortunate for me because it was SPECTACULAR! It was an explosion of wonderful flavor combinations and was perfectly made that it didn't slide out the sides when I took the first bite or any subsequent bites. My choice was unfortunate because I will now crave this sandwich and want to go back for more but won't be guaranteed it will be on the menu. Maybe they'll make it upon order if I ask? I'll have to find out. The sandwich came with a choice of side, and I made the very easy decision of the Sweet Potato Fries that came with a wonderful Cilantro Lime Dipping Sauce that was simply amazing.

"2130 Abbott Martin RdNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"First off, If you're new to Nashville like I am, don't look for ""Sixth and Pine"" on Google Maps until this restaurant establishes itself. From what I can tell, Sixth and Pine seems to be the name of many of Nordstrom's restaurants located within their stores. I was treated to this place and was initially skeptical of eating at an establishment located at the back of the men's department. Granted, this is a Nordstrom's, so it's not as if the place was going to be cheap or tacky.I was very pleasantly surprised.First off, it was *packed* at lunch. Given the many big chain restaurants in this area, I was confused as to why people would come here, especially on a weekday.  We were given those ubiquitous devices that buzz you when your table is ready, while you continue to shop. We were told it was going to be 30-minute wait. Thankfully, someone in our small party of 3 knew someone at this restaurant. We were seated within minutes.The daily specials menu consists of a lot of comfort food. Meatloaf. Fried chicken.The complimentary starter were pickled carrots and cauliflower. It was a nice touch, but we didn't finish it.None of us had the dailies, but we opted for the salads and the cold and hot sandwiches. Being from California, it was strictly a coincidence that I had the California chicken salad. What can I say? I happen to like fruit in my salad. Butter lettuce was topped with a chicken salad made with currants. And there was a cluster of grapes in addition to the ones already in the salad. Very delicious and satisfying. I was worried that my salad was going to be huge as some of the other diners' plates that passed by us seemed to be. I had nothing to worry about.I also had the garlic fries with aioli. I didn't allow my tablemates to leave until I ate all of that.They had sandwiches and pasta. One person loved the way tea was presented to her; she could not stop raving about her chai. (I think they use Mighty Leaf Tea here.)Service was top notch, friendly, and professional. But it could also be that the server knew that his coworker's mom (who was eating there for the first time) was in our party.

The Hostess was friendly and offered us drinks while we waited. Once seated is where the good service ended. Our waiter was nice overall and tried his hardest and even offered selections that were the restaurants best sellers. We started with the ale battered onion rings with the cocktail sauce. The onion ring batter really needed salt but overall was not bad. The paring with the cocktail sauce was a little off putting flavor wise but was pretty good. Overall we would give them a 3 out of 5. Our entrees were the French Dip Sandwich with the fries accompanied by a horseradish aioli (a la cart) and I had the roasted chicken with carrots, asparagus, and mashed potatoes. My partner loved the sandwich, we had to send the fries back (which we rarely ever send food back)  as they were barely warm. When they came back hot, they were ok flavor wise but still missed something. The roasted chicken had a very crispy skin but had a sauce that was bland and completely underwhelming. The mashed potatoes clearly had alot of butter which is good and had a really smooth consistency. The carrots and asparagus were good but still lacked salt. Now I know that is the 3rd time that I have spoken about salt on a dish. I am a pepper person by nature and never put extra seasoning on food because I figure the chef has a reason why they combine the flavors the way they do, but a lack of salt on any dish is such a major error that it is almost unforgivable.

"250 5th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Last night we went to the Art Crawl downtown, so we were trying to find a spot for dinner in walking distance of the galleries and Barlines made the cut. I really liked the setup of the restaurant, which included a full bar, an outdoor patio, a stage, and TVS, including one HUGE TV above the stage. It felt like an upscale sports bar with a southern twist. My favorite part of the restaurant was the outdoor patio, and since it was a nice night they had opened the tall glass garage doors so that the restaurant became open-aired. As for my meal, it was okay. I got the Moonshine cheeseburger with a fried egg and braised onions with a side of BBQ chips, which were the blandest chips I've ever had. Should have gone with the fries. The burger was okay, but I blame Nashville's burger establishments (Pharmacy, Gabby's, Burger UP) for making my burger standards very high.The drinks were definitely the best part of the meal.

So Loveless Cafe is surrounded by a handful of little Loveless shops that well a variety of items such as jams, preserves, bacon, trinkets, tourist souvenirs and clothing. I bought a rather awesome ""Taking Care of Biscuits"" t shirt but one wash turned the large into a Small, so I actually never got to wear it. I'll frame it and hang it on the wall or something. We perused the shops and enjoyed looking at their paintings and souvenirs (mini mason jars are just the darnedest cutest things) and my friend bought a canvas painting of a rather happy looking pig. We named him Wilbur Darnell. Don't ask. But the food. Ohhhhhhh man the food. So the policy is that as long as you stay on the first round (it's all you can eat), you're allowed to take the leftovers home. But once you order seconds of Anything, you are not allowed to take anything from the table home. Luckily, we never even made it out of the first round. Just look at my photo. Hilariously huge spread.But I want to talk about the biscuits. These biscuits make you question your life, the world, the Galaxy and Mother Nature herself. You question religion and the science behind it. You question your upbringing and the girl you decided was worthy of your first kiss. That's how magical these biscuits are. Small, fluffy, chewy, yet airy and buttery (you must butter it--it's phenomenal), these are worth the hype and the rave reviews. Served with four preserves (the blackberry was my personal favorite), you must always order more. The fried chicken. Best. Skillet. Fried. Chicken. Ever. Skillet fried chicken is something every single one of you (even you strange vegan and vegetarian folk) need to try at least once in your life because you will be shocked at just how different it is from regular deep fried. Juicy while maintaining the crisp skin, Loveless has it going on. The pulled pork with corn cakes. Okay the portion was absurd. We each had two helpings and it looked as if a family of six could've enjoyed it afterwards. Needless to say we took it home and enjoyed some delicious leftovers.  Man was the pork great. Tender, sweet and tangy, with a hint of smoke, it was a favorite of ours. The fried okra was delicious (god I love fried okra), but it could've used a pinch of salt after frying as it was a bit bland. Fried green tomatoes. Best I had the entire week.Mashed potatoes were excellent as was the gravy that accompanied them. I can't stop thinking about the biscuits. I haven't stopped since I left the place.

I'll start by saying that for me, the best part was the experience: the gift shops, decor, and southern hospitality from the staff. When we put our name on the list, we were told it would be a 1 hour and 45 minute wait. There are plenty of gift shops to spend money at while you wait on your buzzer to go off. It ended up being about an hour wait. I spent $30 on a ceramic berry carton, a tea towel, and foot cream. All very cute and I use them regularly so I don't regret any of them. As far as the food goes, (don't judge me, we hadn't eaten anything and my eyes are larger than my stomach) I ordered two eggs sunny side up, a fried green tomato and pimento cheese biscuit, home fried potatoes, a piece of fried catfish, & biscuits and white gravy. My husband ordered a few of the same things, but also pancakes. The good: the pancakes were huge and good. The biscuits and homemade jams were tasty. Not drive 30 mins out of my way good, but definitely the best thing I had. The catfish was tasty and I wish I had ordered the catfish supper plate. The bad: the eggs whites weren't completely cooked. I know a little is expected on sunny side up eggs, but I scraped more than I'd like to the side of my plate. The gravy was... weird. My mother-in-law also ordered the white gravy and we both thought there was something about it that was off. I had a couple bites wanting to like it and just couldn't eat it. It didn't taste old or like it had gone bad. It just had a really different flavor than anything I've ever tasted in white gravy. The meh: fried green tomato and pimento cheese biscuit. This was a 60:30:10 pimento cheese:biscuit:tomato ratio so I really only tasted the pimento cheese, which was nowhere near as good as my own homemade pimento cheese. The home fries were cut up in little squares and deep fried, probably frozen, potatoes. Similar home fries are available at Nashville biscuit house down the road from our house. I guess what I'm saying is that we won't go literally out of our way anytime soon to go back, but if we have friends visit who want to go, we will go back with them and I will try the catfish plate.

The Loveless Cafe was my first stop on a trip to severe heatburn that was worth every painstaking moment and choked down Tums.So let's start with the biscuit. Warm buttery and flaky as any good biscuit should be.  To accompany it, I also ordered the fried catfish, okra and sweet potatoes, along with a bloody mary made with the cafe's own bloody mary mix. I have to say it was the spiciest bloody mary I have ever had. My husband had an iced tea drink with moonshine that came with its own, little moonshine glass you could take home. Very cute.But what the Loveless Cafe is known for is their banana pudding. Now by this point, after eating all of the above, I had no room for it. But we ordered some to take back to the hotel, and having never had banana pudding before, I have nothing to compare it to, but it was delicious with chunks of real banana in it. Overall, I was incredibly stuffed and pleased, and the only reason I am not giving this five stars was because I'm not sure it was entirely worth it.Yes, the food was good.

I have a corner grocery afghani place near home that makes infinitely better chicken for $1 a piece. the hash casserole and catfish came out cold and had to be reheated... the casserole was good but you can put that much cheese, butter and heavy cream on paper and it will taste good too. the fried gizzards and liver... were awesome.

She refilled my husband's water; he was sitting right next to me, but I just had to be thirsty.   She didn't inquire if anyone wanted anything.  All she asked was if we were finished with our plates so she could clear them.The food:  Seriously?  Is this the famous Loveless Cafe food??  We were served family style.  Nine people at our table were given serving dishes that would have maybe fed four people (see the above note about the server not asking if anyone wanted anything else).  On the Loveless catering link, it says ""All You Can Eat"" on the page that describes the family style menu options.  All a 3 year old can eat would be more accurate.  We left hungry.  Our event chose the Fairview Family Style catering option, $35/person.Our menu consisted of:Chef's seasonal salad--typical salad.  I didn't eat mine.  It had gorgonzola cheese and fresh apple chunks.  At the time, I wasn't sure what kind of cheese it was, just white and crumbled; I assumed either bleu or feta.  I don't like any of the soft cheeses like that, and I'm allergic to apples, so no salad course for me.  Husband said it was alright, and the pralines were very good.Macaroni and cheese--it was cold.  It tasted like elbow noodles with melted Velvetta.  Stouffer's frozen mac and cheese has better flavor.Green Beans and Carrots-- I don't like green beans or carrots, so I have not idea if they tasted good.  My husband ate them. He said they were cold.Fried Chicken--it was almost cold, barely warm.  The flavor was good, but these were some of the most scrawny pieces of chicken I have ever seen.  Our dish of chicken had more wings than anything.  At least 2 people at our table were stuck with one chicken wing as their entree.  I have no idea what part of the chicken I ate; the piece was too small to identify.Biscuits--If these are the famous Loveless Biscuits, then someone did a tremendous PR job.  The biscuits were about 1 1/2 inches square, flat, dense, chewy and COLD.  Not light, fluffy, tender and hot from the oven like biscuits are supposed to be.Dessert--Banana Pudding.  I can't review the quality.  Of the nine people at my table, I and one other skipped dessert altogether because we don't like banana pudding.  One girl had never eaten it before and tried it.  She didn't like it either.  Another lady knew banana pudding wasn't her favorite but ate a small spoonful out of politeness.  Hubby isn't a big banana pudding fan either.  Please, just because we're in the south, and banana pudding is the signature southern dessert, do your guests a favor and pick something else for the dessert course, preferably chocolate.  Loveless doesn't have a chocolate dessert option, which is ridiculous.  Overall, Loveless Catering was absolutely not worth the price.  Rental prices for the Barn facility seemed reasonable judging form information on the website.",Loveless Cafe,6156469700.0,13.0,2015-10-08,"Nolensville, TN",/biz/loveless-cafe-nashville,1.0,973,"Nashville, TN",Andrea B.,36.1622296,-86.774353,35.9522852,-86.66944129999996,15.62133830569326,True,3330.0

Some relatives from Cali came in to visit so we stopped here after picking them up for the airport. We arrived there at a time that most restaurants aren't that busy; smack dab between lunch and dinner. However it was still an hour wait here, and I'm actually shocked it was *only* an hour given how many people were there. I really liked the building(s) itself. For anyone who doesn't know, the Loveless Cafe and surrounding shops are a converted motel from the 50's. I love places like this; you can tell just by looking at it that it's a relic from the golden age of highway road trips. You almost never see such things anymore, as they've either been torn down or are in complete disrepair because they went out of business after the interstate system was built. The little shops were cool. Touristy but charming. They had quite a few interesting items, as well as some food such as jams and cured meats. I had plenty of time to check them out while waiting on my table.Once we were finally seated, I was quite impressed by the service. Despite being packed to capacity, our server was extremely attentive and very sweet, taking plenty of time to explain the specials and whatnot. I ordered their blue plate special for the day, ""Honeyspice"" chicken or something to that effect. It was a half chicken barbecued with a spicy honey-based sauce. It was absolutely fantastic, as were the turnip greens and okra that accompanied it. The biscuits, for which this place is apparently known, were quite good as well. My girlfriend and I shared a slice of fudge pie for dessert and it was quite delicious. All in all it was a really fun experience, but the wait is long enough that this isn't the sort of place I'd want to go to regularly.

The other intriguing thing on their menu is their family style supper for groups of 4 or more.  It's all you can eat for $17.55 a person.  The table has to agree upon two meats and three veggies.  It also includes a regular drink.  It is so good that it would be worth a three hour drive.  Seriously.",Loveless Cafe,6156469700.0,432.0,2014-05-27,"Memphis, TN",/biz/loveless-cafe-nashville,5.0,973,"Nashville, TN",Andy S.,36.1622296,-86.774353,35.1490215,-90.0516285,197.17803677714622,False,2644.0

So obviously, because Loveless Cafe was marketing their own hot sauce, I was quick to write it off. How wrong I was. This hot sauce is AMAZING. It's spicy without being overwhelming and adds a unique flavor to any dish without overpowering the original. I was such a fan that I bought a bottle for myself and my family.

We decided to travel to Nashville just for the hell of it and because it was cold in Chicago. Next to the sunshine and warm temperature, Loveless was the biggest selling point for us to come on down.We knew what to expect in coming to Loveless. We knew it would be packed and we would have to wait, but did we care? Absolutely not. Good food is worth waiting for, especially when it's on every major list of things you need to see in Nashville. We called ahead which I highly recommend. Once we finally arrived, they were telling people an hour but they only quoted us 30 minutes since we had called and our name was already on the list. (By the time we were leaving they were telling people an hour and a half, so go as early as you can!) Although there's a few shops on the property, it's not enough to kill more than 20 minutes. Loveless is primarily known for the biscuits and they didn't disappoint. I especially loved the peach jam that came with it. I also ordered some sausage gravy for the biscuits, but that was a waste of money -- the free jam was the way to go!Breakfast was great, especially the jalapeno bacon. It wasn't too spicy, but the jalapeno gave it a nice flavor. Also, whoever said their hashbrown casserole was better than Cracker Barrel's wasn't lying. I kept eyeing my husband's hoping he wouldn't eat it. I should have just stole it from him :(Our waiter was so welcoming that it almost made me wish I lived in Nashville so I could hang out with him. When he saw my ID (carded me for my mimosas) and saw that it was an IL license he recommended his favorite places in Nashville for us.

All the jams were fantastic and worked really well with the biscuits (they sell them in their gift shop and at the airport). The fried chicken was perfect and very juicy and our sides (mac and cheese, fried green tomatoes, sweet potatoes, and mashed potatoes) were top-notch. Our waitress even brought over some carrot pudding for us to try for free since she wanted us to like it, which was really nice (and tasty!).

The pork is so juicy and flavorful, and there was just a hint of BBQ sauce, so the smoky flavor carried the omelet. It was perfect. 5 stars.

"8400 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37221",4.0,"There's a lot of good things going at Loveless Cafe, to start, let's do a list:1. Southern hospitality. We asked our server what's sorghum and without explaining she went ahead and brought 2 containers of plain sorghum and then a bowl of butter and sorghum and mixed it on the table to show us how it should be eaten. Try it if you like molasses or just try it for the sake of trying. Always courteous, shows up at the right time, and splitting checks - no problem. 2. History and photos.3. Kitsch and charm.4. Overall good showcase of southern food: my picks were the butter and fruit jams, biscuits, fried chicken, creamed corn, hashbrown casserole, and slaw.Country ham (as warned by our server) is VERY salty and a bit tough. Something that I thought would be amazing would be the Banana Pudding was just ok, not much vanilla wafers. Pulled pork was said to be smoked for over 12hrs gave me too much of a high expectation. Fried chicken was good, moist and lightly battered.  Food was on the salty and sweet side. The souvenoir shops always leave a slightly bad impression. It's a double edge sword.

"8400 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37221",4.0,"Came to the loveless this past weekend.  I have mixed feelings on this place.  First, the good.  The food was good.  I've had better but this is certainly better than average food.  The biscuits they bring out first are really good and the preserves were good as well.  I had the Half-Fried chicken.  The breading was very good however, the meat was a little on the dry side.  Good flavor just not as moist as I like my fried chicken.  The slow cooked green beans were good and my favorite part of the meal was the hash brown casserole.  The staff was very friendly.  The bad, this is Tennessee and the Sweet tea left a lot to be desired.  I've had better Sweet tea at McDonalds.  The wait, yes I know the wait is long most days at this place.  I don't mind waiting but the shops just weren't much to look at and after about 15 minutes we had pretty much seen everything.  They had some corn hole games around but couldn't find and bean bags to play.  The snacks in the shops are way overprices.  My advice, if you need a little snack to hold you over while you wait for 2 or more hours, there is a Shell station next door.  Pick up a small back of pretzels for $1.  Overall, probably a 3.5 stars in my book.  i would certainly recommend going for the experience and the friendly staff.  Expect the long wait and just be prepared.",Loveless Cafe,6156469700.0,123.0,2013-10-20,"Carmel, IN",/biz/loveless-cafe-nashville,3.0,973,"Nashville, TN",Dave C.,36.1622296,-86.774353,39.978371100000004,-86.1180435,265.621689679076,False,1351.0

The biscuits (6) came with the breakfast meal I ordered. They came with 3 different types of jams (strawberry, peach, and blueberry). After having the blackberry jam at Urban Grub, any other jam seems average to me. Initially I ordered the Breakfast Steak and 2 Eggs but they ran out of the Rib-eye (at 8:00 am!! boooo!!!), so I changed to Pit-Cooked Pork BBQ and Eggs instead. I had my eggs fried - medium and a side of hash-brown casserole. I wasn't a fan of the BBQ, however my friend loved it alot and ended up eating most of it. I never touched the hash-brown because of how cheesy it was. My fault, I should had gotten the potatoes instead. The only thing I like in this dish is the eggs, they were cooked to perfection.My friend had the Southern Sampler Breakfast (Country Ham, Sausages, Bacon, and Red-eye gravy.

It was in the low 40's outside and we were able to wait inside right across from the pie cabinet. People watching is quite good from here and it amazed us how many guests place themselves direct in the single doorway after checking in, making it terrible for those leaving or entering. Not Loveless' fault but certainly a fire hazard and rude.Once seated at a clean and well set four top table in the largest dining room on the East side of the building, our delightful and knowledgeable waitress greeted us and took our drink order. I want to reiterate a point I made in my previous review that the wait staff at Loveless is the absolute best you will find at any Nashville restaurant. Certainly a reason to eat here!Very quickly our drinks arrived along with the biggest plate of hot biscuits, three flavors of preserves and plenty of real butter we remember receiving in many years. Our Waitress took our food order and we chatted briefly. Today we learned that Tom Morales and TomKats Catering no longer has any involvement with Loveless. I noticed a Senior Manager that appeared very professional and maintaining a regular, close review of the wait list. Bravo!!! The lady that seems to always be handling the wait list when we visit Loveless is the weakest link at Loveless so I was thrilled to see a General Manager regularly overseeing her work, asking questions and staying very familiar with the info on the list. Please keep doing this Management!Now to the food. Chocolate chip pancakes that my daughter always orders were perfect and so large she brought some leftovers home. The breakfast steak and eggs my wife ordered were served hot and cooked to order. The steak could be a better grade meat and actually a bit smaller. My guess is the steaks are coming at average grade from a Sysco type supplier and a local area grain fed beef supplier would be a nice improvement for Loveless to consider and make a highlight of the menu. Today I ordered the half-order country ham meal with red-eye gravy, eggs & grits. All cooked just right, served hot and plated perfectly. I got chocolate milk for my drink, a first, and was very pleased that it came in a carton from our local (sadly now owned by Dean) Purity Dairy. This is the same milk I grew up drinking in Nashville from weekly home delivery 50 years ago and it is still the best anywhere! Great choice for your dairy products Loveless. I still want to encourage first time visitors to ask for seating in the original small dining room to the left of the hostess stand.

"8400 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37221",4.0,"""Breakfast at The Loveless Café?""I had been in Nashville less than 24 hours, and this was the third time I had heard of/and been instructed to eat at The Loveless Café. So, we did!Since the 1940's, Lon and Annie Loveless have been serving chicken and biscuits right from the front door of their house to travelers going to and from Nashville. Eventually, their 'home' became a regularly scheduled stop of travelers, and as such evolved into The Loveless Motel and Café in 1951.Today, they serve 7000 biscuits a day, and once you've sunk your teeth into the creamy, buttery goodness, you'll know why. They are amazing. They also bring an assortment of fresh made preserves to the table. Yum.I watch a lot of cooking shows, which is ironic, since I don't cook. Our stove is used to store things, suitcases waiting to be used and shoes waiting to be worn. However, from the myriad of cooking shows, I have gleaned that Tennesseans know bar-b-queue, and after visiting, I am convinced.  Ribs, ribs and more ribs. Ribs slow cooked in a pit. Ribs smoked dry, baked, boiled, broiled, rubbed, doused, simmered and oh so good. The Rib Special of the day at The Loveless, were slow cooked with watermelon; the meat literally falling from the bone. The keys to good ribs, I'm told, are some 'fine swine' and lots of time.Throughout the ages, The Loveless Café has been a much cherished piece of Nashville culture. In 2004, for the first time in Loveless history, they closed their doors for renovation. When they reopened a few months later, 'folks were standing in line thicker than sausage gravy'.Today The Loveless has been featured on many shows, including Ellen DeGeneres, Today and Good Morning America.

Our excellent waiter brought us a basket of steaming, golden-white puffs (ah, those biscuits), pots of jewel-bright, fruity-fruity strawberry, peach, and blackberry preserves (we finished them off with a spoon), plus the sorghum we'd requested. I suspect Annie Loveless developed her biscuits with sorghum in mind--their pairing beats all I've had in the south. A couple unique items on Loveless Cafe's beverage menu are its moonshine offerings. The watermelon moonshine comes in 2 mason jars, a large one, pink with watermelon juice and chunks, and a mini-jar with an ounce of clear moonshine. Poured together, they produce a refreshing drink, no cloying sweetness.Our orders of watermelon ribs and fried chicken both came with 2 sides, so we ended up with creamed corn (double), macaroni and cheese, and the pot liquor greens. It's good we didn't have to share our sides of the creamed corn--wow, it's light and lovely and (woot, woot!) the recipe is available online. The watermelon ribs are dry-rubbed and smoked, then braised with the nicely tangy sauce and watermelon chunks, a process that gives the chunks a great tomatoey taste and texture. The fried chicken, though, proved why the Loveless Cafe has such an enduring reputation. Make sure at least one person in your party orders it, and make sure he or she shares!And save  room for dessert.

I went with orange juice and it was delicious.  I know this place gets hyped up a lot, but it does not disappoint.  Just remember to call ahead and be prepared to wait anyway.  As long as you aren't an impatient pants and don't mind making a morning/afternoon of the trip, it's definitely worth it.",Loveless Cafe,6156469700.0,188.0,2012-01-16,"Nashville, TN",/biz/loveless-cafe-nashville,5.0,973,"Nashville, TN",Lisa B.,36.1622296,-86.774353,36.1622296,-86.774353,0.0,True,2413.0

You'll be glad for the distractions when you're told to wait an hour (or more) for a table. (Don't worry, the beepers they give you cover the entire grounds.) By the way, since we were eating here on the 4th of July, we were told that the wait wasn't that bad for a weekend.Oy.Nevertheless, we were in full tourist mode and the waiting seemed par for the course. But what were we waiting for? Well, based on our orders, a ham steak with red eye gravy breakfast plate and a Bacon, Lettuce and Fried Green Tomatoes sandwich.  I honestly wished I could have tried some of the other dishes, but we'd had a huge breakfast and had to order small. (OK, RELATIVELY small.) My BLT was great. The fried green tomato was thick, the outer coating (corn meal) crispy. A few (hipster) places here in ATL also serve this same dish, but the Loveless version beats them by an, ahem, country mile. My greens were tasty, but I prefer mine a little more spicy and a little less sweet. I guess that's what the pepper sauce is for.My wife selected the ham steak. Being gluten-free, she wasn't able to pick from much more of the menu nor was she able to enjoy the biscuits. Nevertheless, the ham steak was thick cut and as salty as you'd expect. The wife, a big coffee fan, ordered the redeye gravy and was alternated pleased and repulsed by it. As a NON-coffee fan, I was just repulsed, but that's just redeye gravy in general and not Loveless' serving.And to the biscuits....as a biscuit connoisseur I can definitely tell you these aren't drop biscuits. The wife's granny, an old southern lady who I think was around during the War of Northern Aggression, taught the wife how to make drop biscuits, so that's her frame of reference. I, on the other hand, am more familiar with the flaky, layered kind and these were THAT version. That said, I love Loveless' biscuits. My wife, gluten-free though she may be, cheated a little and had a nibble. She declared them good (even better with sorghum preserves on them), but not as good as granny's. I've got to disagree.

There was a 25 minute wait, but since it's the Loveless and it's Saturday night (and it was gorgeous out), that was no problem...we just explored the property.There's a little shop off to the side that sells ham, bacon, preserves, biscuit mix and various Nashville paraphenalia like you would find if you were getting off the airport. Yeah, it's tourist central, but who really cares - there's a fridge full of bacon. Seriously. Bacon. Fridge. Want. (My sister and I were unsuccessful at convincing my mom to get a ""I'm Not Bashful I'm From Nashville"" sticker for her car).So we moseyed around (because that's what we natives do when we're not line dancing, going to Tootsies and wearing our boots and hats, right? We mosey) and found a nice big porch outside Trace Bikes (which is in one of the shops in the old converted Motel - the Motel portion of the Loveless has been converted into a hipster strip mall) and enjoyed the sun while we waited for the pager to go off.When we went inside...we walked past the screen door that used to be the entrance (and was the last time I was there) and went right...last time I went left.After reviewing the menu (and determining that I wanted breakfast for dinner and you can't convince me otherwise), I got a barbecue pork omelette, thinking a) I like both of those things and b) where else am I going to get that. They brought our biscuits and preserves to the table (if in doubt, use the peach), we fell into a biscuit coma and our food came.While I never ever would have considered putting barbecue into an omelette...it was fantastic (and gigantic)...I'd get it again if there weren't so much more deliciousness waiting for me on the menu in future visits.Because we had determined that we had already gone all-in with this dinner, we ordered dessert.

Large chunks of fruit in the peach and strawberry jams. Richard ordered the Country ham and Eggs with homemade creamed corn and mashed potatoes. The country ham was just salty enough to call it country ham, but not so salty that you are puckering afterwards. I ordered the country fried steak with mashed potatoes and candied yams. Both orders were served with white and brown gravy. Their brown gravy was the best I have had. Nothing was even remotely even OK, but absolutely wonderful good ol' fashioned suthern cookin'!!!

"8400 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37221",4.0,"I'm not one of those people who gets up early to eat breakfast or that person who just can't get started for the day without a heaping plate of sausage and eggs first thing after I wake up. Hell, most days, by the time I've done my morning routine (check emails, read the latest Cracked articles, read the news, shower/dress), it makes more sense to eat an early lunch and just skip breakfast (unhealthy, I know). This is not to say that I don't enjoy breakfast. I loved chowing down on the dining hall's breakfast on weekends when I was in college. I'm always up for a late night trip to IHOP (or WAHO, if I'm south of the Mason-Dixon). I've even been known to whip up big Sunday breakfasts if the mood suits me (homemade pancakes are my go-to, but I've made crepes and ebelskivers and omelets and more). I'm not a fan of early morning breakfasts, but I adore brunch and I enjoy leisurely breakfasts, and when I'm traveling, I'm much more inclined to fit breakfast into my schedule.While visiting Nashville a few weeks ago with my best friend from home, trying out breakfast joints was near the top of our list of things to do. The South knows how to do breakfast and Nashville has a collection of well known breakfast places and diners (including Noshville and Pancake Pantry). The Loveless Cafe is perhaps the best known breakfast place and it's famous for a reason: they serve a delicious breakfast. To be completely honest, we didn't actually dine in the restaurant...we drove out there on a Saturday (after being defeated by the long lines at the Pancake Pantry) with high hopes of finding a seat. Unfortunately, everyone and their mother had the same thought in mind, so when we pulled in, it was a struggle just to find a parking spot, let alone a spot on the restaurant's waiting list. After hearing the wait could be well over an hour, and unable to handle the increasing grumbles of distress from our stomachs, we opted for the take-out option (having been reassured that it would only take about 15 minutes). 30 minutes later (which was not too bad, because the waiting list time was now almost 2 hours), we had two Styrofoam containers filled with breakfast and, as the weather was unusually warm for January, we were able to to take a seat at one of the picnic tables in front of the restaurant. The food was delicious: the eggs were light and fluffy, the biscuits were airy and buttery, the sausage had a nice snap to it, and the jam was sweet. My friend had some sort of concoction of pulled pork and eggs and hash browns and more and enjoyed every forkful. After dining, we roamed around the property, visiting the little shops scattered about (I happily purchased a bag of biscuit mix and apple butter--both ended up being delicious). So, while I can't review the actual dining experience in the restaurant, I can say that the food was excellent and, with its reputation and that whole ""the owner was friends with Paula Deen and a bunch of country stars have eaten there"" thing, it makes sense that it's a busy little place. If you want to dine in, be prepared to wait for a long time. Take-out is a great option and it definitely is quicker than waiting for a table--there are picnic benches around the property, or you could always take it to go. The employees I spoke to were incredibly friendly, despite the craziness going on around them, and they were quick too. The restaurant is a little bit out of the way, but parking is pretty decent and it's not too far from downtown. If you're looking for a great breakfast, definitely drop by...just be prepared for the fact that you may just end up eating breakfast for lunch due to the wait time.",Loveless Cafe,6156469700.0,32.0,2013-02-12,"Memphis, TN",/biz/loveless-cafe-nashville,3.0,973,"Nashville, TN",Sarah S.,36.1622296,-86.774353,35.1490215,-90.0516285,197.17803677714622,False,3664.0

I ate 4 at my meal (and this is coming from someone who does not like biscuits). Also, 5 stars for the preserves (especially the blackberry and peach) and the honey and molasses.The fried chicken was also solid, as were the sides.

The jams and butter on the were good.The so/so: grits, nothing special, but they were cheese grits, but didn't notice any cheesiness. The ham, decent, but whatever flavor.The bad: Red eye tasted like an old, bad cup of coffee. It's suppose to be 80 gravy/ham flavor/juices, and 20 coffee. Just enough to not notice it for anything but richness.The ugly: medium fried eggs is what I ordered, what I got 3 times in a roll was over easy. They were so easy that when I transferred them to my saucer as instructed by the waitress, they busted and ran all in my plate.  She walked away and I used my only napkin and spouses to sop up the mess to attempt and save my ham.

Loveless doesn't take reservations, but if you call and say you're on your way they will put your name down for you. It could shave an hour off a really long wait. Yeah, I know it's annoying, but they must be doing something right if they can attract crowds like they do.Rule #2: Order right. There is only one thing as far as I am concerned. Fried. Chicken.

"8400 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37221",4.0,"After seeing this place featured on The Food Network awhile ago, I've had a desire to go to Nashville and experience the famed Loveless Cafe biscuits and jam for myself. I had the opportunity last week during a spring break trip to Tennessee, and I was not disappointed.The biscuits. Sweet Jesus, the BISCUITS. Light, fluffy, yet firm and chewy. How do they do it? No one but the owners know, apparently. It's like they took the traditional southern biscuit and gave it to the Buddha, who took it to Nirvana and then brought it back to share with the unenlightened. Seriously, I cannot express in words how impressively delicious these biscuits are. Their preserves are nothing to sneeze at either, especially their blackberry preserves, which were rich and had what tasted like a subtle note of cinnamon in it. Their strawberry preservers were also good, but I found the peach preserves to be kind of bland and too sweet, like they'd boiled down canned peaches to make it.I also ordered their meatloaf, fried okra, and greens while my friend ordered the southern fried catfish, sweet potatoes, and fried okra. The meatloaf was moist and excellently seasoned with a tangy tomato sauce on top. The greens were also good, but I got a lot of little crunchies in there with them which lead me to believe that they hadn't rinsed them very well. Their fried okra was crunchy, which is a feat since a lot of fried okra I've ordered at other places has been soggy. The bite of  fried catfish my friend allowed me to have personified southern tradition. She did say that her sweet potatoes were too sweet, though.In the end, all the food we had here was good, but the biscuits and preserves are definitely the stars of the show. I was so impressed by them that right after we got done eating I waddled over to the adjacent store and bought two jars of preserves and a bag of biscuit mix. I doubt it will be as good as the real thing, but even a shadow of the glory we experienced that night will make almost all other biscuits pale in comparison.",Loveless Cafe,6156469700.0,197.0,2009-03-28,"Austin, TX",/biz/loveless-cafe-nashville,4.0,973,"Nashville, TN",Mary T.,36.1622296,-86.774353,30.2711286,-97.7436995,753.2582991879427,False,2038.0

In fact, I would drive all the way here just for a taste of these light, fluffy, buttery morsels topped with the house's homemade blackberry jam. Coming from the Pacific Northwest, I know a good blackberry when I taste it - and them's some tasty berries! Biscuits come standard with the breakfast dishes, so if you're here for your morning meal you'll be starting your day off right.Breakfast consists of authentic versions of all your standard southern favorites: pancakes, eggs, grits, etc., plus a few house specialties like hash brown casserole (hash browns mixed with cheese and onions and held together with chicken soup), homemade gravy (if you're brave, try the red eye gravy: ham drippings mixed with black coffee!). I was expecting ginormous portions, but the servings were moderate, which for me is a good thing. The food was neither too heavy nor too greasy. This not only leaves more room for biscuits, but ensures you don't head back out into the muggy weather feeling like you have an anvil in your guts.The breakfast ham is cured on site, and carnivores looking for BBQ meat offerings need look no further than the smokehouse next door to the main restaurant. Speaking of things next door to the main restaurant, there are plenty of places to check out surrounding the café.

"8400 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37221",4.0,"So here I am several weeks after visiting Loveless Cafe writing a review. Giving 5 stars to restaurant doesn't happen often so I wanted to make sure my high from eating there had worn off. Well I can honestly say it is still there, and I can't wait until I can find my way back to Nashville to eat at this place again.  I have lived in the South my entire life and have been raised on a diet of fried chicken, pork products galore, veggies seasoned with meat products, and biscuits. It is always fun to scroll through reviews and see comments such as ""the tea was too sweet"", ""the ham was a bit too salty"", or ""the jams were too sweet"". Those statements shouldn't be uttered in the South unless you want to face a firing squad. I can honestly say this is some of the best food I have ever had in a restaurant setting. Lots of restaurants in the South advertise themselves as ""good Southern cooking"" but few can deliver like Loveless.Our cross country trip from San Diego along I-40 finally reached Nashville and after stopping to visit with some friends we were instructed that we had to visit Loveless Cafe. I liked the fact that this place was located away from the hustle and bustle of the city. We only had to wait around 30 minutes for a table on a Saturday night. I am annoyed at the people that have dinged this place for having to wait a long time. Good food = long waits. If you want a shorter wait then head into the city limits and find a Taco Bell. Loveless Cafe has a nice little business enterprise because while waiting for a table you are free to peruse their Hams and Jams Country Market. I had dropped 75 bucks there before even stepping in the restaurant. Their jams are excellent (strawberry and blueberry are must have). Their pumpkin butter is also very tasty. Make sure to grab a mail order brochure for their Hams and Jams because you will want more after leaving. The store is a little on the small side so expect to bump elbows with fellow customers.After being seated a friendly waitress quickly brought us a piping hot stack of biscuits with preserves. It seems the biscuits are always a highlight of every review. They aren't the best Southern biscuits I have ever had but they are very good. When mass producing biscuits some quality has to be sacrificed. Still the preserves are VERY good and if you haven't purchased some already you will after leaving the restaurant. Just pace yourself or you will be full before your entree comes to the table.  I had an order of the pit cooked pork barbecue which was tender and flavorful and topped with their homemade BBQ sauce (which can also be purchased). I tasted the sig-o's country fried steak which was equally tasty. I tasted the mashed potatoes, homemade creamed corn, slow cooked green beans, and hashbrown casserole. The cooks didn't hold back on the butter and meat seasoning. No room for dessert but I was ogling the blubbery cobbler at the table over. I can't wait to try their breakfast when I go back. Every single dish I tasted here was phenomenal.This place simply can't be missed if you are visiting Nashville.

The entire lot is kinda like it's own theme park for the Loveless Cafe. It's got its own market and some art and craft stores. It's cute. Not my style but it's cute. Waiting for a table, I decided to mozy around to the market store and there I finally understood that this was THE biscuit place. The one that won in that food network challenge vs. bobby flay. I'm not a bobby flay fan so I was super glad to know that this ""Biscuit Lady""  (that's what they call her apparently-- I prefer Goddess of Biscuits) triumphed over him in the biscuit challenge. With this piece of information, I was starting to understand my family's hype and got super excited. I already love biscuits but I'm from California where I feel like  there isn't many places that specialize in biscuits, so this was very exciting-- finally to eat biscuits that people who know good biscuits think are good biscuits. So finally we sit down at our table and out come these glorious pieces of heaven- hot and soft and flaky in just the right places. They were bites of wonderful. And damn, I love the preserves tooooo! The mountain of hot biscuits come with three different side jams-- strawberry, peach, and blackberry. I didn't care which one I had because the combination of biscuit and preserve? One cannot go wrong with any of it. Amazeballs! The only reason I don't give it five stars (Because the biscuits and preserves totally deserve 5 if not 6 stars) is that the breakfast I had was just okay. And the chicken fried steak (or country fried steak--forgot what it's called) was just .. meh. It was nothing special nor it do I think it was worth the prices. I had eggs and sausage and I was quite disappointed. The sausage was burnt and awkward tasting, and the home fries were crispy but just okay. Perhaps it was because of all the quality goodness that the biscuits gave me that the other foods were so bland. Still despite the mediocre food, I'd go back for the biscuits.

Their grilled chicken is apparently marinated for 36 hours, which makes a world of difference in the flavor and keeping it moist. The gyro meat was nice as well.

"6444 Nolensville PikeNashville, TN 37013",4.0,"I have dined in at Blu Fig twice and carried out twice. Each time, the experience has been outstanding. Let me lay out a typical visit for you...When you enter the restaurant, you'll be greeted by an enthusiastic and energetic staff. If you want to dine in, you'll be motioned to a table. Go up to the counter for carry out. You'll be presented with a menu full of Mediterranean treats: gyros, falafel, and hummus are just a few items. They also have delectable drinks: fruit smoothies, bubble tea, and their special fruit tea. I can attest to the bubble and fruit teas, which are made with fresh ingredients while you wait.The food might take a while to get out to you; keep in mind, this isn't really ""fast food."" Your meal is made AFTER you order it, so you know the food is fresh and hot. When your food is ready, a staff member will bring it out to you or get everything packed up nice and neat so you're ready to go. They'll check on you throughout your time there, making sure you are satisfied and have everything you need.Every item I've had at Blu Fig has been delicious. Here's a list of what I've tried:* Hummus with Pita Bread: The best restaurant hummus I've ever had. Seriously. It's extremely smooth and flavorful, served with a drizzle of olive oil and a couple of black olives in the center. * Gyro meat and chicken (in pita and as a platter): Very tender and tasty. The meats are pulled from a rotating vertical spit and sliced thin. In a gyro, the meat is placed on a bed of lettuce and tomatoes, topped with a tzatziki sauce. As a platter, it is served over saffron rice pilaf with side of pita bread and seasoned chips (extra thick and crispy!) or a salad. * Falafel (in pita and as a platter): Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I have had falafel elsewhere (in Chicago) that is softer than Blu Fig's on the inside, which I prefer, but Blu Fig's falafel has a good texture--not dry and not cakey. Their falafel isn't greasy either, so it seems healthier than some others. I would still like to try Blu Fig's baklava and other favors of bubble tea (I've only had the mango so far). Honestly, I would stop by here every couple of weeks if I had a chance--the food and the friendly atmosphere entice me to keep coming back.

"6444 Nolensville PikeNashville, TN 37013",4.0,"Blu Fig - Short name, short menu.When I think of Mediterranean food, I think of Falafel, Moosaka, and Baba Gahannouj.  Foods that are as much fun to say as they are to eat.Blu Fig however, misses on all of those.They started in the right direction, with an appetizer menu that contains Dolma, Tabouli, and Hummus, but once you get past the appetizers, you get 4 options - gyro, grilled chicken, salmon, or shrimp.  The first 3 can be served in a pita, all 4 are available as a salad or on a bed of rice.So I was disappointed.  I didn't get to order something funny, like shawarma or matbucha.  The Blu Fig didn't even have Figs on the menu.  If I opened MJ's house of pasta, you can bet I would serve pasta.Then the food came.It started with a smoothie.  It was very good.  Fresh fruit, yogurt, and locally produced honey.  If this place was next to a gym, I could burn off 400 calories and put them right back on all within an hour.Then my gyro came.  It was good.  The meat wasn't greasy, but fat equals flavor, so the meat was a little sad.  Healthy, but bland.  The laban & tahini sauce made up for it though, so they hit their mark.  Where they excelled was with their basmati rice.  Very tasty, despite the fact that they jazzed it up with a bag of mixed frozen vegetables.  Almost floral tasting.I really want to support local eateries, especially ethnic ones.  But the Blu Fig dumbed down their menu too much.  They don't even have ""Gyro"" on the menu, they call it a Yee-Ro.  As if to say; ""Hey you redneck hick, this is how it's pronounced.""  Well you Mediterranean Bluneck, Salmon isn't native to the Mediterranean, and that's a quarter of your menu.Tip:  Be ready for takeout.  Despite the size of the establishment, there are only 4 tables here.  Three of them are 4-tops, and one only seats 2.  Also be aware, that it runs kind of pricey, a lunch for 2 (one plate, one pita wrap, a side of tabouli(so I could order something funny), a diet coke, and a smoothie) ran us $28 not counting tip.  2 1/2 stars, rounded up to 3 because of the rice.",Blu Fig,6159412583.0,63.0,2010-10-29,"Nashville, TN",/biz/blu-fig-nashville,3.0,90,"Nashville, TN",M.

"6444 Nolensville PikeNashville, TN 37013",4.0,"I wasn't expecting much from the place when we walked it (looked to me like a little bubble tea cafe), but was pleasantly surprised by the food. We tried the Lentil Bisque, Plate-O's Delight and a ""Yee-Ro"" Pocket. I subbed a side salad for the chips. The chips looked tasty, but was glad I made the change when I got the food. Their salad is well seasoned, dressing is refreshing, and it includes kalamatas (not those black jarred olives that some local places try to dump on your salad).Everything is made fresh and it tastes like it. It certainly isn't purely authentic Mediterranean, but it's Americanized in a good way. It's not at all like most of the gyros I have eaten either downtown or near Vanderbilt that come in a big fat piece of pita bread with a half cup of sauce spilling all over the place and a bunch of white flavorless tomatoes. I have to disagree with the other reviewers about the flavor. I don't want a bunch of greasy meat on my gyro. Theirs is thinly sliced, crispy on one side and rich in flavor. The wrap is also relatively thin which is exactly how I like it. They don't overdo it on the labin and tahini. You can add more if you're someone who really wants sauce running down your arm while you're trying to eat.The bisque was liquified but still had a nice lentil texture. Also lemon-y without being too acidic. The Plate-O's Delight was a real surprise. It's a briefly pan fried edamame corn succotash finished with a little white wine deglazing. It's nothing fancy, but just tastes great. Tried some baklava for dessert and it was also pretty good. It's also very affordable. ""Yee-Ro"" Pocket is only $5.99 and most of the small plates are under $4. The most expensive item is the $10.99 Salmon Filet. Many of the entree plates are $8.99. More than reasonable for the food quality.Like others I really wish they had falafel and baba ganoush. I'm guessing they could do these well.As other have mentioned this is a small cafe style place. They are limited in the number of seats inside because of only having one bathroom. They said they want to put a couple of tables out on the sidewalk for the spring/summer. While we were there we noticed quite a few people coming in for take out, so that seems like a good option if you're local.Whoever owns this place is lucky to have a couple of the most enthusiastic staff I've almost ever met in a restaurant. The guys who co-manage this place are all about making sure you have a great experience. We placed our order in a short line of a bunch of take out orders, and I think they assumed we wanted it to go. After 10-15 minutes when our food was ready they had a bag ready for us on the counter. I told them we would just eat it here and they apologized at least 5 times. It really wasn't a big deal, but they said they should have asked us and comped us some dessert. I tried to put some extra tip in the tip jar and they swiped the jar off the counter and pleaded with me to keep my money and enjoy the food. Ended up chatting with them a bit after the take out rush subsided and was surprised to find out they weren't the owners. These guys really want to make sure you have a great experience.This is also a bit of a drive for Nashville folks. Probably not so bad if you're near Brentwood.

"1524 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"We ordered a couple burgers to go during Nashville's burger week. Burger week consists of different restaurants creating a signature burger for burger week that they sell for five bucks, with fries included. We were close to SOUTH as we were heading home so we called in the order for two of the burgers & fries. When we arrived to pick them up it seems there was a miscommunication & they'd only had one ready. So we waited for about 15 minutes for the second burger. That seems like a normal time until you take in the fact that this burger was the special for the week & it was at 8pm at night. Anyway. We got the burgers & headed home. I'm usually not a huge fan of take out because it's never as good as in the restaurant, so I'm not taking into account the bun being mushy or the one onion ring being soggy. We toasted the fries & burgers & tried them. The fries were good, but tasted like the fries from Penn Station (that's not a bad thing). The burger had a nice beef flavor, well seasoned & cooked medium, the way I like it. The burger size itself was small, I don't know if it was because of burger week or that's how they normally are.

"1524 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"I found SOUTH to be incredibly disappointing.  Not because of the food or service -- I don't have an opinion either way.  Rather, I was seriously offended by the decor and theme within the restaurant.  For context, the first thing one sees when they enter the bar is three large murals of Andrew Jackson, Robert E. Lee, and Jefferson Davis.  Dotted behind each man are fields of cotton, Souther Belles, and rebel soldiers.  Needless to say, slavery is not depicted in any of the murals. I could say much about Jackson and Lee, but I will simply concentrate on Davis.  The first President of the secessionist Confederate States of America was, upon the end of hostilities, indicted for treason.  Treason, as per the U.S. Constitution is defined very specifically: Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. Davis, though never put on trial out of the Northern spirit of reconciliation, clearly was a traitor against the Union.  Further, Davis was a vocal proponent of slavery.  He is quoted as saying: """"It [slavery] was established by decree of Almighty God...it is sanctioned in the Bible, in both Testaments, from Genesis to Revelation...it has existed in all ages, has been found among the people of the highest civilization, and in nations of the highest proficiency in the arts...Let the gentleman go to Revelation to learn the decree of God - let him go to the Bible...I said that slavery was sanctioned in the Bible, authorized, regulated, and recognized from Genesis to Revelation...Slavery existed then in the earliest ages, and among the chosen people of God; and in Revelation we are told that it shall exist till the end of time shall come. You find it in the Old and New Testaments - in the prophecies, psalms, and the epistles of Paul; you find it recognized, sanctioned everywhere.""  As a principal, I understand the idea of celebrating Southern Heritage.  But what I do not understand is the idea of celebrating Southern Hate.  Davis is perhaps the singular human representation of the armed struggle to maintain slavery.  Indeed, he passionately advocated for slavery as a moral prerogative: ""My own convictions as to negro slavery are strong. It has its evils and abuses...We recognize the negro as God and God's Book and God's Laws, in nature, tell us to recognize him - our inferior, fitted expressly for servitude...You cannot transform the negro into anything one-tenth as useful or as good as what slavery enables them to be.""What in the world the owners of this restaurant were thinking so blatantly displaying these murals is beyond me.  I will add, that though there were African American patrons in the restaurant, for whom I felt a pang of remorse that they had to be subjected to the idolization of a racist traitor, there was not a single African American employee there.  Perhaps I just came at the wrong time.  But probably not.  SOUTH might have had good food, I don't know.  But I do know I will not set foot in there again and I urge all sensible people to avoid becoming complicit in whitewashing the racist history of the Confederacy. Why am I posting this on Yelp?  At the end of the day, this service allows patrons to communicate with other potential customers and offer a review on the full service of a restaurant or business.  I can say as a customer, I felt deeply uncomfortable in SOUTH.  I was horrified that prior to understanding the theme of the restaurant I had invited my African American friend to join me there, and I was deeply saddened at the lack of interest most patrons took in what I thought was nothing short of highly disrespectful decor.  Point being, potential customers have a right to know what they are stepping into to -- a restaurant with an ideological message behind it.-------I will add one more thing.  After my experience at SOUTH, and certainly after seeing the bust of Nathaniel Bedford Forrest, the first Grand Wizard of the Klu Klux Klan, in the State Capitol, I don't have any desire to return to Nashville or Tennessee.  That state needs desperately to exit the 19th century and enter the 21st.

"1524 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Came to visit Nashville for a weekend, and as a big fan of brunch, I was really looking forward to eating at South as their menu looked delicious. So we get there around 11:30 and they are on a wait list. This is totally understandable as brunch is a busy time. However, neither host could even begin to give an estimate of how long the wait would be, no matter how many different ways I phrased the question. I work in the restaurant industry though so I know how stressful being on a wait can be so we headed to the bar.Look, I get it, no one actually enjoys working a brunch shift, but the attitude of the bar staff was deplorable. I mean, really just surly and rude. All the bartenders looked miserable and they were shooting daggers our way every time they walked past us. But whatever, keep our bottomless mimosas filled and you can be as miserable as you want. To be fair, they kept our drinks filled. After waiting an hour and a half, we were finally shown to our table........Which was conveniently right by the speakers. Speakers that were absolutely BLASTING Bob Marley after Bob Marley song (heard the same song 3 times by the way). My guests and I all had to lean in close to scream so that we could even hear each other. I asked our server if it could be turned down and we were told a flat out ""No."" That's how management likes it apparently. We order our food, 4 of us got some eggs benedict thing and one got a grilled cheese. About 15 minutes later, our server comes out to tell us that she accidentally rang up 4 of our orders as the wrong thing but ""its basically the same!' We insisted on the food that we had originally ordered, so she said it would be a few more minutes. Then they bring out my friend's grilled cheese so she gets to eat by herself, while we wait for our food. Mind you, this is all occurring while conversation is absolutely impossible due to the blasting music. The food was fine, nothing special.I can't recommend this place. The food and drinks were not good enough to deal with the rude and inept staff. Furthermore, OH MY GOD MANAGEMENT PLEASE LISTEN TO CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS WHEN THEY ASK TO TURN THE MUSIC DOWN.

The crowd is upscale, there is a small cover and dress code, and the music was fab. A lot of 90's early 00's hip hop mixed in with some of the catchier recent hits. Kept the ladies dancing all night. I have also been here for food. The food itself was well above average. I had the fish and chips, made with catfish.

"501 Union StNashville, TN 37219",4.5,"Two sandwich shops sit across the street from one another, and they couldn't be more different, at least in regards to quality. One one side of 5th Avenue is Subway, with it's Jared-inspired subs heaped with pounds of imported vegetables and funky sauces. For $5 you can get a footlong Italian BMT. But, across 5th, nestled in-between a law firm and a sub-par Tex-Mex joint sits Rae's Gourmet. For all intents and purposes (i.e., eating) it's the only place on this corner that matters. I've been a fan of Rae's for years, but today I decided it had earned a glowing five-star review, complete with all the superlatives and accolades. I don't normally give out 5-star reviews, but Rae's deserves it. It's combination of quality, value, service, and friendliness, makes it a must-visit spot in downtown Nashville. Ask any of the 55,000 downtown employees what they're favorite downtown spots are, and you'll hear Rae's on almost every list. First off, they get all the basics right. Fresh bread, high quality meats and cheeses, and plenty of delicious combinations thereof. I'm a fan of the Angus Po-Boy, which is topped with ""magic mushroom,"" cheese sauce, and tomato (you need a fork to eat it). Also, their take on a Reuben is legit. But even more impressively, they do daily specials, from crab cakes to beer cheese soup. And allow me to pause for a minute to praise this beer cheese soup. Spicy, cheesy, with a hint of lager, it is ri.dic.u.lous. I'm a little sick today, and I think the combo of hot, cheesy, beer-y goodness is nudging me towards healing (insert praise-hands emoji). When you walk into Rae's, you get asked to call your order out from the back of the line. If you've been there before, you get asked if you want what you got last time. If you're a regular, they list your usual choices and ask you to pick. By the time you pay, your food's ready. Yeah. They're that good. You feel just ever-so-slightly cared for in a way that makes you want to come back tomorrow. Don't know what you want? Ask for help. They'll get ya served up right.

BUT, if you haven't spent time at Rae's, I don't know that you've really experienced pure sandwich bliss. If you don't it, you need to fix that now. Today. It's almost lunch time. Rae's caters to the work crowd and isn't as convenient (hours, location and parking). BUT the product is every bit as magical as you might imagine and definitely worth the time and effort it might take to get there.I came here for a work lunch on a busy Friday. It's location on Union is no fun because you know parking is a pain around this area. [Point of Order: Nashville, we have to talk about viable public transit. It's time and your downtown businesses aren't getting as much as business as they should (see my Ichiban review) because you haven't figured out the transit/parking issue. You're, at least, two years late on this fix it.] Once I looped the block a couple of times and suggested* to a woman who was idling in a parking space that she should move, I was able to come in and see what's happening.There's a huge menu board to the right, once you enter, that's filled with specials, sandwich choices and all other goodies. Depending on the day and time, though, you may have to change your plans. I had crab cakes on my mind but arrived too late to enjoy them. Everything's made fresh and to order. Once it's gone, it's gone. I 'settled' on the Wicked Chicken sandwich, bowl of red beans, pomegranate (hallelujah, holla back!) San Pellegrino, and a huge brownie. Lay off me; I was starving.I didn't have to wait too long before my food was ready and I ready to dig in. Oh, you seat yourself after going to the counter and ordering all the food. My sandwich was a stack of chicken, chipotles, lettuce, tomato, and green chili sauce. If it weren't already hot, I could have had my fill from the hot sauce bar that adorns the pay counter. When I tell you this sandwich was incredible... child, please. I was reat' to testify in Rae'. My red beans (to which I *did* add hot sauce) were the perfect compliment to my behemoth of a sandwich. I tried taking small sips of my soda, as this was a San Pellegrino flavor I'd yet to have. #heavenly I was so stuffed, I couldn't fit my brownie in my belly. But, best believe, I destroyed it as a late afternoon snack later that day. Rae's is worth me scheduling meetings downtown JUST so I can go hog-wild on the menu.

They do things their own way here.So, first off, when you see a line, that doesn't mean you find a place that is less busy, that means you wait your turn. The food here takes a bit of time. Say ten minutes for a sandwich after you order. Be prepared for what you want to order. That saves everyone else some precious minutes. However, if you are not sure what to get, be civil and ask those in line around you. We should communicate more and feel as part of the community.Anyhow, I like going on Tuesdays. That is when they have the shrimp po-boy. They feature different sandwiches on different days. They have their core stock menu of about a dozen or more sandwiches with daily specials. They are friendly and to the point. This place does great business during the weekly business lunch rush. Be prepared to have a backup sandwich in mind. Because Rae's makes amazing sandwiches, sometimes they run out of them.I have had a few of the veggie, steak and shrimp sandwiches and have NEVER been disappointed. They have a counter space of about two dozen hot sauces. That just gets me fired-up! Someone have a fire extinguisher? There are many tables, and they fill up quick.

"501 Union StNashville, TN 37219",4.5,"As a long-term employee of several downtown Nashville businesses, I have eaten at most of the restaurants down here. So, I'm uniquely qualified to give my opinion as to what I think is one of the best sandwich shops you will find. Yes, there are an abundance of them, many of the large chains that you'd expect to find, but there are also some smaller, well-crafted places that take their business seriously. Rae's is the best one of these places you will find.Break it down to the important bits:-Service: When you get to the point where you can order (lots of people love Rae's - not just me, so sometimes there are lines), it's always friendly, always helpful (if you aren't sure about what you want) and always willing to treat you like a human, not just the next combo-ordering meat sack standing in line. Mostly this is Fred who has yet to meet someone he couldn't carry on a conversation with, but the others are just as friendly.-Selection: They can make you lots of things if you just ask, but the choices on their menu are well thought out and are all excellent. Many of my co-workers have had everything on the menu and universally rave at how good everything is made.-Contents: Want to see the ingredients they put into their sandwiches? Look over past the drinks on the left as you come in. Seriously high quality deli meats and cheeses. This is important because a sandwich is truly JUST the sum of it's parts. The bread is also fresh and is one of the best parts of the sandwich (especially when you are having the beer cheese soup).They also cater at Rae's and I've had nothing but excellence in the product they provided to me over the years that I have used them for my events. I recommend Rae's to anyone looking for something besides the run-of-the-mill $5 foot-long. There are plenty of those places downtown willing to take your money for their ten cents worth of ingredients. Go to Rae's because you want a really good sandwich put together by quality people who take pride in their work and their business.

Still plenty of food and you will not be tempted to eat the whole thing (believe me you will not want to stop.)In addition to fantastic sandwiches they also have a rotating selection of soups and excellent salads, oh and don't forget the fresh brownies.  The staff is always friendly and will get to know your name if you go often enough. The only downsides is that it can get very crowded during the lunch rush and it is in an out of the way location if you do not work in the downtown area.

"592 12th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Forewarning: Like any restaurant in the Gulch, parking may be difficult to come by at times unless you valet so I am not going to knock it for that. Gourmet Mexican would be the best way to describe this place. When you walk in you'll notice right away the plan is to make it feel like a more upscale Mexican restaurant with a decent size bar and tables/booths in the dining area. I will say generally I am not a fan of booths because I feel cramped but we were able to fit 4 people (2 per side) very comfortably so that was nice. The waitress we had was very informative about the menu and she recommended some of her personal favorites as well as customer favorites. We started off with the guacamole, which the waitress made in front of us at the table asking what ingredients we would like to include with the guacamole. Just the fact they made it in front of you and asked how you wanted the guacamole was pretty impressive plus it was delicious! The chips/salsa are complimentary and the salsas were very tasty and had a little heat to them but were not overwhelming. The food itself (and you can tell right away from looking at the menu) is a little overpriced relatively compared to other Mexican restaurants. Part of the reason some Mexican is awesome is because you'll get a lot of delicious food for a pretty cheap price.

"592 12th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"This review is based from a recent event I attended that was for Nashville bloggers, in which we were able to preview the upcoming valentine's Day menu. Parking - it's a good thing they have valet parking because as everyone knows, parking is a nightmare at the Gulch. The interior is very nice, it's described as an upscale Mexican restaurant, but if you were to walk into the restaurant without being told it was a Mexican restaurant, you wouldn't know what the cuisine was. I really enjoyed the lighting in the restaurant. It's not dark, but has some dim areas, it's kind of sexy, if lighting can be sexy. All the materials look high end. It looks like a place that would charge ten dollars for guacamole (which they do). Drinks - I had two of the Cinco Rita which is pretty much a classic margarita. At 13 dollars a piece, they're not cheap but they are strong & served in a large martini shaped glass. It's not a fishbowl margarita glass like a lot of Mexican restaurants do. We were able to preview the ($35) 3 course valentine's Day menu that also had an optional $15 cocktail pairing. Total for valentines day meal with paired drinks would be $50. I'll get to ""value"" in a moment. The Valentine's Especialidad-Starter - I had the Ensalada De Mango, mango with jicama, seasoned pumpkin seeds, grapes, mint & queso fresco with a honey vinaigrette. The salad was fresh & nice. I more so tasted the grapes than anything else. Starter drink - peach berry flaca flip, tequila and fresh lime juice with peach syrup and triple sec, topped with club soda and strawberry flip of DeKuyer Strawberry Pucker. Okay, I'm not a huge fan of sweet drinks, I had a couple sips & had to stop because the sweetness burn was hurting my throat. I don't know if it had sweet & sour mix in it or what, but I wasn't a fan. I looked around the room & most people only had a few drinks of it. Main - Camarones con Pasilla Mango mole, sautéed shrimp with spicy mango mole sauce. I enjoyed the 7 shrimp that were served. The mole sauce was good, but they put way too much cilantro on the shrimp & rice. It had about half a plant of cilantro on it. I had to pick most of it off. It was served with a small amount of rice and a scoop of mashed sweet potatoes that had some type of fruit mixed in. Some people at the table thought apple because it was so firm, others thought mangos. No one knew. I know that shrimp is a high dollar item & nowadays you never get that many, & I'm okay with that, but give some more rice. The other options were steak that was served with a huge amount of mashed potatoes & chicken that was served with a large amount of rice. Main drink - passionfruit margarita, Herradura silver tequila, passionfruit syrup, fresh lime. I couldn't drink this. It was way too fake sweet. It had too much sweet & sour mix. It made me want another Cinco Rita. Everyone at my table only had a sip or two of this passion fruit concoction. Dessert - strawberry buñuelos, fresh strawberries, whipped cream and vanilla ice cream on cinnamon chips. I think there was a problem in the kitchen, because it was just a fried tortilla with cinnamon and sugar, whipped cream & strawberries. There was no ice cream. I didn't realize the error until halfway through & thought ""this would be good with ice cream."" I asked around & no one had ice cream with the strawberry dessert. The churro dessert had vanilla & a cinnamon ice cream on it, but the menu made no mention of ice cream with it. Dessert drink - heart warmer, corazón añejo, baileys & coffee. This was my favorite of the paired cocktails. I'm not a hugh coffee drinker, but who doesn't love Baileys & coffee? Service - we were treated like royalty. I don't know if it had to do that it was a room full of food bloggers & bloggers, but we were waited on hand & foot & everyone was very friendly. The chef and general manager came out and spoke with us about the menu and were very engaging. A server named Bethanny was amazing! Valentine's value? If I had paid 50 dollars for what I had, I would've probably given this review a 2 star. The food was good, but not great, two of the drinks were not drinkable.

Cool patio area, large oversized booths and great overall location in the Gultch!Food was tasty and everyone enjoyed what they ordered... So why would I not return??Here is what disappointed me:First off, We opted for the fresh table-side made guacamole. It runs $10. Not unheard of for this type of appetizer. However, they used ONE avocado... Seriously!?!? Second:Our server was rushing us the entire time (in a passive aggressive way) he delivered our main course barely 5 minutes after getting our appetizer and 10 minutes after taking our order. Then he was asking about desert before any of the four of us halfway finished our main course. It didn't stop there! He would continue to stop by and ask us about dessert every 5 minutes! At one point I asked him to give us at least 20 minutes. And he came back again in 5 again...The moral is this:Ambiance/vibe/location: 4Food: 4Service: 2Maybe you'll get a better server.

She said she just seated them, and I asked her in which direction, she said she didn't know, I would have to walk around the restaurant to find them. Call me crazy, but if you are a competent hostess, and you just told me that YOU seated the party yourself, shouldn't you know the layout of the restaurant well enough to know which area holds the tables large enough for a party of 10+? There's nothing I hate more than sitting down to a nice dinner and having some other patron hovering near my table searching for their party, and I didn't want to be that person so I called the phones of a few in my group. Unfortunately, we are not phones out on the table during dinner type of people and the atmosphere in the restaurant is loud, so no once heard their phones. So I was left to roam the restaurant, which I'd never been to before, in search of my party. When I finally found my group, I told them what happened, they said they'd literally only been seated about 3 mins and another friend said the hostess had been dismissive of her as well when she asked if the party had been seated. Dinner: I chose a combination dinner of some sort that had a chile relleno and two other items on it, which I can't recall. It was far overpriced at $18, and something I could get at any other Mexican place in town for $10 or less. Someone at the table insisted that we try the ""made in front of you"" guacamole, so we did. Clearly the ingredients were fresh, but to me there is a benefit to letting guacamole ""rest"" after making it, to let the flavors really have time to mesh. The portion was also ridiculously small for the price. Did you really just make a bowl of guacamole with one avocado for, if I recall, almost $10?

Though compared to the entree, it was awesome in comparison. Sad that the apetitizer is more appealing than the entree itself.)While we sipped on our margarita and munched on our queso dip, our militant server left us be for some time to mull over the menu. There wasn't much on the menu except a galore combinations of enchiladas! After a good 30 minutes, I decided on the Enchiladas Veracruz and my husband opted for the Tacos Cascabel.

My husband's dish was mediocre, but by all means better than my entree.The price for Mexican food was not overly priced, though still overly priced for Mexican food coming out of a can.

Housed smack in the middle of the Gulch which is the new ""urban hotspot"" for upper 20's to upper 30's (and a few beyond). 2)FANTASTIC people-watching. Eye candy is great--you can sit out on the mid-sized patio and watch the inflows of young professionals to hipsters to celebs visit Watermark, Sambuca, Ru Sans, and Urban Outfitters, not to mention the folks that live in Icon and Terazzo (Cantina is actually on the first floor of the Icon). Inside at the bar is just as appealing--never know who you'll see belly up to the sleek, modern design...last time I was there I saw 2 Titans players and one of the guys from ZZ Top who allegedly lives here. Random? Yes. Funny? Heck yes. 3)Well, there is no 3. That concludes what I love about Cantina. Why I don't love it... 1)Drinks. They are overpriced and NOT GOOD. Stay away from the mojitos especially. Very syrupy and WAY too sugary. I am sticking with bottled beer there from now on. Can't mess that up too much. 2)Food. Which unfortunately is a big part of what makes or breaks a restaurant. And it's just not good. They pride themselves on their table-side guacamole, but I've had it once and I've passed on it ever since. It's pricey ($12) and desperately needed salt. We felt like we had to keep adding stuff to it in order for it to have any flavor whatsoever. I had shrimp enchiladas on one visit that just tasted rubbery and fishy (didn't finish them), had the ""special"" once that was some sort of chicken burrito with a white sauce--WAY too thick and rich, and I couldn't even find the chicken--and the last chance I gave Cantina was chicken tacos. BLAND as all get out. Literally, just flour tortillas and unseasoned chicken with a few tomatoes thrown in. And a side of rice that needed seasoning as well. All for about $16. 3)Atmoshphere of the dining area...it's just a huge room with really high ceilings and a bunch of tables. It was so loud we could barely hear our waiter. We all agreed that it was kind of like eating in a hotel lobby. I like the bar area much better--it's a little more intimate and you can actually hear your dining mates talk.

"4015 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"As a long time Zoe's customer, I cannot say enough good things about this place. I used to frequent both locations in Columbia, South Carolina so I was stoked when I found out they had one in Nashville. Today was my third visit to the Nashville location. As expected during lunch hour the place was bustling with activity. The very friendly cashier (didn't get her name) engaged my husband and I in conversation. I inquired about the formal process of requesting a Zoe's near our house. She then referred me to Blake the manager. I was impressed by both Blake and the cashier. They both had very warm personalities and were resourceful in regards to answering my questions. The food experience here is wonderful, remaining consistent with the other Zoe's I have had the pleasure of visiting. Two things I wanted to address... One reviewer stated when she visited Zoe's there was food on the floor. Zoe's stays pretty busy due to their popularity. Today I witnessed toddlers dropping food in an attempts to stuff their faces. Due to the busy nature of this establishment and the number of children visiting at any given time I can see how it may be difficult to stay right on top of the floors all the time. I have never had an inclination to believe this or any other Zoe's I have visited was dirty and unfit for dining. And I am a pretty picky person.Secondly, I heard ppl state the food was bland. If you are seeking massive amounts of MSG, sugar, and salt to flavor your food I suggest you visit Krystal's or Burger King. The concept behind Zoe's is healthy, fresh, and wholesome food. I personally still absolutely dig the seasonings they use and the taste of the food as do other reviewers by almost unanimous opinions on Yelp. So please realize their food is an excellent alternative to calorie and fat laden processed food. Better yet, go try it yourself. If you don't like it --- then don't return! :)And whoever reads this --- Zoe's can you please open a location in Smyrna, Tennessee on Sam Ridley Parkway???

"4015 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"While running some petit-bourgeois errands in the petit-bourgeois Hill Center, we decided to stop here for lunch. I figured it had a dieresis in its name (or umlaut for the more heavy metal-inclined among us) so it should probably be as good, or at least as pretentious as Provence. Zoë's Kitchen's menu aims for a California/Mediterranean Nouvelle-Cuisine meets fun fast food aesthetic. The offerings heavily rely on grilled chicken breast, i.e. the most bland meat imaginable. I had a Gruben sandwich (grilled Reuben) which came with a choice of side salad and a bag of chips, which is a pretty good deal considering that the sandwiches are not really that big. The sandwich was quite delicious when I started it but got progressively less tasty as I continued eating it, which might just attest to how hungry I was when I got there. I had some major food envy at my dining partner's Greek Salad, which was good, but served with cold pita bread.Also, not being one to pass up some fat-people-food, I tried the Ya-Ya chocolate slab cake (the only dessert they offer) and it completely saved the meal. It tastes vaguely of cake mix but it is covered generously with gooey chocolate frosting which is then covered in... coarse sugar crystals? I don't know if this is a Southern thing I've missed but it is delicious either way.The fountain drink sizes here range from big to ginormous, which I like. It is a charming space, all minimalist plus bright colors (very IKEA) and what appeared to be children's artwork scattered about. It is also, in all fairness, not at all a pretentious place to eat like I thought it would be. I was surprised and mildly annoyed that the food was served on polystyrene plates; the place gives off an impression that it might be a little more environmentally responsible than that. Overall, it was not a terrible meal, but I'm a little bit sad that I didn't get tacos at Baja Fresh instead.

"5560 Nolensville PikeNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"I cannot believe I actually found a restaurant in Nashville that serves real Mexican food. Not even just real Mexican food, but even authentic Aztec dishes. I would say that I could die now, but I really want to go back to Fogatas.Virtually all the food at every Mexican restaurant in Nashville I've eaten at tastes exactly the same as every other, and I've eaten at dozens of them. It's like they all share the same gigantic automated kitchen somewhere in Metro Center, where re-fried beans and salsa are stored in enormous silos and then pumped all over town through a network of tubes.And none of it tastes like it's supposed to. I lived in Los Angeles for more than 20 years, and I understand the difference between authentic Mexican and Mexican-American food. Both of the can be great, and neither of them involve cheese dip. Fogatas does Mexican food best.The owner, Junior, actually sat down at my table, and pulling up pictures on his smartphone, explained dishes and ingredients to me that I was not familiar with (which is amazing, considering I have been eating Mexican food all my life)...then he had samples of those foods brought to my table for me to try.Shut the front door! That right there is some fantastic freakin' customer service! I was blown away and the food was off the chain.I sampled two dishes I cannot pronounce. One was made from Corn Smut--like I'm not gonna try something called 'Smut'. Corn Smut (I encourage you to look up a picture) is a fungus that grows on corn. It looks like a big cancerous corn tumor. I really cannot say anything nice about the appearance of corn smut and am convinced that this food was first eaten as some kind of punishment. The corn smut is pureed, which turns it into a loose, black slime. It is cooked with onions and peppers and other spicy stuff and served in a folded, grilled corn tortilla. It did not look delicious. It looked like a baby had pooped into a taco and then sat on it.However, it was delicious. The homemade corn tortillas were freakin'  fantastic and it was the best tasting smut I had ever had! Smut tastes kind of like pureed mushrooms (which also doesn't sound great, I guess) but it is deeply earthly and salty, kind of like mushroom and miso. Vegetarians in particular would love this dish. It was awesome and I would definitely order it again.I also sampled another Aztec dish that was made with sqash flowers and squash meat, onions and other veggies. It was quite spicy, had a little cheese on it and was also served on a folded grilled tortilla. Fantastic. Again, vegetarians should run, not walk to this restaurant. It was fabulous.The ""sample"" dishes were huge (although according to Junior, they were tiny by comparison to the actual dishes) and I was full, so ordered carnitas to go, which were also quite good, even many hours later.Junior clearly loves to educated people (especially us gringos) about authentic Mexican food.

"811 Gleaves StNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"I don't know who this Erica is that a couple other reviewers have mentioned (probably a friend of theirs) but she must not have been working last night because there was NO ONE amazing behind that bar! I hate to be so negative but seriously, the bar was a complete joke. My boyfriend and I stood at that bar for about 15 minutes before we were even recognized. There was only one other couple at the bar and they already had drinks in front of them. There was about 4-5 employees/servers/bartenders (?) scurrying back and forth behind the bar like they had no idea what was going on and couldn't see 2 people standing there staring at them. Normally I would speak up and ask for a drink but I wanted to see just how long we would stand there before we were acknowledged. Finally we were acknowledged but it was still over 5 minutes before anyone actually took our order. I asked for a glass of Riesling, which was on the menu, but they were out. I picked another wine and was served a tiny plastic cup of it for $6. WHY it was in a plastic cup, I have no idea. I saw a whole shelf of wine glasses behind the bar. If I had known I would be walking around with a plastic cup of wine like I was at frat party I would have ordered something else. I paid with cash and it took almost another 15 min to get my change. She didn't have enough change in the drawer (I was owed $11) and it literally took like 3 people to handle this terrible change shortage. I watched several people behind the bar talk about money, 2 different people put money into the register, and STILL had to ask for my change after she had clearly forgotten what she was supposed to be doing and apparently couldn't see us still standing there. By the time I finally had a drink in my hand I was already over it but there ARE a couple of nice things I can say about the place. Immediately upon entering we were greeted by a man named Dominique. He shook our hands and welcomed us. Ladies are free until 11 but my bf had to pay a $10 cover which seemed a little steep for what the place had going on. The bar is the first thing you see when you walk in and although small, it's nice and aesthetically pleasing. They just need to FOR REAL step up the service. But enough about that.....The main area of the club is very dark which is cool by me. Lots of nice, modern couches and several tables and chairs. Honestly, it reminded me of the after hours club eXceSs that used to be on Church St. , minus the lovable crackheads, techno music, stray pills, and abandoned blow pops on the floor. This was a more adult (but not old) crowd who clearly had a little more sense. The DJ was playing a great mix of soul and hip hop with lot's of Erykah Badu, Common, and Jill Scott. After the crowd picked up around 10:30 he moved on to more current, mainstream ""hip hop."" Notice the quotation marks. Overall, this is an OK spot to chill and listen to some good tunes but that whole bar experience really left me with a bad taste in my mouth.

McCabe used to be a lot cheaper before they decided to make all of their vegetables available a la carte, which seems like something only a much fancier restaurant should do. I didn't go there for a while after that, but I've recently kind of forgiven them for that because their food is still good.  I'm a big fan of the squash casserole. They have the prettiest patio I've ever seen. It's surrounded by potted plants, but mysteriously, they say that ABC won't let them serve alcohol outside, so the night I went, a beautiful night, the inside was crowded and no one was sitting on the patio. I'm confused because lots of other restaurants in Nashville let you drink on their patios. It just seems like a shame. They also don't have any beer on draft. They do have a good selection of bottled beer to make up for it, but they only have one variety of Yazoo, which is also a disappointment.Overall though, you won't be disappointed by the food and the atmosphere is great.

"4410 Murphy RdNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"I had heard a lot of great things about this place and am sorry to say I was a little disappointed upon trying it out.  First off I think that for them to describe themselves as a pub is incredibly misleading.  How can a place that does not serve any beer on draft at all claim to be a pub?!  I mean don't fresh frothy brews on tap compose the basic fundamentals of what makes up a pub?  Secondly the interior setup is quite confusing, there is staff hovering around the entrance, yet you are supposed to seat yourself.  The bar area comprises the center of the room, with all the additional available space being filled with tables.  Their daily specials board is quite extensive, but to the point where it makes you indecisive.  Since it was our first visit here we didn't really know what was going on and the staff was not very quick to help us out which was frustrating. Their menu encompasses a wide range of options, mostly in a southern comfort food type styling.  I'd heard great things about their French fries, so I was sure to make sure I ordered some.  I found the food here to be a great disappointment.  There's such a huge emphasis on 'home made' style cooking.  Their menu states repeatedly how the majority of their sauces and dressings are all made in house from their own recipes.  I found the food overall to be majorly lacking in flavor.  Their 'buffalo' sauce had no kick to it at all and the chicken pieces it was served on tasted like cardboard.  Their fries were obviously hand cut which was great, but they completely lacked seasoning.  I might as well have been eating raw potato sticks for the amount of flavor they had.  Their homemade blue cheese was also incredibly bland, which is actually quite a feat as the cheese that comprises blue cheese dressing is pungently flavored in and of itself.My boyfriend had the fish and chips, which was just as lacking in flavor as my meal was.  I don't even remember what type of fish it was supposed to be, but I remember that it just tasted like fish sticks you could find in the freezer section at your grocery store.  The single standout was the Mexican cornbread he ordered.  That was actually quite flavorful and delicious and was cooked perfectly.  Maybe they'd do better if they slimmed down their menu offerings and stuck to doing a smaller variety of food well instead of a ton of different types mediocriley.We originally came to McCabe's to grab a bite to eat while watching a football game.  Which would be pretty typical behavior if the place you were going to was actually a pub and not just claiming to be one like McCabe.  They did in fact have the game on several TVs that were scattered throughout the restaurant, but there was no sound.  When we inquired as to whether they would turn the volume up so we could hear the game, they said oh no we never have the sound on.  By this time we had already ordered our food and were stuck there watching a muted TV trying to figure out what was going on.  As soon as we finished eating we left immediately and went to one of our more regular haunts to watch the rest of the game (which I might add was a fairly important one).Yes McCabe's has a lovely outdoor patio area but it looks out of place and is more suited to drinking coffee in, not drinking a beer.  Yes their food is mostly homemade and their recipes they cook from are original, but with a serious lack of flavor what does that really matter?  You can find McCabe's in the Sylvan Park area, which is a neat neighborhood I intend to explore further.  I just hope some of the other businesses can do a better job of representing this area.",McCabe Pub,6152699406.0,170.0,2009-01-23,"Nashville, TN",/biz/mccabe-pub-nashville,2.0,50,"Nashville, TN",Courtney B.,36.1622296,-86.774353,36.1622296,-86.774353,0.0,True,3660.0

And honestly if the service was better I would probably be ordering takeout a couple times a week. My two experiences with weren't the worst ever, but I was disappointed.The first time I ordered Vindaloo curry and garlic naan. I had purchased their $6 for $10. When I got to the restaurant the man at the door said I could not use the coupon because what I ordered what not a dinner entree. I left after getting my food a little angry because I had read the fine print on the voucher and it said nothing about ordering a dinner entree. The food was decent. I was a big fan of the garlic naan. The vindaloo sauce, however, was just ok. It definitely seemed less authentic that other Indian places I have had in the Nashville area that are in the same price range. And less fresh somehow.The second time, I thought I had everything down. I ordered vegetable curry extra hot with garlic naan. Thinking this time that I would definitely be able to use that coupon I purchased. When I arrived to pick up my order the same gentleman was at the door. He almost didn't honor my coupon this time. I don't know what the issue was other than he didn't seem to want to give me this discount. Reluctantly he honored it saying he would ""this time"".

When we walked in we were seated right away. There was only 2 tables of people eating and we were seated right behind the loudest, most obnoxious group of Mexican men. Don't get me wrong, I'm not going all rascist here (Im half Hispanic myself) but I guess because they were speaking Spanish they assumed the rest of the restaurant couldn't understand them. I'm sure most people know enough to understand swearing and derogatory words, especially when they wait for the waitress to bend over to clean the tables and the whole group starts laughing. Now I can't hold what that group of men did against the restaurant but I am surprised that nothing was said to them by management. So yeah...my dining experience was a bit awkward and uncomfortable.Now on to the food. We started with Nachos Supremos for an appetizer. We told our server we would be splitting it yet she only brought out one dish and disappeared. The meat was seasoned well and it tasted really good but the set up was a bit awkward. Instead of using diced tomatoes, they put a whole slice on the top which meant we had to cut it up ourselves. Secondly, the toppings weren't cut into smaller pieces so it was hard to scoop onto a chip. The lettuce chunks were huge and the steak was thin but long. But again it all tasted good past that! For the main course I ordered 2 enchiladas w/rice and beans. I had never been here before so I asked the server if we could mix and match enchiladas or if they had to be the same. She said we could mix so I told her I wanted one chicken and one beef. When she brought it out I had a combination of chicken and beef in each one. I didn't realize this is what she did until after she was gone so I had to wait awhile before flagging her down to let her know the mistake that was made. She was able to correct it but it seemed real important to her to explain how she got confused and try to repeat back our whole ordering conversation to justify it. I just smiled and said it was okay but could I please have my food. When she brought it out, she had them on 2 separate plates...not sure why. They could easily fit on one plate and were originally delivered on one plate so...yeah. She hadn't really cleared off our table so I'm looking around like where are we going to fit this. I was able to put them on my original plate and stack the rest.

There are no German restaurants where I live, so when we visited Nashville and drove by Gerst Haus I was eager to give it a try.We arrived on a Sunday evening for dinner. The side entrance was blocked by two cars, so we had to circle around to access the entrance on the one-way Interstate Road. The large dining room was about 1/3 full. We were seated in the bar area and the bartender quickly took our drink order. My husband and I both ordered water - obviously unfiltered tap water (weird after taste).We both ordered jäger schnitzel, which was advertised to come with brown gravy,  fresh rye bread and two sides. We both ordered cucumbers and onions in sour cream sauce, I ordered applesauce and the hubs ordered spaetzle. When our plates arrived we were both given pumpernickel bread, which was dry and tasted and looked like Pepperidge Farms. The brown gravy tasted like Heinz brown gravy from a jar. The veal was not pounded thin, was relatively tough and had no flavor. There was too much breading and it only tasted of salt and pepper. The applesauce was served room temperature and tasted cheap and over sweet. The cucumbers were over ripe (soft, not crisp). The only thing remotely decent was the spaetzle - and really, it should be since it's super easy to make.For this mediocre-at-best meal we paid $48. I felt like they should at least hold me after.

"301 Woodland StNashville, TN 37213",3.0,"Having spent a little time in the cities of Frankfurt and Köln in Germany, I'm a little bit of a German food snob.  While the Gerst Haus isn't a replacement for the amazing food I had across the pond, I nevertheless give high marks to all three of the times I've visited it in the past year.In terms of atmosphere, what you get at the Gerst Haus depends a lot on what night and what time you go.  In our first trip there, we arrived late on a weeknight and were the only people in the joint.  For our second trip, we went on a Friday just before 8 p.m. (the same day of the Nashville 5K race), and it was very bustling with people and the Oompa band.  We even had a 20 minute wait for a table -- not a big deal, though, as it gave us a chance to go to the bar and grab a couple fishbowl beers before sitting down. A review of any German restaurant would be remiss without discussing the beer choices.  Gerst Haus has well over a dozen different options on tap.  Most of them are pretty mainstream, but a couple you should try that you might not find at other bars would be the 2012 (a rich black lager) and the Gerst Haus amber lager.  One observation:  while you might assume the 16 oz fishbowls are the better deal, it's worth looking at the menu.  There are a few instances (like the house lager) where the 10 oz price per ounce is actually better.I don't think there's anything we've ordered there that we haven't liked.  We usually start off with the sausage sampler ($10 on the appetizers menu) that easily could be a meal by itself.  The plate is full of...yep, you guessed it, lots of different sausages.  Accompanied by rye bread and a side (the menu has one listed, but they're happy to make substitutions), it's a lot of food.You can go a couple different directions for your entree.  They offer combination platters where you can try three of their specialties, or if you want to dive into one item you know you love, you can do that too.  We've had very good luck with the beef stroganoff, the wiener schnitzel (breaded veal), and the jäeger schnitzel (which tops the wiener schnitzel with a brown mushroom sauce).  The sides are also excellent -- the red cabbage is sweet and flavorful, and you really can't go wrong with the spätzle.  You get two sides with your entree; last time, I ordered a double of spätzle and ate it all.Entree prices aren't totally cheap (you're just under $20 for the combination platters, and most of the standalone entree plates seem to be in the $14-$18 range).  However, the portions are generous, and the flavor's quite good.  If you've been hankering German food -- or if you've never had it but have been interested in trying it -- I'd highly recommend stopping by the Gerst Haus.",The Gerst Haus,6152448886.0,62.0,2011-02-08,"Washington, DC",/biz/the-gerst-haus-nashville,4.0,117,"Nashville, TN",Brian S.,36.1622296,-86.774353,38.8949549,-77.03664559999999,566.7091028370318,False,2749.0

"5356 Hickory Hollow PkwyNashville, TN 37013",3.5,"""Eat, Drink, and Be Local"", it says on the back of the 360 Burger t-shirts.I am not a drinker, so the offering of a selection of craft beers does not resonate with me and my dinner experience. But the time, money, and space that would have been taken up by such things were better spent on the incredible burgers and other sandwiches coming out of the kitchen at such an unassuming spot outside of Nashville.With a name like 360 Burger, the specialty is not a mystery but the secret that sets this particular place apart is one that is becoming a trend throughout the country: a commitment to fresh, local ingredients. Fresh ingredients, prepared correctly, simply taste different, and in the best way possible. Those who know and love food, especially burgers, cannot be disappointed.  The beef for the burgers at 360 is touted as ""certified grass-fed, DNA-trackable beef"". Once again, taste the difference. The beef is expertly prepared, no matter which burger is being delivered to the table, and the flavor that comes through is one that cannot be duplicated at a national chain, much less a fast food restaurant that is accessible on every city block. The added touch is the selection of breads available for each burger, ranging from a classic brioche bun to a delicious pretzel bun to Texas Toast or a fresh croissant. Burger King may tell people they can have it their way, but 360 Burger delivers on that statement in a far bigger and better fashion.The Bacon Basil Pesto burger is one of the more unique flavor combinations on the menu, no matter which protein it is paired with (burger, salmon, turkey, or chicken). As a traditional burger, the unmistakable basil pesto is accented by the smoky Applewood bacon and the woody flavor of the Swiss cheese. The Farm Boy is touted as ""breakfast on a bun"", and that statement is not a joke.  A breakfast burger with ham and a fried egg, pulled together with maple cream cheese on a croissant, the concept is easy and the flavors are bold but the execution is a problem. The croissant is massive, making an already large burger almost unworkable.  Don't get me wrong, I like a big, messy burger experience. Very quickly, though, the Farm Boy goes from a sloppy burger to a knife-and-fork diner garbage plate, trying to assemble all the pieces together bite by bite, rather than retaining the ability to eat the sandwich by hand. The burger is served on the croissant by default, but Texas Toast is a better option in this instance. But it is delicious no matter what!Carnivores don't just feast on red meat, and the Blackened Salmon is the best option for those who want something a little different.  Let's face it, salmon is easy to screw up, as is nearly any fish. The salmon at 360 is seasoned and prepared perfectly, and that is what counts. With a brioche bun, lettuce, and tomato, what is already far more than just a fish sandwich is taken to another level with a fresh, rich garlic aioli and is paired beautifully with the buttery salmon and its Cajun seasoning. The Blackened Salmon burger is the best overall option for those seeking a healthy meal packed with a variety of flavors.If eating healthy is not a priority when you walk through the door, forget the menu and order the Slippery Pig. The foundation is what is generally known as a ""Juicy Lucy"" burger, in this instance stuffed with Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses along with bacon bits, then topped with American cheese, more bacon, and garnished with leaf lettuce and tomato. Everything a burger seeks in a burger is present on the Slippery Pig. The pretzel bun and the brioche bun are both excellent choices for the Slippery Pig.Side items may not be a featured dish at a restaurant of any kind, but are worthy of attention when they are so good that they stand out when placed next to an equally impressive entree.  The sweet potato fries are some of the best I have ever had. Obviously made fresh and not frozen, the fries were crispy and go well with a side of ranch. If your conscience will not allow you to pair a giant burger with a deep fried side, the fresh steamed broccoli was quite good as well.The service was fast, friendly, and attentive. The atmosphere was modern, bright, and features a permanent setup for live music performances that are a weekly fixture. Parking is plentiful and convenient, and the establishment is located next to the Game Galaxy Arcade, sure to be a hit with any video game loving Millennial like myself.Overall, 360 Burger is a gem, and sure to be a hit with every foodie that is in the greater Nashville area. Sadly, it is six hours from my home in southern West Virginia, but with more and more travel in the works in the coming months, every trip to and through Nashville will include a stop at 360 Burger. This place is not just a restaurant, it's a destination for those who consider food to be a personal passion, because those at 360 certainly do, and the evidence shines through on every plate.",360 Burger,6157308798.0,15.0,2015-07-21,"Beckley, WV",/biz/360-burger-nashville,5.0,141,"Nashville, TN",Brad C.,36.1622296,-86.774353,37.77817020000001,-81.18815570000002,328.4945627842471,False,4976.0

The waffle fries were hot & delicious, just needed a little more salt.

I had to be mindful of that when placing my bun on the plate so I wouldn't get the bun soggy. I was very happy the burger was cooked to order. The meat has a nice flavor, the thing was LOADED with Swiss cheese & mushrooms which made me very happy. The prices are very reasonable.

"5356 Hickory Hollow PkwyNashville, TN 37013",3.5,"My brother, boyfriend, and I decided to check out 360 on Saturday in our continuing quest to find the best burger in Nashville. We got there around 1:30 and it was pretty empty, maybe about 3 or 4 other parties there besides us. It has a pretty relaxed vibe, and the AC was cranked in there, I was freezing my buns off. Parking is good because it's in a strip mall, so no worries there.For checking in on Yelp, I got a free appetizer. Yay! So we opted for the fried pickles, which were pretty dang tasty. I had the Cilantro Avocado Burger with sweet potato fries. The men had some other stuff that I can't remember off the top of my head. But we all were in universal agreement that the fries (regular and sweet) were not that good. It's not that they didn't have flavor, but it's almost like they weren't cooked enough, or had been sitting around for a while before we got them. They were just kinda soggy and greasy, which was disappointing.The burger was actually pretty legit. I thought it had some good flavor and a reasonable amount of heat. I'm not tolerant of hardly any spice, and I thought it was just the right amount. I got the burger on the pretzel bun, which I would definitely advise of anyone doing because it was delicious. We didn't have a problem with the order taking that other people seemed to have, so I was happy about that.The service was good. Our waiter (I can never remember their names) was really friendly and even gave me some suggestions when I was trying to pick out a beer, of which they have an extensive variety. But he did check back in like 10 times throughout the meal, so we concluded that he must have been pretty bored. There weren't a lot of tables, though, so it's understandable.

"5356 Hickory Hollow PkwyNashville, TN 37013",3.5,"So glad I finally made it over to Antioch to try 360 burger. I spent the morning at Percy Priest Lake Beach. Since I was in the area, I stopped by 360 burger after I heard good things. Wow one of the few times that a restaurant exceeded the hype. Two words: Pretzels Rolls. Amazing. As a Philly native there are few things I enjoy more than a  soft pretzel. Its one of my must haves as soon as I land in Philly. So I'm skeptical when people try to duplicate it. But 360 burger's pretzel rolls rock. The mix of salty and chewy was the perfect compliment to the juicy delicious burger. I got the basic cheeseburger with grilled onions. IT wasn't basic it was very well seasoned. And it was huge, I took half of it home. The sweet potato fries and aioli mayo were delicious. They were thin cut and crispy but not overdone. So many times when people try to do thin cut fries they overcook them. I was very impressed that these sweet potato fries were perfect. Also got a ton of the fries. Ended up taking about half of them home with my half of a burger. My waiter was friendly and attentive (disclaimer, I came in for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon and the restaurant was not very crowded.). Anyway, he offered my a water to go, which I always appreciate and he got e a lid so I could take the aioli home.

The staff was very attentive and the atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming with a stage set-up for live nighttime music.  I invite you to visit their website and drop by the 360 Burger soon.  It is quickly becoming very popular and now I understand why it is one more successful restaurant presented by the Swett family.  The Antioch area is thriving with a very active housing market, new businesses, green space, and future projects being solidified for the upcoming next few years.  The 360 Burger is one more attractive option to eat while on the southeast side of town.",360 Burger,6157308798.0,13.0,2013-06-22,"Nashville, TN",/biz/360-burger-nashville,4.0,141,"Nashville, TN",Kenneth B.,36.1622296,-86.774353,36.1622296,-86.774353,0.0,True,1249.0

After months of waiting for the right time to try this place out and the expectancy of a great grass fed burger I'm left speechless. From the moment  me and my two children stepped foot in the restaurant I could sense this place was starting to disappoint. There were no host or hostess at the podium, there was a awful band playing extremely loud music in the far left hand corner and to top it off the dining area was poorly illuminated. This place reeked of disaster. I approached the bar and asked, ""can we be seated"" and we were guided to a table that had the light flickering on and off intermittently. So as we sat there for nearly 12 minutes I prepped the kids and stated that in three more minutes we are leaving if we do not get our drinks. At long last, on the fourteenth minute we had a waiter. They must have had two waiters for about 30 people. I couldn't believe it. Our burger experience just kept growing worse. We received our appetizer promptly after all it was just queso and chips. Our main grub now that's another story. The only upside is this, they did make good on the 50% off appetizer that is offered through Yelp and because of the extra long wait for our burgers they did give us a free appetizer. But that's where it ends because I have never in my life tasted a burger without texture and mushy before in my life. Ugh just thinking about it now just... I don't know if they can be called burgers or not it reminds me more of a patty made from soggy bread totally disgusting.

Also I had a few other lunch plans fall through and was in the area alone and not wanting a chain burger. I had heard about this place on another site (newschannel 5's story about the new hockey rink expansion). I do take this review with a grain of salt, literally, because a burger is a burger is a burger. That aside, I know that there are a TON of things going on in this area as far as expansion and revitalization, and this is a good step in the right direction. To the foooooooood! I kept it simple and ordered the 360 with everything on it. It arrived promptly with regular shoestring fries perfectly cooked and NOT over salted. My first bite into this burger was an explosion of salty, savory, and meaty goodness and I didn't get a lot of the pretzel roll. However the second bite gave me the home-run rating that I crave as a foodie. There was a nice 'snap' of the pretzel crust with a fluffy yet chewy roll. They definitely knocked it out of the park with the bun! The ingredients were good, blended well, and none really overpowered the other. I am not sure what kind of onions they use, but they tasted perfect for burgers! Anyway I digress, this was a bit expensive for lunch, my tab being around $10.

I ordered a 1/4 of the hot chicken (white meat) , asparagus, and a bread pudding. Abosolutely fantastic!!! Not only did the chicken look like perfection, but it also taste as such.

However service was outrageously bad. We ordered, my friend got her milkshake like 15-20 mins later. While our server was outside smoking. My other friend got ranch with the chessy fry app, they all seemed to really enjoy the fries. However she never got the ranch until she got her salad. Then server forgot about my friend who asked for worcestershire and A1. She got it roughly 5-8 minutes later. I ordered my sand at awkward time after everyone else ordered, i got it in a timly manner. After she set my sandwich down she never came back to the table. We never got a refill of water, 5/6 of us had water.

"212 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Sometimes I forget just how good Mellow Mushroom's pizza is. But then I just visit again and am reminded of the light yet hearty, perfectly-baked crust that is crisp on the outside and soft and dough-y on the inside, and the generous portions of toppings that just beg the question, ""How did you fit all of this one pizza?"" and the vibrant flavors you can put on your pizza, ranging from a tangy barbecue to a loud feta cheese. Each pizza is, obviously, baked fresh and you can even see them throwing the dough and making the pizza behind the bar. One of my favorites is the Mega Veggie--where else can you get delicious tofu on a pizza AND a vegetarian option that makes it's own flavor statement? Even if you're a carnivore, I think you'd appreciate the ridiculous quantity of vegetables that they fit on the pizza and the way that the flavors just meld together into delicious veggie oblivion. I also like the Funky Q Chicken, Mellow  Mushroom's take on a BBQ Chicken Pizza.  The barbecue sauce is tangy but sweet and extremely satisfying.  Almost makes you want to get up out of your chair and start dancing funk--or maybe that's the hallucinatory drawings on the wall.The decor, as already noted, is...nothing less than trippy.

"212 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Guest and post-travel restaurant of choice for my buddies and I.  I am still not quite sure why.  Perhaps because it serves beer and remains open late.  Mellow Mushroom serves pizza, along with occasional calzones or sandwiches.  The pizzas are strictly traditional American;  thick crust, heavy on the tomato sauce and cheese and loaded with ingredients. They have a nice selection of pizzas, including the classic House Special, Hawaiian, and Mega Meaty, as well as more unique selections such as Mega Veggies, the ""Magical Mystery Tour"" with mushrooms, feta and jalapenos, and the Potato Pie with bacon and potatoes.  All are done reasonably well; the crust is somewhat like an European Bread but usually ends up being too hard, while the dishes are all quite savory, if usually quite heavy with grease as well.  A vegetarian friend of mine especially appreciates the fairly large and varied veggie dishes, including the Teriyaki-grilled tofu hoagie with mushrooms, peppers and sprouts which she orders nearly every single time (I always thought the tofu was too soggy). Mellow Mushroom t has a nice beer list that includes specialty shots, though it (fortunately) lacks much of the shadiness that are usually associated with bar and grills. However, Mellow Mushroom does have the crowding associated with popular bar and grills-if you arrive during meal times without a reservation, be prepared to wait up to an hour. The restaurant goes with a really tacky 1960s psychedelic theme that seems to go over well with some people but not others. Mellow Mushroom isn't cheap, but it is fairly reasonable as a group hangout area.

"212 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"For a long time, I turned up my nose at Mellow Mushroom because of the *ridiculous* psychedelic mushroom theme which is all over the outside and inside of the place. Fortunately, tales of their awesome happy hour forced me to overlook the bad paintings.I am here literally every week. My fellow grad students and I usually come here for happy hour before one of our weekly evening events. We almost always share the Mega Vegetarian, which is quite good. I also quite like the capri sandwich on wheat, as well as the capri appetizer. I've gotten a vegan pizza here before with the Daiya cheese (which I'm convinced the manufacturers named such because it's to die for) and it was really tasty. However, I was disappointed that they only had veggie toppings and no seitan or soyrizo. In response to Marcia M, they almost always have at least plain tofu, because it's one of the main components in the Mega Vegetarian pizza that we get every week. One of the things that I really love about Mellow is that all of their pizza components are flavorful--the dough for the pizza is not bland and the tomato sauce is also good but doesn't overwhelm the pizza. And they are usually generous with their toppings. I know they have pizza by the slice at lunch, but I've never been there early enough to try it. One of the main draws here is their crazy amazing happy hour. Half-priced drafts (a solid selection) from 3-8 M-Th and all day Sunday. Wait-service here is a craps shoot. There's one waitress and one waiter whom I adore and are always on the ball. But almost as often, we get someone who will forget to come back and check on whether we need more drinks or if we're ready for the check. That can be really frustrating when you're on a time crunch especially, which we usually are. Also, once every three times we're here, they are changing out one of the kegs and even though they say it'll be just a minute, one of us ends up waiting an extra 15 minutes for our beer. My advice: if your beer is being swapped, save yourself the trouble and order something else. One other thing I just wanted to let people know about coming with a big group. I tried to arrange a big lunch here for 18 people last month, knowing that they had that back room and that you could reserve it. When I actually tried to do so, there was (I believe) a $50 reservation fee and I was told that the food and drink minimum was $250. The thing is, when you're sharing pizzas, it's not going to cost as much, and if you're coming for lunch, people are probably not going to be ordering drinks.. So I asked if there was any way to reserve one of the side sun-room areas or anything and the response I got was a blanket no. Because of this, we ended up at Pie in the Sky which was very accommodating (though sadly their pizza is not as good).To sum up: the food is good, the drink specials are great, the service is hit or miss. Most days, they're good enough for me to chance it.",Mellow Mushroom,6153420044.0,147.0,2011-04-23,"Louisville, KY",/biz/mellow-mushroom-nashville-3,4.0,157,"Nashville, TN",Amanda A.,36.1622296,-86.774353,38.254237599999996,-85.759407,154.74452749605322,False,2948.0

They really did a great job of decorating the place to whatever this is called. It's nice to see a place really follow through on their intended style. Style is certainly not something these people lack.One of the special things about Mellow Mushroom, aside from their pizza, is their selection of beer. I think the beer menu is at least 4 pages long. It's nice to get a microbrew or something more unusual when you come.The hummus appetizer comes with fresh baked pita. I suppose Middle Easterners might not think it's pita, but whatever it is (perhaps pizza crust) is delicious aht hot and steamy. My favorite pizza is the caesar salad pizza with pesto tofu. It originally comes with pesto chicken, but they're super nice about making substitutions for vegetarians. This pizza comes topped with caesar salad, the ultimate for indecisive diners! But seriously, it's an incredible combination (just a little challenging for reheating leftovers). On the other side of the spectrum, I have gone with meat-loving friends who enjoy the meat-lovers pizza, piled with all sorts... So many flavors, and all are good!I will say, it's not thin-crust pizza, but it is more of a pizza of its own class. Delicious, that's for sure!For a regular sized lunch you can split a small pizza (about $12), to save some money. You can also get half a sandwich/hoagie, which is a pretty good amount. So overall it's not too badly priced if you can arrange it like that.

"212 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I've been to many a Mellow Mushroom in several different states, but the location in Nashville still remains to be my favorite.  I think part of the reason for this is that it is an older location and maintains the charm that Mellow Mushroom used to have.  I've found a lot of their newer locations to be distracting as they are more like entering a hippie theme park than a restaurant (the location in Murfreesboro being a perfect example).The Mellow Mushroom on Broadway has been around for as long as I can remember being in Nashville.  It's probably a safe guess that it was one of, if not the, first locations in Tennessee.  It has one of the most laid back atmospheres I've ever encountered in a Mellow Mushroom.  This is  probably because it is decorated in dark earth tones and has dim lighting, which is a stark contrast to the newer locations that are spattered with bright paint colors and industrial lighting that make them feel sterile and cold.  The building oozes personality and it compliments their menu well.  The kitchen is still open to the dining room area, but it seems a more natural setting and less like an assembly line at the garish theme park locations.There is an open main dining area that occupies the majority of the restaurant, but you can also choose to sit in the large back room or at one of the front tables which look out onto busy 21st avenue.  My favorite place to sit is at the bar because the bartenders are outstanding here.  They're personable and friendly without being fake or pushy and their always helpful in choosing a beer from their extensive selection.  The offer two for ones most days until 7 which makes it a nice place to stop for a drink on the way home from work.  Their menu is just like you'd find at other locations, and I've never had a bad dining experience here.  Everything always comes out just as I ordered and delicious.  My favorites are any of their pesto based pizzas but I love their massive calzones as well.  Their pretzels are amazing if you're looking for an appetizer and I absolutely love their version of the Greek salad.They are located very close to Vanderbilt University which makes them quite popular.  Sometimes the wait for a table can be ridiculous, so I try to only come here during the week or on off times during the weekend.  Parking can also be a pain as they don't actually have a parking lot.  They do offer 'free' valet (they don't charge you but you're still expected to tip) which helps, but I prefer just searching for a spot on the street and walking a few blocks.",Mellow Mushroom,6153420044.0,170.0,2009-01-23,"Nashville, TN",/biz/mellow-mushroom-nashville-3,4.0,157,"Nashville, TN",Courtney B.,36.1622296,-86.774353,36.1622296,-86.774353,0.0,True,2580.0

"700 Main StNashville, TN 37206",4.5,"So I'm originally from Chicago. When I was growing up on Saturday mornings, sometimes my mother and I would go get bagels for breakfast. I grew up always having bagels in the house and when you live in a city like Chicago, it's a way of life really. Well when we moved to Nashville in the mid 90s (if you're from here, you'll know) Nashville had no where to go for bagels. This is something that has slowly developed in this city. I woke up this morning with a hankering for a bagel and knew a place that some friends suggested. I knew they had Lox, and I just couldn't resist making the drive over. The place is a quaint, cool little spot. Bagel options are on display along with spread options (which there are plenty). Solid staples as far as bagels with a few adventurous options. Great spread selection also. I had my mind made up. The Lox on an Everything Bagel. I was definitely not disappointed, as a matter of fact impressed. Lox were perfect (peep their sourcing on the website) not too smokey or that artifical flavor you find in cheap Lox. Bagel was fresh, chewy, and had taste (this is important)!!

A completely unassuming exterior, with only a small sign. Nothing particularly beckoning, but I had heard good things.REALLY nice bagels. They actually have texture and aren't super doughy. Besides the bagel though, I could have made better pretty easily. I had the BLT on an everything bagel with an added egg. The egg and bacon both were clearly reheated and the bacon not at all crispy. They both could have been from Mickey D's and I wouldn't have known the difference. The lettuce was shredded iceberg. I'm not a picky eater, but if I'm busy trying to keep my composure while eating a bagel sandwich the size of my face, I would rather not be trying to contain the escaping shreds while I'm doing it. Give me a simple piece of romaine please! And why add 1/4 cup of cream cheese to the mix??! Every bite was cloyed by the thick creaminess. A light swipe would have been sufficient.The coffee was adequate, but they have nothing more than drip.

Don't let the building (which has a post-apocalyptic aquarium store look to it I cannot adequately describe) or the interior (which is decorated in hipster pseudo-rural funk) fool you, this place makes a mean bagel. They've got the texture nailed perfectly. I'd say it falls between a NY bagel and a Montreal bagel in style. Perfect exterior crunch, interior spongy chewy gluten festival. They are a bit smallish and maybe a little sweeter than a NY style bagel, but only by a small percentage. I tried both the plain and the salted. The plain was excellent and had minimal extraneous flavor, which is a good sign in terms of their cleanliness. A few stray sesame seeds, but nothing serious. The salted was just right. Too many places put waaaaaaay to much salt on a salted bagel. This was just right. They also make all their own cream cheese. I had some smear on one of my plains and it was good, although honestly the cream cheese wouldn't be enough to get me in the door...those bagels would be. The menu looks comprehensive and there are daily changes. They've got sandwiches and other things you can do to your bagel, and some dingy looking seating in sort of a grandma's living room East Nashville hipster dive thing. I don't know. I guess it works. Anyway, this is about the bagels and that's what they do perfectly. I do have one minor quibble. They ask for advanced notice for large orders, but the menu and website are ambitious as to whether this is about the bagels or coffee, or what amount of bagels, etc... Turns out that two dozen plain was the magic number they didn't want to give me. They'd run out they said... Well, the Yankee in me thinks this egalitarianism is very quaint, but bagel stores up north are always first com first served.

I've eaten an incredible amount of bagels in my life and therefore have developed pretty high bagel standards.

It's a bit of a drive from the Vanderbilt area but no distance is too daunting in the search for a great bagel.

These bagels will make your taste buds happy.Upon entering, we were greeted with a warm smile. Kristen was so helpful and patient with me as I decided on what I wanted. The pumpkin cream cheese sounded tasty, but I wasn't sure if that's what I wanted on my bagel. So she allowed me to sample some. How sweet! It was smooth, light and had a lovely fresh pumpkin flavor.Plenty of seating is available and the store is very spacious. The bakery offers a number of flavored bagels daily. Special flavors are offered on a rotating basis. Their daily flavored bagels include Salt, Plain, Sesame, Poppy, Whole Wheat, Everything, Onion, Garlic, Blueberry, and Cinnamon Raisin.Special flavored bagels include Cracked Wheat Jalapeno, Sun-dried Tomato Basil, Potato Dill, Choco Pumpkin, Chocolate Espresso, Cran Pumpkin, Basil Mozzarella, etc. I decided to try the Onion Bagel with Veggie Cream Cheese.

"700 Main StNashville, TN 37206",4.5,"Bagels are certainly one foodstuff that can range from indescribably sublime to unmentionably lousy. Bagel Face's bagels are sublime.I won't try to describe how and why, other than to say it is my understanding Kristen, the proprietor, hunkered down, researched and experimented to make the best bagel going, and her hard work paid off. For people that care about the quality of food at every level - and most importantly about the level right where your taste buds are - these bagels are worth a trip at 7 am. As others have mentioned, BFB bagels are popping up everywhere, but nothing beats rolling up and seeing the BFB crew venting the savory steam with welcoming open doors as the bagels sit still warm in the racks.One great feature of these bagels, in my mind, are the fact that they are on the small side. One of the problems with the way Americans are eating, in the main, is that if three bites of something are good, 18 bites are better. This is wrong. Aside from wearing out your taste buds and other senses, eating Cheesecake Factory-style orders for three served for one is that you can't enjoy a variety of flavors without joining the masses waddling across our great land. While I've gained some weight since I starting copping from BFB at opening time, I've done it with intense pleasure and by eating no fewer than three different bagels during a typical Sunday morning lazy feast over three hours and with a heavy shmear.

"900 Rosa L Parks BlvdNashville, TN 37208",4.0,"It was a cold and cloudy day in December 2013. I had been in Nashville for two years and had given up hope that I would ever have a decent breakfast burrito again. This was a sad reality to face, having spent my 20s in southern California where I was always within walking distance of a delicious breakfast burrito and coffee. After I moved to Nashville, I spent months combing through Yelp and Google, patiently seeking my BB fix -- but somehow I missed this place, which is located inside the Farmer's Market downtown. I was willing to go breakfast burrito-less if it meant living in a city I adored, but I'd be lying if I said my heart didn't break a little bit each Sunday (BB day in my book). And then, like a lightning bolt from the heavens, one day in December 2013, I somehow entered just the right combination of search terms on Yelp, or perhaps the Nashville gods had decided it was time to reward my efforts, but there it was: a review about this place and its breakfast burritos. I was headed downtown faster than a toupee in a hurricane. Oh, what a glorious day when I first tasted El Burrito Mexicano's veggie breakfast burrito: eggs, cheese, potatoes, freshly-chopped jalapenos, peppers, onions, and a little bit of magic. And then their red taco sauce -- be still, my heart! In that moment, I knew I would never have to leave this town, because it had everything I needed.There is nothing more rewarding than finding the thing you were searching for after a long and perilous journey.

My biggest disappointment is with the line dancing teacher/host who we have seen on both nights visiting this venue. She says ""y'all"" every two words and it was almost enough to drive my group out of here. Seriously- if you're speaking to a room full of people, have some public speaking skills or at least self awareness. One of the many line dances that were taught were fun/difficult and the rest were super easy. Boring! On songs which we recognized as being line dancing songs, the ""leader"" was either absent, or leading a super simplified version that we yawned at. I understand there are a bunch of tourists and beginners, but it'd be fun to be a bit more challenged. Maybe have two sections going on- one easy and one complex, like on copperhead road, for example. Also, her complete absence during plenty of songs was a hindrance to us because we ""know"" the dances with a little bit of a refresher. The place closed early on Thursday, our first night trying it out, due to lack of activity. I think there would be PLENTY more activity if they were more in touch with what the crowd wants, because whenever dances are being done with ""y'all"" girl, the people flocked to the dance floor. On my second night, I ordered wings and they sucked. Also, the bartender was incredibly rude after he ran off with my order and then came back to confirm my name and I mentioned I had a tab. He had an attitude and then slammed down my bottle and stalked off. I guess I need to be familiar with the order I need to disseminate information here. He was short and was probably having a complex since I'm a tall, strong woman.  He was rude to my friend separately as well, and got her order wrong twice. He didn't want to fix the mistaken order but luckily someone else stepped in.  (Taller shaggy looking bartender was fine and recalled my name for the tab.One more weird thing was that there must have been a company event ""iPass"" and without any warning, about 12 suits took the stage and gave some speeches. It was very bizarre and ended with a brief motivational monologue about the potential future success of their business.

"120 Second Ave NNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"A couple of our friends who had been to Nashville suggested this place for line dancing. It seems like a moderately local spot to go to, which was definitely a plus when we were looking for things to do. When a band isn't playing, a lead dancer goes on the stage and teaches you the moves for the dance. You learn together in a group and then the music plays for you to practice, before the entire song plays. At first, my friends and I were intimidated, but in truly Southern style, a couple of the locals chatted us up and convinced us to go up there. In our group of 3, there was 1 guy and he was truly impressed with how many girls were up there dancing. It was overwhelmingly female and fun for all.We didn't get any food, but had a few drinks which were average and nothing special. But we didn't come for the food!

"120 Second Ave NNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"My boyfriend and I came here recently when vacationing in Nashville from New Jersey. In general I had just an OKAY experience here. Definitely a tourist trap but worth going to at least once. The decor is pretty awsome! Tons of different funny horses are spread throughout the entire place. Great for taking tons of funny pictures. I wanted to order the Comfortly Jack to drink and wanted it without the souiveniere glass. However, to my dissappntment the waitress told me I cold not purchase just the drink without getting the glass as well, refills are less money if you do decide to get it. I caved because I really wanted the drink itself. It cost me $13.75 for it. Grantit the glass was nice but I didn't want it and the ""signature drink"" was to very good. There is a problem when the drink is huge and you barley have a buzz by the time it's done. My boyfriend just ordered a beer and that too was its a purchase of a souiveniere glass. I get the whole up selling customer thing but to make a costumer get one of those glasses is just stupid if they don't want it. We split two different things, one was the sampler. It came with quesadillas, chicken fingers, fried green tomatoes and fried pickles. My bf hates is allergic to pickles and told the waitress so she added extra chicken fingers with o extra price that was very nice of her. The green tomatoes were soooooooo good! Absolutely loved ! And the chicken fingers were prob the best chicken fingers I have ever had! The quesadilla was just okayyy. We then decided to split the Tennessee BBQ duo . The waitress tried to change our mind and up sell us to the priciest item on their menu the ""Stampede Platter"" ($23.00)  after we already made up our mind and kept asking if we were sure. Yes lady we are sure! Especially due to the fact that both menu items were the exact same thing but the Platter was slightly bigger. The Duo (17.00)  came with hickory smoked pork chops and shaved beef brisket. Baked beans co slaw and Texas toast. The baked beans were amazing but the rest of the meal was pretty bland. They had containers of BBQ on the table to add to the meal. I must say while being in Tennesee I had better dinners during my stay here. After dinner we decided to go upstairs and check out the pool tales and air hockey tales. The pool tales were very cheap and not good if your a pool player. The hockey tables were also cheap but fun. Both were free which was great and they had a lot of them. Overall my experience here was just okay like I said.

You can see everyone on the floor having a good time and have a great view of the band as well. Eat dinner on the main floor and move up to the 2nd floor. The staff is super friendly and helpful in anyway they can be. The horses are great photo props! The BBQ sauce is amazing! (Even sold in the retail store). You can request songs to be played by both the dj and the band. Their specialty cocktails are great. Cowboy margarita- a margarita made with moonshine instead of tequila, then they also have a 'hoe down throw down' it's an Arnold Palmer with sweet tea moonshine. Sooooo refreshing.

"120 Second Ave NNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"I made the trip up from Atlanta to catch the Summerland tour, and was pleasantly surprised by this place.  It has a nicely laid out floor plan, with a lot of seating on three floors of space, all with a decent view of the raised stage.  A medium sized venue nestled in the midst of 2nd avenue on Nashville, a popular street for nightlife, one can catch a variety of acts here, and have a decent dinner to boot.  And if you love the place enough, there's no shortage of memorabilia you can take home from the gift shop.The saloon has a deal with local Blackstone brewery, and they carry some of the local brews, including one beer brewed specifically for this place.  A number of signature cocktails can be ordered as well, either by themselves or, for the touristy souvenir, in trademarked take home glasses.  Drink prices were average, with lots of bar space for those inclined to belly up.  The selection of other brews was a bit light, but I'd rather try something local, so I was happy.The fare is that of the traditional American bar and grill.  I tried the chargrilled chicken sandwich, which is served with a ranch sauce well infused with avocado.  The chicken was decent, on the dry side, but the aforementioned sauce was very good.  All of the sandwiches come with fries, and these were crispy without being thin, and had an excellent flavor.  I've been trying to dial down on cheese lately, so I chose this one, but many of the other entrees were tempting, including a burger with jalapenos in a jalapeno sauce with a jalapeno infused cheese.  OK, now that I typed it, I think I should have ordered it...When I entered, to be honest, I did not expect much from the sound system.  Much to my surprise, the acoustics of the place were quite good, and the sound man was on last night.  Vocals were crisp and clear, while the rock was loud without being overpowering.  My table was fairly close to the stage, but wandering around, it seemed to me the sound was excellent pretty much everywhere.  For the number of tables they have, a veritable legion of wait staff can be seen flitting about the restaurant.  My waiter was great, with a good knowledge of the menu, and plentiful refilling of waters and soft drinks, and regularly checking on alcoholic beverage desires from those drinking.  He was personable and professional, and in hindsight I should have tipped him more for waiting on me for 5 hours during the concert.  At one point he even brought me a drink I ordered to where I was on the dance floor.Overall, the Wildhorse was a very nice experience for me.  Is it a bit touristy?  Yes.  More than a bit.  But the food was decent, local beers were available, good service was to be had, and good music could be heard well.  Oh, and unbelievably, they actually serve Diet Mountain Dew, a great rarety and my soft drink of choice.  The only real detractor, and I'm nitpicking perhaps, were the restrooms.  In a venue this size, it would be a struggle to keep them respectable, but nevertheless, by the end of the night it was not great.  Also, the women's room needs expansion, as there was quite the line for what I am told were only a few stalls.  But venue restrooms are never acceptable, so don't let that scare you off from trying a show here.  And maybe take a picture with the titular Wildhorse statue!",Wildhorse Saloon,6159028200.0,56.0,2013-07-17,"Roswell, GA",/biz/wildhorse-saloon-nashville,4.0,246,"Nashville, TN",William G.,36.1622296,-86.774353,34.02332,-84.360022,201.11629337852975,False,3350.0

"120 Second Ave NNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"The Wildhorse Saloon is an awesome venue to see entertainment. I recommend this place for music when you can catch a really good act because the building itself is set up well for shows.Our experience was just so-so (Monday night and all). The performer Larry Frick and his band was good, but played covers for the simple minds...our simple minds enjoyed some of it just fine. There was a lot of stretching of time by the band, some silly dance contests for tee shirts etc. and the required birthday song for a few people in the audience. If you enjoy the silly concept of line dancing (think ""a country version of the electric slide"", also an embarrassingly corny activity), this place is for you. They even have an on-staff dance coach to help the people that like corny stuff (no self respecting real man would do this in public). Good fun for those types of folks.This is definitely a Tourist trap...but then again, Nashville is a street carnival mask on an entire town designed to fleece people and liberate you of your money.The best fun I had in Nashville was listening to some of the street performers and talking to the homeless and desperate trying to win a buck from you. I gave money to several needy folks and aspiring musicians...that was the best money I spent all night.So, the Widlhorse food. An Executive Chef? That is funny! Some reviewers compared the food to the handful of American restaurant chains out there. I say those chains make better food.The ""world famous fried pickles"" came to our table warm, not hot, and were immediately chilled by the blasting AC vent we were under. They were edible, but barely tasted of pickle. The breading was OK but tasted too much of the oil.We ordered the BBQ sampler between us two (the server had explained that they were famous for the BBQ). The ribs were good, the chopped pork was fair and the brisket tasted foul, I could not eat it and this was what I was looking forward to.The three sauces they offered were weird. A sweet unremarkable sauce, a ""vinegar sauce"" that was really a mustard based sauce and a ""hot sauce"" that was not hot and had a foreign flavor I could not wrap my head around. None of them went well with any of the BBQ products on the plate.My wife said the black beans and coleslaw sides were fairly good. I did not eat them.The Wildhorse draft beer is good, I enjoyed it probably the most of anything about our experience here. The margaritas were not good, but almost no one makes a good margarita so no surprise. Most people actually have zero concept of what makes a good margarita so places like this sell them easily. We had no other types of drinks here (except a rail whisky before I left, but you cant screw that up).Cover charge was 6 bucks, children 10 or 12. Come on folks, the world does not revolve around your children. These places make money on alcohol; your children hopefully do not drink. Common sense tells you why the cover. Take your kids to Opry...this is a music bar club...and town. Our server was good. Once he knew we weren't your typical tourists looking to pinch a penny at every turn he was our best friend. I gave him a $20 tip on an $87 tab and he shook my hand. Like the struggling people on the street...this was good money spent; servers in towns like this deal with some pretty stupid people and deserve to have a good night once on a while.Wildhorse? Yep, great place for music. But also a corny tourist joint for people that like that stuff. I wish we had gotten a bite to eat elsewhere and bar hopped all night, there were no covers in most of the clubs that night and they were begging for customers this Monday night. I would go to the Wildhorse for a show if we were in town when someone really good is plating there...but eat elsewhere and order beer or simple basic cocktails.FYI folks, you do not have to order the beer in a souvenir glass, you can order pints.

If you want a souvenir glass, the drink menu is perfect for you, otherwise order the basics because specialty drinks are usually weak and overpriced almost everywhere...that silly little umbrella or garnish costs you a bunch!",Wildhorse Saloon,6159028200.0,58.0,2013-10-14,"Troy, VA",/biz/wildhorse-saloon-nashville,3.0,246,"Nashville, TN",Kenny D.,36.1622296,-86.774353,37.95097370000001,-78.2463934,486.99578884512755,False,4217.0

KEEP READING.... If you want to go see a decent selection of live music, this is another venue that fits that mark. Yes, in Nashville there are probably hundreds of places to see live music. But are they all that large format concert experience? I don't think so. The Club: Large format. Three stories. Several bars to keep you happy. The Food: Skip it. They claim to have award winning BBQ. They must have made up that award. If you think their BBQ is good, you probably haven't had anything else. The Bar/Drinks: Typical full bar. Several on tap beer selections but nothing spectacular. If you want hard alcohol you can get that too. Just be prepared to pay for it. Tips: Don't waste your money for a floor seat. Go with the second or third floor balconies and save yourself some money. Get there early if it is someone you really want to see. If you are not with a group, and show up ""late,"" you are going to have the lovely experience of standing outside to get in. THEY LET GROUPS IN FIRST!

One of us ordered the shrimp and grits and though it seemed like a small portion, it was very filling and very scrumptious; we shared everything at the table with each other.  I ordered the basil grit cakes as an appetizer and that was a real treat!   I did not know what to expect but the service and the fare hit one out of the park last night.  It just happened to be my birthday and my wife casually mentioned the ""birthday boy"" in a brief chat while the waitress was checking in on us.  No big fuss was made about it.  The waitress brought a surprise after dinner in the form of a huge rectangular plate, decorated with chocolate scripted ""Happy Birthday,"" written beneath a huge slice of awesome MUD CAKE!  They did not sing or make a scene but that cake was amazing!  Nice treat!We watched the paddle boarders traveling around the marina waters (you can rent them there and they are one of the many goings and comings we saw from the docks).

"4550 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"I love the salads at Newk's. They're tossed in the dressing and they're HUGE! Definitely enough for 2. The staff are friendly and greet you when you come in the door. I was excited about the Lobster Bisque, but when I tried it, I found it to be extremely salty. This was true for the Ultimate Crab soup as well, so that leads me to believe that all of their soup is over salted. The soup pricing is a bit on the expensive side for what you you get in my opinion. The drink cups are large and they have free refills, but if you don't drink soda or tea when you eat, and you ask for a water cup, they give you a very small cup (about 6oz I think). I'd much rather pay 25 cents for a larger water cup than have to constantly get up for a refill. The only complaint I have about the salads is that someone in the kitchen needs to be retrained about how far down you can cut romaine without ruining it. I've often gotten salads full of lettuce ribs, which in case you've never bitten into one by accident, are extremely bitter. So note to Newks prep staff, the white part of the romaine is for throwing away, not serving! Parking can be a bit of a hassle during high volume times. Overall Newk's gets a green light from me.Update:After a getting a particularly bad salad with lots of lettuce ""ribs"" for a takeout order I picked up one evening shortly before they closed, I decided to call and speak to a manager (Matthew) the next day. AMAZING. He took time to listen to me, and we had a conversation about how he tries to help the staff (most of whom appear to be fairly young) have a sense of pride and accomplishment in the work they do. It was so evident that he truly cares about his staff, and about the reputation of the restaurant. He also went above and beyond to correct the bad experience I'd had the night before.

Som tum (papaya Thai style, ordered crazy ho)t, pork satay, fried chicken wings. (If they give you a choice between Thai and Lao style, consider that Lao style will come with fermented fish and/or fermented rice paddy crabs--woof--I grew up with this stuff and it brings on the funk--so, not for the faint of heart--but I did feel a little swell of pride that these folks are keeping up the native way of making this green papaya dish.)The Lard Na was watery and oddly a little bland--the gravy should be thick and a bit gooey. The seafood - not so fresh. Adding a bit of sugar, hot pepper, and fish sauce help but it is missing the body and unctuous mouth feel I expected from this dish.  The Gwaey theow--noodle soup was pretty good. The broth was pretty good with interesting depth. I ordered pork and expected minced pork which is more the norm but it came with slim chunks of pork -- okay overall. Cilantro and mung bean sprouts thrown in and no basil that you would get with a bowl of pho. The green curry was just too sweet for me and far sweeter than what you would get in Thailand.

Some ladies like it salty, others more spicy, etc. I prefer it when the owner cooks my food, but what can you do. She's usually manning the cash register. So it is a bit inconsistent at times. Dining in is usually a safer bet. This is a great place to chow down on the cheap, but you have to know what to order. Anything thai is delicious, especially if you ask for it ""Thai-style.""

(And again, and again...)Let's start with the food; I thoroughly enjoyed the rack of lamb with fig reduction, roasted Brussels sprouts and fingerling potatoes. Hubby had the ribeye with some amazing blue-cheese sauce, truffled mashed potatoes and wilted greens (that we couldn't identify and forgot to ask...but enjoyed nonetheless). Both dishes were perfectly cooked, tender and delicious. Biggest compliment of the food; my husband, who is not a fan of lamb, tasted it, loved it and claimed he would order it next time we come in. Wow! Thanks to our server, Brian, for the recommendation. Dessert was unreal. Salted caramel and chocolate mousse cake-like thingamajig with a cherry sauce. I was seriously tempted to pick up the plate and lick it clean. Now for the service; In my opinion, the measure of good customer service is how they respond to unpredictable circumstances. If you know me, you know that there is usually some adventure or disaster waiting to occur. This night was no exception.Lately it seems I can't choose a restaurant that doesn't love cooking with avocado. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the taste, but over the past 20 years I've developed an allergy to this sneaky little superfood. We ordered a Caesar salad made with shaved Brussels sprouts instead of romaine. It was absolutely delicious but also contained chunks of avocado and, it turns out, a bit of avocado mixed into the dressing. I only had a couple of bites before I noticed and immediately dosed up on Benadryl and Ibuprofen. The staff quickly whipped up a new salad for me. The head chef was not working last night but happened to be there with some friends. He took the time to come over and chat with us and see how we were doing. That was above and beyond nice. First, it was NOT their fault in any way. I know to mention my dumb allergy and simply forgot. Second, their response was swift and respectful. They have a terrific group of professionals here. I was able to finish my meal with nothing more than some stuffiness and puffiness. By dessert I looked like a trout (mouth breathing and fat lips) but I wasn't about to miss out!

Though I made a Saturday reservation (easy to get by phone at 7 p.m.) based on a halibut entree on their website menu, it wasn't on their menu when we arrived. That could have tipped the scale for me, but there was another option this night, a special: Chilean sea bass.Now, we all know there's no such thing as Chilean sea bass, but whose mouth waters at the utterance of Patagonian toothfish? Doesn't matter to me; I'm along for the ride, and Bound'ry's sea bass was delicious: fresh, melty and perfectly seasoned. I lapped up the sauce in as reserved a manner as I could muster and practically hummed while gobbling the crab-stuffed shrimp. I cleaned my plate while feeling full but not stuffed. Win.Two things, though:1) The server didn't card my husband or me when we ordered alcohol, and I didn't have an ID on me. I was glad to enjoy my drink regardless, but it doesn't look good to me when my ID isn't requested. I'm in my 20s, so it isn't attributed to vanity; it's due to being a stickler for the rules.2) This was a date for me and my husband, and we were seated in a booth (yuck) in a room with the loudest table in the restaurant: six people celebrating someone's birthday. The loudly sang and guffawed throughout the meal -- they had finished eating when we sat down and were still laughing through drinks when we left -- and my husband and I had to lean across our table to hear each other. I was a bit bummed by this thoughtless arrangement.

Went with the waiter's very high recommendation for the Ring of Fire pizza (as I am a huge spicy food fan) but the ridiculous amount of spice on the pizza covered all the flavor of the other ingredients. Also, with most the entrees being reasonably priced in the mid $20 range, I felt it was a inappropriate for most of their wines to be in the $50+ range.

"911 20th Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"CORRECTION.. ZERO STARS!  This is BY FAR one of the worst experiences Ive ever had at a restaurant. DONT GO HERE!   It would be one thing if they were just having a bad day, but this was not the case. Our problems were with their polices, lying, portion sizes, and lack of proper management. We are in the food industry and know whats right and whats wrong, BOUND'RY IS SOO WRONG. Read on...A few friends and I stopped in for dinner a few weeks ago. This is what went down.I had a steak and a side which was about $40. The steak was about 2"" in diameter and the side was about the same size. It was also not hot, not cold.. but not hot at all. Seemed to be sitting before it got to me. Tasty.. but not for $40.  One friend had the falafel dinner. This was very tiny as well. Shes a tiny person so a small meal is fine, but this was really tiny. The falafel was soo salty my friend couldnt eat it. They also put a bunch of tomatoes on her plate to make it look like there was more food and more than half of them were rotten. YES, ROTTEN TOMATOES.  She sent it back, there were no apologies, the waitress just took it away.When we sat down the waitress suggested the Arugula dinner salad to my other friend. She said she always suggests it and raved about it. So my friend ordered it with grilled chicken on top (an extra $6), which made the salad a total of $17. She was fine with that because she figured it was a dinner salad. WRONG. This salad came on a side dish plate (no joke). It had a thin layer of arugula 3 small pieces/chunks (exactly) of crumbled goat cheese and the chicken on top. needless to say we were really upset.  When the waitress came over to ask about the food my ""Salad friend"" said how disappointed she was in the size. The menu said dinner salad and this was clearly on a side plate (like small bread plate. I AM NOT EVEN EXAGGERATING).  The waitress said OK and went into the kitchen. She came back to tell us that the chef said thats the size of the salad and there wasnt anything she could do. Then she proceeded to LIE TO OUR FACES. She said, ""I really try to steer people away from it.""  Wait.. what?  You just raved about it and suggested it when we walked in.When the check came and we were faced with the reality of the $17 salad, I got the manager.  At that point, we had been there for a long time and just wanted to leave. I wanted him to take the salad off the bill. ""Salad Friend"" said she would pay for the chicken because she accepted the $6 charge early on, but she felt she was tricked into getting the salad and then lied to. So the manager took the bill to ""correct"" it, dropped it off and then scurried away.  HE TOOK $4 OFF THE BILL.

The medium-rare ostrich filet was tasty but a bit cool on arrival. I chased it down with a Sonoma chardonnay and called it a night with a s'mores dessert.

"911 20th Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"Bound'ry, I have fallen in love with you. But my experience is a little different from the average, so this review may be biased in a way. This was the location of the entire reason my dad and I went to Nashville. He was booked to play a show with some of his friends for an old high school buddy of his.  His buddy was having a company retreat in Nashville and this was the weekend cap on all of the fun and excitement. The show was on the third level, where the big banquet room and stage is located. That part of the experience was fantastic. The room was decorated perfectly and it was a really cozy atmosphere that played well with the performance and vibe of the whole event.We went down to the second level and ate our meal before the show, which was the same as what was catered to the guests. The salad was fantastic, with candied prosciutto and walnuts; the steak and truffle mashed potatoes with asparagus melted in my mouth and I almost cried from excitement (we were staying in Loew's Vanderbilt and I was being taunted by an advertisement for Ruth's Chris Steak House for days at this point); the tiny little bite sized desserts weren't super special, but there was nothing wrong with them either. This is the part of my review that I feel might be different from others because I didn't see a normal menu and this was entirely paid for/part of a planned large-scale dinner. After dinner and before my dad played, we went down to the snazzy little cocktail bar downstairs. THIS is what I loved so much. While the food was mouth-watering, delicious and heavenly, the dirty martinis I had were moan-inducing. They were absolutely delicious and exactly how I like them! I really wish Nashville wasn't a 10 hour drive for me or I'd be here snagging a tasty cocktail much more often.

"911 20th Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"After reading reviews here at yelp and then getting numerous recommendations from friends about Boundary on the fantastic service and pretty good food , I was excited to take my wife and some friends here last Saturday.I have never been more disappointed by a restaurant. It wasn't one big thing necessarily, but just a number of small things that added up combined with how much people had built the place up.We arrive and are told it will be about an hour to be seated and take a 'buzzer'  and sit upstairs at a table in the bar. There is a bar tender and server along with one other person. After initially being greeted by the server, it takes her 15 minutes to come back and take our drink order. The drinks were fantastic, except for the part that it took another 15 minutes to get them and they forgot one. 5 Minutes later, and 35 total minutes from being greeted, our drink order is filled.In the meantime, it is approximately 45 degrees outside and they feel the need to have two of their huge windows opened completely. All of us are freezing and upon request of closing the windows, the server appeared annoyed as hell that we would request something so insane. She closed one window.At this point, our server tells us that it would probably be better to order food from the bar, we take her advice for some reason, and are given ONE menu for all of us to share. She finally comes back after us being there an hour to take are order and the crab cake appetizers arrive. I understand that eating at a nicer restaurant, the portion sizes are going to be vastly smaller as they use finer quality ingredients and professional chefs prepare them; however when the entire appetizer can fit on a single table spoon, you've got to be kidding me.Now our food is finally arriving and the waitress still hasn't cleared off our empty drink glasses or the buzzer from earlier. We end up having to clear the table ourselves and put the items on another table. As the food is being given to us, they repeatedly mixed up who got what.Now the food was pretty good. The only complaint is that the 6oz steak was at most 4oz. It tasted great, but I don't see the point in saying it is 6oz.  Also, my friend got the LBT Pizza, and each slice literally had an inch thick tomato slice on it...seriouslyIn the end, we got pretty good food but with service worse than a Krystal's at 4am on a Friday night in Antioch.That reminds me. About halfway through our dinner, the bar got packed with a number of 'street' people (hood/ghetto) that I have no clue how were even allowed in.So it wasn't one big thing, just a ton of small things. Not impressed at all. Honestly, the next day we went to Logans and had better food and better service for a fifth the price.",Bound’ry Restaurant - Temp.

When she did return, she clearly lacked knowledge of the menu (she named an entree as an appetizer and was unsure if a certain entree's meat was bone-in) and rushed to take our food orders, omitting beverages completely - we had to remind her that yes, we drink more than just water at 8:30pm on a Saturday. After repeated ""check-ins"" during our meal (yes, we're still doing okay), she cleared our plates and let us sit for 10 minutes waiting on the check before she silently set a book in front of each of us. We opened them to review our checks but found dessert menus instead! Again we waited for the waitress to come back so we could exchange the dessert menus for checks... yet she returned with a single check that we had to again ask her to split.The food may have partially redeemed the experience, but although it was delivered promptly and presented well, and although the textures and flavor combinations were creative, it really lacked that extra ""wow"" factor captured by great restaurants. I am by no means a food snob (I'll eat anything), but if I am going to pay $31 for a 4-inch lobster tail, it better knock my socks off. After hearing all the hype surrounding Boundry, I expected a lot more.I am sure that our service experience was incidental considering the friendliness and competence of the rest of Boundry's staff.

"911 20th Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"I've eaten here twice now. Once my husband and I sat at the bar for a quick dinner, and another time I went with a large group and we had a separate room. Dinner with my husband (four stars): We stopped here on our way to a birthday dinner at another restaurant in town that doesn't have gluten free options. My husband and I were the only two bellied up to the bar and we had great service. I explained 1) my gluten allergy, and 2) my love affair with shrimp and grits. I was so hoping I could have the shrimp and grits! The bartender found a waiter who worked there and had a gluten allergy. He came over to me and told me the chef would have to modify the shrimp and grits slightly to make them gf. Yay! The food arrived promptly and it was delicious. I was thankful they went out of their way to ensure I had a gluten free dinner and will definitely come here again (not in a large group - see below). Group dinner (one star): Well, I know it's a challenge to make good food for a large group so I won't be too hard on them. But overall I was very disappointed. My expectations were high after having had a good dinner here with my husband. Everyone was served a Caesar salad and we had a choice of entree. I had a filet with mashed potatoes and a vegetable medley. The salad was just okay. You might be able to make a better one at home yourself. When the filet arrived I cut into it immediately to check how it was cooked. I ordered medium and it was well done. Not a speck of pink in the center. Um, not okay. I called the server over and asked for a new filet cooked medium. I wasn't the only one - two other people at my table got well done filets and had ordered medium rare and medium - but they ate theirs. He brought a new filet, cooked correctly, back on my old plate. Disgusting. And so was the filet. Disgusting, that is. It's definitely not their forte. It had no flavor whatsoever. And the rest of the stuff on my plate was bland. For dessert everyone got a weird plate of cookies. It must not have been good because it was hardly touched. They brought be berries in cream because I needed a gluten free option. Several people commented that they should have said they needed gluten free, too! And they should have - my dessert was good.

They are stingy with said meat and cheese, so I think I prefer the original incarnation at $3 less a pop. However, I was pleased to see the menu options have been narrowed (still tapas and entrees available), since the Boundry once suffered from Too Many Choices Syndrome.

I ended up getting some steamed dumplings and fried rice, nothing too special but let me tell you it was delish!

On my second visit I ended up trying the sushi. I'm not a big fan of sushi but our rolls were made to order. The rolls were super fresh and light something that is essential for me when I eat sushi.

This time around, we came for dinner too. We walked in and found a spot to sit, and our server came right over and asked if we wanted some drinks. We ordered bushwhackers, which were really good, but from the second he walked away, we joked that he didn't seem to ""like"" us. We were all sober and not loud or annoying.

How could you come into a restaurant and leave that little of a tip?"" So I said ""first of all, that taking a picture thing aside, this whole experience was awkward and rude. Secondly, I don't think she realized she didn't leave you 15% because we even discussed that we were going to leave you 15%. I'm sorry that happened but this was just rude.""

No complaints here.) I asked our waiter what their specialty was. What do the locals come there to eat? He immediately responded that their brisket sandwiches are really good. So, on that suggestion I ordered one, and so did 6 out of 8 of us. It. Was. uh-freaking-mazing! I am originally from Texas and I now live in the ""dirty south"". I've had brisket a time or two. It is very easy to let it get dry and tough. Not this brisket. It had the texture and tenderness of a good thickly sliced corned beef yet retained the smokey ""earthen""ness of a good smoked brisket. This, coupled with cheese and peppers and onions, on buttery Texas toast made for an unbelievable sandwich. Oh, and the beer! I ordered a Yazoo Hefeweizen because I saw that it was brewed in Nashville and I like trying local flavors and I've had hefeweizens before and know that I generally enjoy them.

School was hard and drinks were necessary. When they arrived, they found a cozy patio with twinkling white lights, pretty blue chairs, and mason jars aglow with tea lights. The margaritas in this magical place made them wonder if they'd floated away to NeverNeverLand! The queso too was a dream. So every week, they returned and returned for the happiest of hours spent on the patio with friends. And never did this place disappoint. One day they realized they could order margaritas by the pitcher! (thus saving precious coins) and a lovely man named Jimbo never let them down in his mixing. The tacos were a wonder too. The fish was so good, and the lobster specials incomparable. Even the fresh veggie side sprinkled with queso fresca didn't disappoint. They were even willing to appease some of the people who had strange requests, like selling a single avocado. As time wore on, the taco sizes got bigger! This pleased the poor grad students and made their bellies happy.

The fish taco was by far my favorite and I would come back for that anytime, especially with their boom boom (habanero) sauce which is not really that spicy. My sister had a veggie taco and cheese enchilada (wasn't a fan of the enchilada). Overall, the food is fine. It's not the best taco's I've ever had and they certainly aren't the worst.

They do have a lunch special with 2 tacos and a side which is a decent deal, but I personally find it to be insufficiently filling and need an additional taco and then a drink, so it basically ends up being 14-15 dollars at that point. I could get a much nicer meal than that at a much nicer restaurant. My boyfriend and I just had lunch there and it was seriously $30. FOR LUNCH! AT A TACO PLACE! We should have just gone to J. Alexander's or something and had a much nicer, larger and filling meal.The food is decent, some of their specials are especially good.

"4501 Murphy RdNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"Went here for a birthday lunch with my husband during the week because I wanted to play with puppies at Love at First Sight which is just a few doors down from The Local Taco. I was a bit nervous because I had heard mixed reviews, but I always like to try new things.Walking up to the screened-in patio, I was assaulted by smells that truly made my mouth water and my tummy grumble. I loved the relaxed shabby-chic vibe when we walked in, and while I could see how this place could get crowded during busy hours, there were still plenty of tables available to us. My husband got the taco lunch basket with one Korean BBQ taco and one Local BBQ taco. I got the lobster enchiladas (the daily special) and a cup of the tomato-corn soup. We placed our orders then went and claimed our tables and waited for our food to arrive.On first appearance, I completely saw what others meant when they said that the portions seem a tad on the skimpy side. I was particularly disappointed that my lobster enchiladaS actually wound up being a single enchilada that was pretty skinny (it looked more like a flauta). Based on how the dish had been described on the board (and that pesky ""S"" on the end), I expected to get at least two enchiladas for $5 or at the least, one rather fat one. That said, the enchilada was REALLY good - you could taste the lobster, and it was covered in this delightfully creamy sauce that had a nice citrus zing to it. And the cup of soup? I could have easily eaten a bowl, or a barrel, of it, because it was divine and I am not usually one to order soup. My husband's tacos were both quite good, nice and fresh tasting, though he would have liked it if the tortillas had been warmed. Additionally, he thought the salsa that accompanied his chips was weird, but I liked its smoky, vaguely Asian flavor and I can honestly say that I have never had another salsa like it.Our mains were so good that we decided to share an order of flan and  that was a great choice too. Nice and creamy with lots of flavor, and I appreciated that they tried to spruce up the plating to elevate the dish.All in all, I see how people might argue that the prices are a little steep here, but I have to say that the food was really tasty and I actually felt pleasantly full after I had finished my meal (even before the flan). I know this place often gets compared to Taco Mamacita, and I definitely prefer The Local Taco. It doesn't have that chain feel to it, perhaps because of its slightly smaller setting, and the food just tastes fresher and more inspired. I'd rather have slightly smaller portions of food that tastes really good than lots of something that's bland or heavy.

We ordered the Indonesian peanut sauté & the pad Thai, both regular sizes & with chicken. We also ordered some pot stickers. The cashier was more focused on what was going on with the other employee & she kept having to ask ""what"" to us. Once we finally got our order in, we sat down at a booth.

Both pasta dishes were hot (temperature wise) but the pot stickers we cold. Also, I've never seen pot stickers that are smashed so flat, almost like little quesadillas. The stuffing inside wasn't good. I was really disappointment with them. The Indonesian peanut sauté was good. It has two heat icons on the menu but I didn't find it spicy at all.  I would've liked a little more heat.

Most of my wife's favorite foods involve noodles in some way or another, so she was very excited about coming.I came in without preconceived notions, avoiding even reading Yelp before my visit. Visiting on a Sunday around 2:00 pm, my wife and I were both thoroughly underwhelmed by our experience.First, the service had issues. I was ignored by the counter person for a couple of minutes, although he may have assumed we were still making selections. I picked a table for my wife and I and then went to fill my drink at the fountain. While I was filling my drink, my feet were attacked by a carpet-sweeper wielding employee. I moved out of her way and she quickly jumped in front of me, between me and the table, and proceeded to take a very long time to figure out that a carpet sweeper doesn't work very well on a tile floor. I waited patiently for her to finish, which she finally did, after three minutes of me standing waiting for her to let me return to my table. She did not acknowledge my presence at any point during this exchange, even after she ran over my toes. I guess it was my bad for wearing flip-flops.The food was nearly as disappointing as the service. My wife's Mac and Cheese was, as Jason S. noted, no better than Kraft, and my Indonesian peanut saute with chicken was an exercise in bland laziness. As an example, the cilantro on top was an entire sprig, I had to pick the leaves off myself. We both had to thoroughly mix our dishes when they arrived at the table, the sauce was quite unevenly applied. The chicken and meatballs were both obviously cooked from frozen. The chicken had that hard, cracked leather outside and dry, chalk-like inside that comes from being unevenly cooked. Even our side Caesar salads were a disappointment. The cheese was some processed blend, not real Parmesan or whatever they claimed it to be. The romaine lettuce was mainly the tough, outer leaves and they were even wilted.
