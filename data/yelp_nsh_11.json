Simply sip on it, type away using BJE's free wifi and think about all the things the day has to offer.

I have been to Bongo Java at least 10 times in the past two years.In the early days, I found Bongo Java's brewed coffee to be very nice and their espresso drinks to be among the best in Nashville - as far as I knew at the time - but still a notch or two lower than what I was used to. While I eventually checked out still more places, I kept going back to Bongo Java, but over time I noted a gradual decrease in quality, which may be attributable to the beans.In fact, in late 2014 I bought a bag of beans to grind and brew at home, either on the Bonavita or the Technivorm. I was put off by the labeling of \"medium roast\" on the bag. I guess I never noticed that before, because I went there for espresso drinks. That sort of categorization or labeling caused me to shake my head; it told me something new about them and how they view their customers.Yes, rather than presume that their customers are intelligent, they dumbed-down their labeling. I would rather see a general description or summary of the flavor profile on the bag, describing the end result of that crop of that bean, as they saw fit to roast it. If they did want to note the level of roast - which has little to no relevance when the profile is accurately described for consumers - they should use more universal terms to describe roast development. Again, I would rather see such things removed.Anyway, about that \"medium\" roast - whatever that means. I would have called it more of a \"full city\" roast: not far enough from \"second crack\" territory for my taste. If I want more smoke on the beans, I'd go to Charbucks, but I don't. I may as well go to McDonald's for coffee. No, I don't like trendy, highly acidic and predominantly citrus profiles, but I think there is some glorious space between that and post second crack. Back to the bar: I have found more and more cases of what seems to be scalded milk or just less cohesion and smoothness overall, in terms of lattes, mochas, etc. I don't know what factors have cause this back-sliding, but I hope they can get it figured out and maybe turn the roaster down a few degrees.Bongo Java was once knocking on the door of the big boys and could have taken things up a notch or two, but instead they remain at a better-than-average level. I will still stop by, when it's convenient, because it remains better than every other place I know of in East Nashville, but I will not go out of my way for it.", "location": "\nMadison, TN\n", "exp": " 14 reviews", "date": "2015-01-24"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nCate H.\n", "review": "Had an iced Americano.

Burnt coffee smell, combined with burnt coffee taste is probably not even the worst of it. I was in East Nashville for the month of November 2008, staying not to far from this joint... My usual drink that I order anywhere, is a strong americano. In a new place, I'll usually say \"extra room\" (for cream) so I know I'll get a strong cup. Well it irritated me when I would say this to the cashier, and it was not repeated to the barista, but when I got into the habit of saying (loudly) \"extra, EXTRA room please\", and every time getting an overflowing cup. The very last chance I gave them for my business was when I went in there about 20 minutes before they were closing (there was about 10 people sitting drinking coffee etc...), staff was mopping the floor in front of the cash machine, I was about to utter the words \"Americano, EXTRA EXTRA ROOM\" and when I caught a glimpse of the terrified look on the cashier's face, I realized that they had already cleaned all their espresso machines for the night, and this would be a real pain in the V for him. SO, I said \"oh, you've cleaned all the machines?\" without him having to say it, and I said \"can I just get a regular coffee then?\" He said \"yeah, that'd be a lot easier\". I paid, got a cup, and helped myself to some lukewarm, burnt coffee.

The gyros were quite good, seasoned well and with a healthy portion of meat inside the pita. The tzatziki sauce was about average, but gave that fresh zing that one wants when biting into gyros. I've eaten gyros in places with well-established Greek communities (Chicago, New York City, Tampa) so my bar is set pretty high and Opa's more than passes.My wife's cheeseburger seemed to be decent, based on the bite I took, but admittedly due to her accidentally putting barbecue sauce instead of ketchup on it, it was hard to say for sure. It wasn't dry, but it also didn't seem very juicy. What she and I both agree on is that the best part of our meal was the hand-cut French fries - crispy on the outside, melt-in-your mouth soft on the inside, and salted with some coarse sea salt. They were delicious!The only part of our visit we did not enjoy was the very loud country music station being piped in, both in the restaurant and to the outside seating. It actually doesn't matter what kind of music it was, because it made it impossible for us to have a conversation over our lunch.

The burger is a pretty good size and the plate was overflowing with fries. The burger wasn't anything special and sadly the egg didn't save it.

This year they have changed everything even their staples on the \u00a0menus from last year. Fontanelles bruschetta was not bruschetta at all. It was a heated hoagie roll with hamburger tomatoes instead of Roma tomatoes and good mozzarella which was screwed up by melting the cheese in the oven. \u00a0I'm sorry I've never eaten a bruschetta that came out of the oven with the exception of the bread itself.

Now it's mashed potatoes with a big beautiful chop with saut\u00e9ed spinach and a knock off marsala sauce.

I tend to favor M Cafe over anything else. I've been going for over a year, and have had a good selection of their food. Let's start with breakfast: I'm mostly a breakfast wrap kinda girl, because they're $4, made on the spot (which means it takes a few minutes -- sometimes it takes more than a few minutes, if there's more than 2 people in line for breakfast, I just go somewhere else.) Note: when they were $3, they were the best deal in the whole building. Now they're just a good option. I've also had the pancakes, which were delicious, the syrup that they sell in store is actually delicious. I love their mixed berry smoothie. For lunch, I've yet to have something I didn't like: their grilled cheese (comes with bacon + jalapeno-peach jam?: nice combo, sweet and salty and delicious) the chipped beef, which smells like heaven and tastes amazing, I'm a big fan of their Southwest chicken wrap, which seems to come on different flavored wraps depending on what they have. I've also had the Sunshine BLT wrap, the chicken pita, and various other specials -- all have been lovely. When their soups have peeked my interest, they've been delicious. The sandwiches range in price from $6-9. I do think this tends to be a little expensive, but they do have a rewards system in place, which I guess softens the blow. I tend not to eat their cold sandwiches, don't know why. Their cold case salads seem a little underwhelming/weird to me. The desserts, btw, tend to be fairly heavenly, so don't be afraid to indulge yourself if you see something that might peek your interest. The coconut cake they make occasionally is something of a dream. The staff has always been very nice to me -- exceedingly nice, actually.

Excellent service. I'm a regular so I'm immediately greeted with my preference of drink and name. I really want to support a local business that takes care of its customers. Thanks for that. Often the line does get long and I'll have to pass if I'm in a rush. When I do stay during a rush, they very effectively get out drinks/food as quickly as possible. I can only recall a few times where I had to wait more then ten minutes during these \"busy\" times.2. Excellent coffee. Really. After drinking in nearly boutique level coffee shops in the Pacific Northwest to the \"we take our coffee very seriously\" Boston proper, my experience at Dose that stays consistently outstanding despite a rotating menu is impressive. 3. Excellent food choices. Okay, the food menu doesn't change as often as the drinks but there are (3) gluten free bakery choices. \u00a0I am very glad that I have a choice of bakery items! It makes me feel like I have control over my life again (just kidding).4. Excellent dining room and cleanliness. There are plenty of places to sit in a relatively small location. Patio seating is a must in the warmer times and always welcome. I rarely find a \"total\" mess that has not been picked up or at least attended to. Bathrooms are clean. Fresh flowers every week. The decor is pretty austere after the remodel but fits the 1950s-1960s urban coffee shop vibe. 5. Excellent prices for -nice- coffee. You want \u00a0gas station degreaser sludge for a dollar?

It is ridiculously close to our house, and even on super-trafficy weekday mornings, it's not impossible to get in and out of the parking lot.The ambiance is nice with adequate seating. I often see folks typing away on their laptops, or conducting small meetings. Seems like a great place for both.While I am a proud owner of a very nice burr grinder, I do not feel that I am a \"coffee snob\" since there is so much to know and learn when it comes to harvesting these little beans that bring me sheer happiness. However, I have found that a can of store-bought-whatever does not suit my taste, but the house coffee Dose serves is quite good.With a strong focus in organic and fair-trade coffees, farm-to-table food, freshly baked goods, all the way to their compostable containers, Dose wins over my heart in multiple arenas. (And I agree, the zucchini muffin is delicious!)Unfortunately, there are a few things that have prevented my rating going beyond three stars.By no means is the staff rude, but they're not overwhelmingly friendly either. If I were in, let's say...Seattle, I would expect this (unless the sun is shining...ha). Here in the South, a little Southern charm is somewhat expected, and goes a long way when you have yet to sip your \"good morning glory\".I'll admit, I'm with my fellow Yelper in that I also subscribe to the international green mermaid chain; partly because I occasionally like to get a little frisky with my coffee by adding some flavor. Unfortunately, the last time I inquired about this at Dose, the syrup selection was quite limited (two of the four offered would literally send me to the infirmary). And while it was not the actual verbal response to my syrup inquiry, it did strongly imply, \"Why would you ruin perfectly good coffee with syrup?\" It was rather off-putting.The other part to my green mermaid willingness is efficiency. Typically they run like well-oiled machines. Dose has not done so well in this area - although there has been some improvement in getting handmade beverages out quicker in my recent visits.Note - I said beverages.Their breakfast sandwiches are truly splendid, but the time it takes to get one feels a bit excessive. Yes, one does need to take into consideration that these sandwiches are not frozen, pre-packaged garbage, so some time needs to be allotted for construction of such deliciousness...Even with this in mind - it still is a bit of a wait.Unfortunately, the last two sandwiches I ordered were prepared incorrectly. On the first, the avocado (the ingredient I was most looking forward to) was missing, and I didn't know it until I returned home. The second one I caught while still on site. It had been prepared with meat that I did not order. So I had to wait again for it to be corrected. One of the owners apologized, and gave me a card to redeem for a free drink - which was very nice of him.I know these folks are serious about their craft, and applaud them for such.

Of note: they sell bagels from Bagel Face Bakery, which has *vegan* bagels and almost all the bagels they sell (I think all of them actually) are listed on Bagel Face's website as being their vegan bagels. Dose should really play this up. I told the barista working there one day, but I don't know whether she passed on this info or not. Unfortunately, although they have some amazing jams, they only serve real butter and cream cheese, so vegans would be limited spread-wise to jelly and nut butter.

But coffee is why Dose is my favorite coffeehouse in Nashville...their selections for the by-the-cup methods, as well as what they choose to have for daily drip have really opened my eyes to the complexity of the bean. They feature independent regional and national roasters that rotate, so there is always something new to try. The loose-leaf tea selections seem to rotate as well. The staff is all knowledgeable, and have settled into the role of the friendly neighborhood shop. They seem to know every regular's usual order. Odds are you will find one of the two owners there slinging espresso or filling food orders. Also, they do some of the prettiest latte art I've seen.They serve Bagel Face bagels with a variety of good spreads including fig preserves, homemade hummus and veggie cream cheese (this also appears to be blended in house). The baked goods are also delicious (that giant cookie is amazing). Their breakfast sandwiches are made with real eggs rather than the stuff you pour from a carton. I admit, my husband and I are usually camped out in a booth doing work on the weekends, but we skedaddle when it starts to get busy in there.Ya, parking sucks. Not really anything you can do about that though. And the city really needs to put a new signal pattern on the intersection at West End...I usually have to dart out and weave through 3 lines of cars to hop on 440. As a regular, I find the busy-ness of Dose is variable in the morning. Some days there's a line 10 people long, and other times I walk up with no one in front of me. I can see why some people complain about the speed, but I'd like to implore them to pick two points from the project triangle: GOOD - CHEAP - FAST.

I would highly recommend the toasted Apple Wrap - sweet, cinnamon, cooked apples, peanut butter, granola, and vanilla yogurt on the side to dip into. \u00a0I'm actually allergic to raw apples, so I love that they cook the apples. \u00a0The granola adds a nice crunchiness and I mean, when wouldn't you want to eat peanut butter? It's a great simple combination. \u00a0Others tell me the PB&G is great too (peanut butter, bananas, and granola) but I'm turned off by the bananas. The Mexicali wrap is alright, it's mostly just rice and beans (a lot of it though). \u00a0I can only tolerate eating it if I also add cheese to the wrap--otherwise it's overwhelmingly plain and reminiscent of what we used to serve at Hunger Banquets.They also have a rotating pasta, panini, and soup of the day. \u00a0I've never tried their pastas, but the panini's have never let me down. \u00a0Last time I was there, they had a delicious focaccia bread with olive tapenade, pesto, ricotta, sundried tomatoes, and mozzarella. Yum. And they're made fresh-to-order. I can't remember the names of the other panini's, but I can attest that I definitely order a panini more often than a wrap, and it's always a great combination of flavors that still fills you up.They also have some cool rotating cold sides that vary from an edamame & corn salad to their famous ranch pasta. The flavors are always refreshing and bright and a great complement to their main dishes.Don't go during the lunch rush if you plan on eating...the wait might take 20-30 minutes in line and then you'd still have to wait for your food. But, if you want a nice light dinner or a late lunch, this would be the perfect spot. They aren't especially quick--small kitchen--but, it's a great light, refreshing, vegetarian dining option. Also they have an extremely inefficient way of calling orders out to you. In theory, they scream your name when your order is up. But, this leads to confusion when common names are dining at the same hour. Also, there is a lot of space and the volume of the order-calling never reaches past the first few tables or over the chattering of customers in line. So, definitely pay attention after you order so that you don't miss yours being called out!

It has the pinkish color to it, rather than the deeper red that fresh tuna is supposed to be. The tamago wasn't even sweet. It tasted like a regular omelet. The octopus had a vinegar base to it, another bad sign. The snapper tasted like it was defrosted from a grocery store. Yuck. For $20, this was one of the worse chirashi bowls ever.

It's their own recipe broth I was told, which tasted like water with a hint of beef broth. Sadly, I'm serious. Aside from the horrible food, the service here was friendly.

There was a white guy and a man of Hispanic decent (not trying to sound racist, he'll I'm black!) dressed is uncoordinated T-shirts and jeans. They each were struggling like they were just thrown into it because the real chef did not show! I gave the sushi a try anyway because I had bough a living social deal soon did not have much to lose. I ordered the futomaki, scallops, \u00a0and the kohana. Futomaki was my safe pick along with scallops. I sat there and watched one of the chefs make my scallop sushi TWICE! He had it right the first time: scallop, wasabi, sushi rice, mayor some nori. Then he decided that was wrong and disassembled my sushi proceeded too mince my scallops and add mayo and some roe! WTF! I tried it and of course it was horrible! My futomaki was good but it was not pretty or cut thick... I expected that with the skill level I saw. The waitress told me the kohana was a good choice; I should have changed my order right then. She was still in training and probably had been trained to say that; too new to have a real opinion. The kohana was supposed to have crawfish, crab, yellowtail, all the good stuff and then it's fried and has yum yum and eel sauce on top. It was fried so hard I had a hard time chewing it! I tasted nothing but sauce and avocado. My waitress did not check on me after I started eating even though she was a few stools down from me. She finally noticed I was watching the Olympics and not eating. She asked if I needed anything else or a to-go box. I told her no that I didn't like the food.

It came with miso soup (which was delicious, better than any I've ever had) and a salad, which was okay. BUT the chicken teriyaki was pretty bad. I was served two long, thin chicken breasts with teriyaki sauce dumped in the middle with a scoop of white rice, an apple piece, an orange piece, a seaweed cucumber mix and two spears of broccoli. This IS NOT ANYTHING like hibachi, so don't order it expecting hibachi. My chicken wasn't even cut into strips. It looked like a plain, bland chicken breast with teryiaki sauce dumped on top, and it tasted even worse. Not to mention, my second chicken breast had a medium sized dark spot in the middle, so I didn't touch it. In their defense, the portions were HUGE. For $9, I got enough food to feed two people. My friend ordered two sushi rolls, and the fish looked very fresh. Granted, it wasn't the best sushi I've ever tasted, but it certainly was fresh. On a side note, if you're a sashimi fan, I bet they have great sashimi. Price- One reason I didn't order a specialty roll is because most of them are $15. If I recall correctly, they're all in the $14-$18 range, which is pretty steep for a lunch roll. You might as well go to Virago and sit on their cool patio and eat for that price. There are SEVERAL rolls that are in the $6-$12 range, they just are the blander, simpler rolls that I personally don't care for. But, if you like these types of rolls, you'd probably be pretty impressed. Service- was spotty and awkward. It took several minutes (even though the restaurant was nearly empty) for our server to introduce himself and take our drink order. Our server was polite, but our interactions were somewhat uncomfortable. However, I did notice that the owner of the restaurant was very interactive with her customers. And, when the hostess sat us, she gave us hot towels for our hands, which was a nice touch. Cleanliness- The restaurant was very clean, and still has that new smell! Parking- They have a private lot and a valet. You won't have a problem finding parking. I doubt I will eat here again. The food and service just didn't stand out to me enough.

I was extremely excited to see a new sushi restaurant opening near my business office, particularly after checking the reviews for Kohana in Hendersonville and Clarksville. My wife and I went with great expectations.Let me start by saying that the restaurant's only been open a little while. Still, our waiter told us the owners had \"imported\" staff and chefs from the other restaurants, so the recent opening is no excuse.We arrived the first time just after dinner hour opening, were greeted and seated by a friendly hostess. When we got up to look at the sushi bar, the sushi chef behind it couldn't be bothered to look up and greet us - not even make eye contact. We stood there awkwardly for a minute, then returned to the table.We ordered age dashi tofu, which arrived in a huge mound of slightly-warm tofu with a dash - really, just a dash - of sauce. Nothing else on it. When we asked the waiter where the grated daikon the menu promised was, he checked with the chef, then came back to say \"Chef says they've never, ever made it that way, he doesn't understand why it says that on the menu.\" The tofu was mealy, the sauce was forgettable, and without the grated vegetables, disappointing.We ordered the gyoza, which were actually quite good - not fried to death like so many other restaurants. Reminiscent of the old Shintomi when it was still the best in this area. However, the gyoza sauce tasted like someone had thrown a batch of vinegar into a bowl, splashed a teaspoon of soy sauce, and forgotten any other ingredients.(As an aside, until it went fervently downill my wife and daughters and I ate at Shintomi at least twice a week for years. They had the best gyoza sauce I've ever eaten, including in Tokyo!)We loved the beautiful picture menu of sushi rolls. My wife adores crab, and was excited to see that certain rolls specified \"crabstick\" (surimi - imitation crab), while another specified \"snow crab.\" Since she is allergic to imitation crab, she happily ordered the roll made with \"snow crab.\" Ordinarily, if a restaurant lists the two differently, we don't double check, but the prior two dishes made me nervous, so I asked the waiter whether it was in fact real snow crab. \"Oh, no. ALL our crab is imitation crabstick.\" What? Really?! With snow crab cheap enough that Denny's features it, you're substituting surimi? Yes. Fake crab. In a restaurant charging $14-$18 a roll!Well, we cancelled the roll and moved on. I ordered ikura sushi, one of my personal tests of a good Japanese restaurant, along with seaweed salad. The salad was delicious. The ikura was embarrassingly bad. I would expect to see it at an all-you-can-eat sushi buffet.Thinking perhaps a non-Japanese item would fare better, we ordered the calimari. Delicious.I went back for lunch a few days later, and again asked about the crab, and was told the same thing. When I asked why the three menus at dinner and lunch differentiated between \"snow crab\" \"crab stick\" and \"imitation crab\", the waiter just shrugged.If you want good Japanese food in Nashville, without the health complications of a corporate entity that cheaps out where it counts (and don't think the imitation crab rolls are inexpensive!), go to Midori. It's a bit of a hike, but the sushi's always good, and their Korean food is excellent. Or go to Koto, sometimes hit or miss but usually very good. Or try Miyako. Or even Hanabi, which has begun to slide but is still way more than decent.

As my friends pulled up to the swingingly seventies building that houses Woodlands, I was looking for the escape cord. 'No way,' I thought. Had I left things there, I would have missed out on some very tasty grub. There's a reason why the dining room was packed for an early-ish dinner on a Thursday evening. People looking for affordable vegetarain Indian fare know where to come. Here. They come here. The dining room won't win any HGTV contests. It's very very red. The color red usually agitates me so I willed myself to go into a Zen-like state. This was helped by the chai tea I ordered. This was so so much better than anything a green mermaid could dream up. Despite the tea being hot and me ordering the drink during summer, I had to stop myself from gulping it all down at once. Mmm, cardamom... Chillaxed from my beverage, it was time to order. One of the great things about ordering Indian food in a group is the opportunity to try a lot of things at once. Despite this being (I think) a south Indian restaurant, I didn't opt for a dosa. I'm pretty particular when it comes to dosa and had to test the waters before jumping in. I'm fairly certain that I'll be ordering dosa upon my next visit. The food was really tasty. With copious amounts of steamed basmati rice and garlic naan at the ready, we jumped in to the ordering pool and came out happier people. My entry in to the food goodness was the coconut curry. I know it doesn't sound adventurous but who needs adventure when there's cauliflower, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and potatoes to be had? The curry milk broth wasn't too soupy and the consistency allowed the vegetables to shine, rather than be drowned in the mix. The baingan bartha and malai kofta were big hits as well. Don't be deceived by the metal bowls in which the food comes. Between 3 adults and one child, we couldn't finish four entrees (with naan and rice and raita). I know! I was surprised, too. Our server seemed mildly humored by our fear of a spice planet and he was very friendly and helpful during our meal. I left Woodlands understanding why it has such a fiercely loyal following.

Bonus points if you broadcast the fact that your horrible vegetarian friends dragged you here.2) Describe in lavish detail the specific dishes that convinced you that Woodlands is, in fact, a wonderful place to dine, and rhapsodize about how your meal was in no way diminished by not having fragments of selected animal carcasses lurking within it.3) Complete your conversion narrative! Lord, lord almighty, you have seen the light!So yeah, I'm not a vegetarian either, so I guess I'll quit making fun of you now. The reason that Woodlands is so awesome is twofold: first, they have a huge and intimidating menu with everything you could possibly want on it. The descriptions are cryptic, many of them are strongly similar, and you'll find yourself wondering about what will actually come out of the kitchen. I ordered puri there once because I was in the mood for something lighter, and they served me an enormous puffy bread somewhat larger than a football that I cautiously prodded with my knife for fear that it might emit some sort of hazardous spume (spoiler alert: it did not). Second, everything is fantastically prepared, reasonably priced, and very very tasty. The curries with almonds and/or cashews are my favorite--nutty and spicy.OK, so I lied: the reasons are actually threefold--it's also BYOB. Thus, your dinner can be as fancy as you want it to be.

If you don't foodgasm from the flavor sensation in your mouth, you somehow did it wrong. I may start giving lessons.Another must is the gobi manchurian dry, which is an appetizer.

I had originally planned on going back a few weeks ago, but New York and life got in the way... so it did not happen until the 9th of November. \u00a0I got in about 1:15 for the buffet.I had Medhu Vada (fried lentil doughnut), onion rings, Veggie Pulav (rice with spice), Coconut rice, Rajma Palek (I believe it was chopped spinach and something chewy), Dal Tadka (yellow lentils, onion and tomato) Paratha bread and a salad.The place has done some cosmetic updates since the last time I was there, quite a bit nicer than it was. \u00a0It reminded me much less of a meeting room that had been converted to a restaurant, and quite a bit more like a restaurant. \u00a0They did a good job on that.The fried lentil doughnut I got was cold, I am not sure if it was supposed to be room temperature or not, it tasted like moist crumbling bread with a slightly acidic taste. \u00a0The onion rings were room temp as well, non-crispy outside breading, but the flavor of the onion was quite striking. \u00a0Not something I would eat much of but a nice flavor.The veggie pulav was good, it was a little spicy (I think, had things all mixed up at one point or another) the Dal Tadka lentil concoction was good, but did not pop. \u00a0The paratha bread I imagine is good when it's warmer, but it was cold.One of the dishes had suffered a salt overload (I think the cook must have dumped some in the side) so every third or fourth bite was a ton of salt. I do not think this was standard or intentional.The potato pancake appeared later, somehow it always appears when you've had too much food and want to stop. \u00a0I don't particularly like the potato pancake, but I do not think that is limited to woodlands. \u00a0It was good, as far as unrequested potato pancakes go.The salad. \u00a0It may just be that this is the style, but it's the same thing I've always disliked about woodland's... the lettuce tastes like it's ... I don't know, it's not wilted yet, but it's not crisp... the corn in the salad was kind of sweet but tasted a little like it had been boiled and then frozen for a while. \u00a0The short of it is I did not like the buffet salad.This particular round on the buffet I was not as disappointed as I've been. \u00a0The atmosphere has been upgraded, the food was a little spicier. \u00a0I still don't hate the place, but it's really not for me... the buffet seems to lack (at 1:15 on a random Tuesday).For my call-out from Peter K (who also convinced me to go back) I did a quick survey of the ethnicity of the customers, when I went there were no Indian customers, but perhaps that's just because it was 1pm. \u00a02 white people in front of me, behind and to the left. \u00a0fairly unpacked at 1:15.I will stand by my original review of the buffet, this style may appeal to you, it may be authentic, but for flavor explosions that appeal to my pallet I go elsewhere. \u00a0Your mileage may vary, you will not hate this restaurant and it may be for you.

Well, more the fact of meat out, veggies and fish in. After years of dithering, I realised that I simply had to be true to myself and reject that, that wasn't. I'm four weeks in and I am wondering if I am breaking. Mainly because I am on a work trip to the south and have discovered that I can eat bugger all.

But tonight, faced with yet another night of optionless meals, I went for it and yelped Nashville for vegetarian options - and Woodlands came up. First up was a vegetable samosa platter - essentially, unlike the samosas I have had in the past, these were slices of vegetables fried in a thick almost-pastry like batter. A little dry and heavy for my tastes and overall, rather tasteless, with sauces that neither complimented nor provided detriment to them. Then I had the Bombay Bhaji - mooshed up vegetables, with rice, mango chutney and a lemon raita. Bonus points - my server asked what spice level I wanted - honestly it was a bit too spicy for me, but if I go again, I will know to ask for a more mild version. So at a guess I would say in my veggie mash there was tomatoes, onion, non-mooshed peas and potato - anything else, I couldn't tell you - but it did taste cliantro/spicy infused goodness. The lemon raita was a great addition, but the mango chutney was way too bitter for my tastes. The bhaji was also perfect for naan-dipping - which was a little over toasted and not as fluffy as I would like.

(Although, I do enjoy my meat)First off, for those of you who are driving, it's right next to the hotel. But, you do not need to actually enter the hotel to enter the restaurant. My friends and I unfortunately realized this the hard way, when one of them decided to ring the bell for service to enter the hotel. \u00a0When we realized that the entrance to the restaurant was just to the left, we quickly sneaked away, hoping not to be noticed.That aside, the lunch buffet is pretty spacious (when you compare it to Bombay Palace--also the space is significantly easier to navigate--Bombay Palace's buffet area is like one small walk-in closet). \u00a0There is a good selection of different foods to taste. \u00a0The rice was fantastic as was a spinach/cheese dish--one of my favorites. \u00a0They also offer dosas, similar to Bombay Palace, which are kind of like crepes with lentil/potato/something-delicious filled inside. \u00a0My dining party and I had a whole argument about whether they were filled with lentils or potatoes. I still contend that there were potatoes inside--although, my research on Wiki says that the crepe part does include crushed lentils. Either way, they are delicious. \u00a0Unlike Bombay Palace, they also offer Puri which are the really thin, crispy breads. \u00a0Side note, I love Indian breads. Also they had some other interesting things like a lentil donut and a sweet cinnamon shredded carrot dessert.They also offered a cauliflower dish that was called a curry, but I'm not sure why. It was pretty amazing how they got the cauliflower to have a meat-like texture, but it created some cognitive conflict in my mouth when it had the exact texture and flavor of General Tso's Chicken. It was bizarre and I'm not sure if that's a good thing.The food is pretty good, but I think Bombay Palace's is better. It just seems more flavorful--maybe that has more to do with the Northern/Southern cuisine differences. I don't know enough about Indian cuisine to decide.

One of my cousins has had bad reactions to the food at some Chinese restaurants, and has theorized MSG was the culprit, if not something else. As a routine, she asks about it in any new restaurants. \u00a0As soon as we walked in the door, we asked the host if they used MSG, or any other additives or allergens. He said to steer clear of the Indochina section. Beyond that he wasn't exactly reassuring, and I felt, a bit dismissive. We sat down and ordered drinks. I looked to my left and saw a cockroach on the drapes. Horrified, but not surprised given the type of building Woodlands is in, I let it go because the food is good enough to deal. That and I didn't feel like driving to Sitar. I ordered the chana palak. The spinach was undercooked and I found a bay leaf in it. I also asked for spicy but the dish was bland, so I had to ask for chili on the side. It was disappointing overall and I left most of it on the plate. So the meal was wrapping up and my cousin got up and walked outside. She returned a few minutes later with a look of panic and tears in her eyes and said her throat was closing up. We paid, and explained that she was having a bad reaction to the food. The host looked alarmed, and I hope he remembers what happened. It pays to understand the ingredients your own restaurant works with! Please, do some simple research, so whether it was an additive or a common food allergen, you can know what to tell people who ask about them. Luckily Vandy was nearby, and we went straight to the ER. Meds and a handful of hours of observation later, all was back to normal.

I am not a vegetarian so I can't fully appreiciate this place. Having said that I wished they would serve soome dishes that have a little more substance (beans, lentils, eggplant, chickpeas, peas, cheese, etc.) . There is way too much starch - even many of the vegetable dishes are very heavy on the potatoes (the vegetable korma resembles coconut and potato soup). Perhaps this is a regional thing but prepare yourself for bread,potatoes, rice, bread, potatoes, rice.....The food quality is good. One compaint would be that a lot of the dishes taste too similar and don't have much character of their own. Very mild for Southern Indian food. Very mild. The must have item there is the Puri - soft and delictable. The raita is very, very good but I wouldn't recommend the dahi vada (I found it inedible). They bring dosas to your table, they have a great texture but a tad bland for my taste.If you are put off by the hotness of Indian food, try this place.On last thing the iced tea is gross.

Luckily, you can find almost anything with a GPS unit.The ambiance of the restaurant left much to be desired, but it's not meant to be a fine dining experience.

This is by no means a sign of a good or bad restaurant, but I do love that smell. We picked out a few hot items (Bombay Bhaji Dosa, Palak Paneer, the appetizer sampler) and dove right in, and sure enough it was all rock solid.A dosa is a piece of thin fried dough (similar to a crepe) that is served with dipping sauces. In my case, they were a yummy spicy tomato sauce, a chutney cream sauce, and a somewhat thin potato soup kind of thing. I'm sure there are official names for these sauces, but I don't have to know them to like them. The paneer is a traditional spinach and cottage cheese dish that is found at most Indian places, and my wife thought it was very good, but not significantly better than others she's had.In general, this was a very good Indian restaurant that probably wouldn't be the best I've ever had, but was a nice relief from the intense pork and BBQ-themed meals that have dominated our trip to Nashville.

Woodlands deserves all five stars for that alone. I'm pretty picky about my Indian restaurants, since I can generally get much better at an Indian friend's home. But Woodlands offers (in this ferengi's humble opinion) pretty authentic Southern Indian fare. Warming spices, earthy lentil flour, and tangy chutneys rule the day.On your first trip, the dosa is a must. Basically a crisp and slightly chewy paper-thin pancake rolled around a filling and served with dips. Try the paper masala dosa. As big as yer' head, served with comfortingly perfect potatoes masala, sambar (a savory delicious soup with potatoes and eggplant in broth), and coconut chutney, whose excellence you have to taste to believe.Feeling a bit adventurous? Give pani puri a try. Pani refers to a sweet-tangy-spicy seasoned tamarind water, which you pour into a puri, a hollow fried-crisp round bread filled with potatoes and peas. Before the whole contraption self-destructs, you pop it into your mouth whole, and whomp down on a refreshing and intensely flavorful explosion. You crunch, you slurp, you savor, and then you wipe off your chin and grab another.Curries are great too. My favorite is chana palak, chickpeas and spinach. But really everything you get is good. I can't remember the real name, but the \"veggie balls\" are also good, served in a creamy spicy orange sauce not unlike tikka masala.I usually warn, besmirch, doomsay, beg people to order from the menu rather than succumb to the ease of an Indian buffet, but Woodlands is the exception. Excellent buffet with a fine selection of curries, rice dishes, soups, bread, chutneys, salads and desserts.

I had no clue. He nickel and dimed us for everything. We ordered water and he came back with BOTTLED -- what?! My friend ordered a burger and he charged her for fries (who serves a burger with chips) and asked her what kind of cheese she wanted -- charged for that too.

This week marked my second time eating there, and will absolutely be the last.Food:Had the chicken and waffles on my first visit. Chicken was really good, waffles were obviously frozen, bought in bulk from Sysco. This visit I decided to try their burger (which they claim was voted best in Nashville by a local publication. Unfortunately, there is no evidence online that supports that claim. So, liars?)The burger patty itself was good. Quality meat, cooked to order, and decently seasoned. However, there was way way too much arugula, so everything just tasted peppery. Oh, and like onions. Probably because they put 3 rings of raw, red onion cut at least 3/4\" thick. Now, I love onions, in any form, on or in pretty much everything. This was overkill and would have rendered the burger inedible if I hadn't removed it.The fries were awful. Limp, soggy, hand cut wayyyyy too thick. The seasoning blend on them were delicious, but I was only able to force myself to eat 2 or 3. I guess that's okay, because I only got seven (7!!!!!) fries in my side order, which I substituted for chips.Which brings me to one of the biggest issues I have with the food: the price. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, with fries. The burger, which is normally $12, became over $18 by the time my bill came. $2 for bacon (that was not good bacon, too thin), $1 for one slice of American Cheese, and $2 extra for the horrendous fries described above.Bar/Booze:The bartender on duty both trips had NO idea what she was doing. Although she was sweet, we caught her consulting her phone and recipes behind the bar to make drinks that, quite frankly, any beginning barkeep should know. I stuck with beer this last time, and while I appreciate their variety of quality beers, $6 for a bottle of local Hefeweizen or $7 for a local Stout? Seriously?Prices:Even for the tourist trap that is Broadway, as touched on above, their prices are ridiculously out of line for the quality, decor, and service. $25+ for a burger, fries, and a (low-gravity) draft beer is robbery.Decor/Interior:Standard dive bar. Decent patio area. Non-smoking inside. Nice sized stage, but no one was playing either time we were there. TVs throughout, most on either sports or soap operas. Restrooms were small but clean. No soap in the men's room. And no paper towels, only a hand drier. Also, the lock doesn't work, apparently.Management/Service:First visit it was slow inside. Us (party of 3) and 2, maybe 3, other tables. Manager(?)/cook and bartender both sitting at the end of the bar, both eating and watching TV. The manager guy was smoking an e-cig and never once washed his hands before going in to the kitchen to (I assume) cook.This second visit I was with 3 other people, all women. The bar was much busier, but we still got our drinks and food withing a decent amount of time. Ended up chatting with the owner and the door guy for a bit. He's the less famous brother of a C-list musician, and boy, is he something else. Alternating between rude and creepy/sexist. I won't delve into details, but suffice to say, this guy should stick to anything other than owning bars.Overall:Food: 3/5Decor/Interior: 2/5Service: 3/5Prices: 0/5Bar/Booze: 2/5AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.Update: After talking with one of my female friends about this place and the review I posted, she told me that Joey, the owner, kept telling her about the expansion they're doing and asked her if she wanted to see the \"upstairs\". Like I said, creep.Also, this dude mentioned his bar in New York more than once, so I decided to check them out on Yelp. Not only are they closed, but the reviews are pretty comparable to the ones on here. One even mentions their weird door guy, Sasha, by name.

I've been to New York, I've had burgers I'll decide if it's got true burger and New York city credentials. After having spent a good time and a decent amount of money there I have to say that burger wise it's a great place for a burger but I have no idea how 'New York' they are. The menu here is simple and uncomplicated, burger, cheeseburger, chicken sandwich. I didn't know about the lack of items and the burger comes with grilled potatoes not fries-which I thought might also be weird and a flop. I was wrong on both counts.The cheeseburger comes with grilled onions and mushrooms no extra charges for anything like that, just added in without a word of it on the menu. Awesome. The burger itself was juicy, flavorful and just making me think about it now makes me want another one. The grilled potatoes were also a winner and were oh so good. I still want to know how a grilled starch can be so moist and tasty and the only complaint I had was that there weren't enough of them, literally like 6 fries (I'm still using the term fries because saying 'grills' just sounds silly.)They also have a menu of Monster mixed drinks, with a variety of different flavored Monster cocktails. I settled on the KAOS Monster (a pineapple/orange variety) with vodka. I also tried the KAOS and rum cocktail-which is an interesting mix on the vodka/pineapple, rum/pineapple.

On that day as many of my team try to go out for lunch together as possible. So there are usually 3-6 people. This past week we decided to try this place out as many of us had not been there. 6 of us in this group and we went a tick early (11:30).Service: Slow, I think the girl working was the only one working the front of the house.The menu is only in chalk on the wall, great if you are facing the wall when you sit down. Seriously get more menus or make it easier to see. It is $2, that is right TWO DOLLARS for water. They won't bring you tap water you have to buy a bottle. Mixed drinks at lunch are $8, EIGHT FREAKING DOLLARS for a drink at lunch on a Tuesday. Tea, coke products and the like are $2 and you get refills. I ordered a cheese burger, medium rare no bun. I got a fairly decently cooked burger with what looked like an American cheese slice on it. I don't mind paying $11 for a burger but seriously this one wasn't worth it. ALL sandwiches come with a small handful of kettle chips (potato chips out of bag). There wasn't a cheese selection, or bread choice etc. There was a stack that contained lettuce, tomato slice, onion and 2 pickles. One person order a side of grilled potatoes and there were maybe 4 slices but she didn't receive her chips with the sandwich. The potatoes are signed as an appetizer so it wasn't fair to not deliver both. Others at the table felt the food was MEH. A lot of folks don't like to spend a bunch of money on lunch, which is why they don't like to eat on that block. But let's compare. National Underground burger $11 + water $2 = $13 plus tip. On the same block burger (bourbon glaze, onion straws and Gorgonzola with fries) $10.95 + water $0 \u00a0= $10.95 plus tip. Hmm better values can be had elsewhere. I am sad that more places don't give a hoot about folks that are stuck downtown because they work there. This place is catering/charging for the tourist crowd because they can.

As a music venue, they give smaller up-and-coming acts (mostly acoustic or country-leaning) a chance to play live in a part of town that is normally reserved for tourist-snaring country covers or overdone karaoke. The room is small - I'd be surprised if 40 people could fit comfortably - but the sound of the room is respectable. There is never a cover, and most live acts are paid based on the cash bar take. The idea is that bands are paid based on how well they draw and hold paying customers. Luckily, most of the groups I've come to see have not overwhelmed the audience with encouragement to drink more, which is more than I can say for the honkytonks up the road.The food is another story. It's not terrible, but it is overpriced and over-hyped. My biggest pet peeve is the constant message perpetuated by the owners that National Underground has \"the best burger in Nashville.\" It's one thing to make this kind of pompous claim. Delivering on that promise is quite another. The basic cheeseburger is $11, a price which they do not put anywhere on the table card that passes as a menu. It is a big burger, but it's average at best and a little too salty. I also found it very overpriced. If you want a good burger, there are better places in Nashville at the same or less price (Rotier's, Burger Up, the Pharmacy and Belcourt Taps & Tapas, to name a few). The beer prices were high, but they were no worse than any other spot on lower Broadway tourist strip.My bartender was friendly, and she gets a lot of brownie points for customer service. Our bill arrived without any of my girlfriend's order listed (1 burger and 2 beers). I pointed out that it was half of what it should have been, and our bartender thanked me for my honesty. However, she could not find any mention of the second meal and beers in their register, so she comped it. I split the difference with her on the tip, and I'm giving them the third star for the customer-first attitude.The Nashville branch of National Underground is a fairly new music venue, so I am hopeful they will get better once they've worked through the bugs in their system.

Seriously. back in my halcyon teenage youth, I once gave up eating all meat for about 10 months only to be lured back to the darkside by a cheeseburger. So, just know that I take hamburgers very seriously.After reading all these rave reviews about how the burgers at The National Underground were the best in town, I managed to convince my husband to brave the horror that is Broadway after an event at the Frist to try them out. So, obviously a strike against this place right from the get go, because while I'll happily head to East Nashville or Nolensville Road for good grub, I HATE going to Nashville's honkytonk strip. Parking is a pain in the tush, and the parade of humanity that trawls that end of town makes me stabby. But again, I will brave such hardships if the food is good.When we make it to National Underground, we're pretty much the only patrons there so we decide to sit at the bar. There are a few tables littered about, but it's clear that even though food is served here, this place is definitely a bar and a music venue. Much to our chagrin, we got there just in time to catch a solo act who serenaded us with a variety of Billy Joel tunes during our dinner which was really awkward. Nashville is a tough music city so I feel really bad for performers who sign their hearts out to what is essentially an empty room. This guy wasn't bad, but there was a lot of falsetto going on and it was definitely distracting. If you want to catch a show while you eat, this is ideal, but if you have any interest in speaking to your dining companion, this is a big negative. Still, the promise of a cheeseburger kept me strong, despite an intense case of second-degree embarrassment. With all this build up, I suppose it's no surprise the cheeseburgers we got were disappointing and didn't really seem worth the effort. They were certainly massive, as everyone else has pointed out (I only ate half of mine and took the rest to go), and they were juicy too. But were they so juicy because they were also cooked extremely rare, not the medium-rare we had ordered? Perhaps. And were they also over-seasoned (read: salty)? Yes. The buns they were served on were also a travesty as they pretty much disintegrated as soon as we picked up our burgers... I get that burgers aren't dainty food, but these were so messy I almost wanted to ask for a knife and fork. None of these things were deal-breakers, mind, nor were our burgers bad, but for \"best\" burgers, they could have been better. Probably the thing I remember most about our meal was actually the grilled potato slices that came with our burgers. My husband is a diehard french fry fiend, so I expected him to dismiss the potatoes quickly, but he wound up really enjoying them. Some of my slices were perhaps more charred than I would have preferred, but they were a nice addition.Can I also just say that National Underground employs one of my BIGGEST PET PEEVES? Their food menu has NO PRICES on it!!! I HATE when restaurants have drink menus without prices on them, so it should go without saying that I don't like going to a bar where you have to ask the price of your meal because it's not printed on the menu. It always makes me feel like a cheapskate to have to ask how much something is, but I would be lying if I said I didn't take into account how much things cost when it comes placing my order. I think our burgers wound up cost $10 each, which is fair, but I would have liked to have known this when ordering.All in all, I actually really liked the atmosphere of this place (the twinkle lights around Christmas were a nice touch) either as a bar or as a venue to catch a show. But I don't think I'd go back if eating were my sole goal, because while the food was good, there were a lot of obstacles involved to get it and there are plenty of other places in Nashville that make a better burger without the hassle. If you're going because you want to drink or hear live music, then by all means, the burger is better than most, but it's not the one that will get vegetarians to renounce their convictions.", "location": "\nToronto, Canada\n", "exp": " 136 reviews", "date": "2012-01-24"}, {"rating": "1.0", "name": "\nSpencer S.\n", "review": "I've never had a worse experience at a restaurant/bar. \u00a0We sat for at least half an hour before we finally walked to the bar to get some water. \u00a0After we returned to the table, we sat for another while before chasing down a server and requesting someone visit our table. \u00a0Owner, Rick, approached our table a little while later telling us that he was going to need our table. \u00a0We explained that we would LIKE to order food and drinks, but no one would serve us. \u00a0He was hateful and walked off as he was on his phone. \u00a0We chased down another server and asked again for menus and a chance to place an order. \u00a0It was about ten minutes before she made it to our table. \u00a0She didn't ask for drink orders, but she did take our food order. \u00a0We had to continue to visit the bar for water and drinks, which were forgotten and never arrived most of the time. \u00a0Rick brought our baskets of food out to us. \u00a0It was incorrect. \u00a0He was hateful as usual, put the food down, and walked away. \u00a0Our server came over and explained what happened. \u00a0Shortly after, while visiting the restroom (our untouched food, drinks, phones, etc were still on the table), our table was bussed and cleaned. \u00a0After this, we were missing food and a cell phone. \u00a0The servers were less than interested to help, but, after insisting on a tab, had no problem charging us for the food and drinks. \u00a0Did I mention that \"our\" server had since clocked out and was outside counting her tips? \u00a0Never found the cell phone...

I talk myself out of going to \"expensive\" restaurants all the time for fear of having a disappointing experience. Sometimes those fears are unfounded, all too often they are not. The evening started out with so much promise. From the valet out front to the honest to god Maitre D' just inside, the place just screams \"old-school\" class. Frank Sinatra would have felt at home seated in a high-backed leather chair at a white linen covered table in one of their cozy oak-paneled private rooms. The service was top notch. Our waiter, Pee Wee, who'd been at working at the establishment \"off and on\" since 1978, was absolutely perfect. He read my wife and I completely, provided helpful suggestions, and came by only and always when needed. We weren't looked down upon or ignored because we were ordering off the \"special\" menu. When it comes to the food I have just two words for you: Meat. Glue. I am not a butcher, a chemist, or an adhesives expert, but I've worked in enough steakhouses and have seen my fair share of meat glue steaks. Go ahead and open a new browser tab and Google that if you have to/dare. It's a dirty little secret of the meat industry akin to the pink slime found in ground beef. Maybe Jimmy Kelly's chef doesn't know that he's being sold frankenfilet, or he does and doesn't care; I'm not sure which bothers me more. I halfway considered asking for steak sauce.It didn't end there. Our baked potatoes were served still in tinfoil, and the toppings (for which we were charged an additional fee...seriously?) came in paper ramekins, a la McDonald's ketchup. The salads were bagged iceberg and the house Gorgonzola dressing was reminiscent of Kraft, or maybe, if I'm being generous, Wishbone. The corn cakes all the other reviewers rave about? Burnt. A truly disappointing meal. The only thing we enjoyed beyond the atmosphere, the service, and the drinks were the mushrooms and the two cobblers: blackberry and apple walnut. You're safe ordering those I'm sure --the rest? Well, you're on your own. In short, if you go, get something bone-in (harder to fake with meat glue), skip the potato, and soak up the classy atmosphere, the good service, and plenty of tasty tasty liquor.

I've been to many fine steakhouses around the country and had heard this was one of the best. What we experienced last night was quite the opposite, unfortunately. We were a large group (12) so had made reservations weeks in advance. They paraded all of us upstairs and through and around many quiet diners to a room in the back. A perfect spot for a group, however the tables had not been set up. So, they paraded us back through the dining room and left us as a group on the upstairs landing where we were clearly in the way of the wait staff. We were finally seated, but place settings were incomplete (2 people didn't have forks until after the appetizer course was done) and we soon found the one waiter we had (we'd been told we'd have 2) was not really capable of managing such a large table. At one of the premier steak houses in town, we expected service to be excellent, and this was sadly lacking. Empty drink glasses were removed but no refills offered. Meals came to the table incomplete. A la carte sides, which patrons are encouraged to share among the table, are disappointingly small. Our waiter made a point of telling us how large the asparagus were, and great for sharing. When it arrived there were 4 asparagus (and not the jumbo ones) on the plate. When the time came for dessert, he took orders from some of the table but not everyone, then did the same with coffee. In terms of the quality of the food- the value was sadly lacking for the price. I've had much better steak at Logan's or Outback, and that's just so disappointing. I ordered the special bone-on filet which the waiter raved about. It had so little flavor that I nearly cried when I got the $60 bill. I'm happy to pay a premium for fine food, but this time I literally just threw my money away. My fiancee's manhattan, which was good but no better than a manhattan anywhere else, was $21. Again, I don't mind paying for quality, but nothing about our meal or the service justified those prices. The only redeeming aspect of the meal was my fiancee's cowboy steak (ribeye) that was prepared with the creole seasoning- it really was pretty incredible.

So amp it up in the seasonings department a little Jimmy Kelly!The house salad was good, nothing to write home about. The twice baked potato, on the other hand, was definitely letter worthy.

My jumbo shrimp were awesome - I've had lobster tails smaller than these shrimp, and believe me, the shrimp tasted better. The blackberry cobbler desert was awesome.Now the bad and unfortunate things. This is a steakhouse. You come here for steak. I remember distinctly some of the best steaks I've ever had coming from this restaurant, and I really looked forward to that. My filet, ordered medium, came well done and extra dry. Instead of filet mignon I got filet jerky. After everyone at the table was done with their slightly overdone steaks, an obviously overcooked steak finally came out much later than promised. It seems like the steaks were sitting under a heat lamp or on a heated rack waiting for pick-up. The waiter was kind enough to take my suggestion of only charging me for the shrimp and baked potato. But I was still hungry even after taking my table mates' leftovers. Then came the onion rings that were supposed to a side dish, not desert. They were good, don't get me wrong, just very late. They comped these as well, which was a nice gesture.On top of the twice destroyed filets, I found myself sucking on ice cubes because my tiny glass of water was slow to be refilled. I think the root problem was a decision by management to take care of a large party - that arrived after my party of six - at the expense of service to other diners. My sever worked hard and was polite, but was clearly given too much to handle as he assisted other servers working the large party.

Not inedible, but it just did not taste fresh & clean. \u00a0The baked potato tasted like it had been cooking for several hours, and it was brought out with freezing cold butter and sour cream. \u00a0To cap it off, several people ordered desserts. \u00a0I don't remember what anyone ordered so I guess that tells you how mediocre they were. \u00a0My other gripe is that when the server brought out the second bottle of wine she did not give us fresh wine glasses. \u00a0FAIL. \u00a0Other than that she did a good job, but that's not cool. \u00a0We didn't realize what she was doing until she'd already done it. \u00a0Also there were some very loud people in the bar which made for a strange juxtaposition of vibes...very formal and upscale in the dining room, and then 20 feet away Bubba is yelling for his team in the bar. \u00a0Awkward...So like I said - the wine was the best part of the experience. \u00a0It's the only reason I don't give the place one star. \u00a0Meh, not impressed at all. \u00a0I don't plan on returning.", "location": "\nBrentwood, TN\n", "exp": " 201 reviews", "date": "2013-02-01"}, {"rating": "2.0", "name": "\nJD C.\n", "review": "We visited Jimmy Kelly's looking for a great steakhouse experience.

I think of everything, which I will list momentarily, the one thing that rose above all of this was the server being argumentative with my husband over his order. Listen, doll, if anyone is going to give that man a hard time, it is me. Over the last 21 years, I have earned it and finely-honed my skills, so I say to thee, \"how dare you?\"And, now, some comments:* Yelp, I gave just one star, not because they didn't deserve two but because the 2-star rating indicated that my experience wasn't DISMAL and it was. \"I've experienced better?\" Yes, I've experienced a better treatment of beef at Krystal. At 2 a.m.* Mike Kelly, you should be ashamed of yourself. Your family worked hard to bring this restaurant to life and survive in the cutthroat food industry for 7 decades. Take some time away from leaning on the bar and watching a replay of a Devils-Kings game from 2 nights ago to walking around your restaurant. Visit with your guests and when one goes so far as to indicate that the evening is not going well, delve a little deeper and find out what's going on. Walk through the kitchen throughout the night and let them know that you care and you're watching. Have someone come in and give those restrooms a thorough cleaning. Watch as appetizers are being sent back and entrees are leaving tables with more than half of the food still on them. Mike, that's YOUR name out there on the sign. Defend it. You were here in Nashville before any of those other steakhouses. It's your birthright. Bring back the Jimmy Kelly's that Nashvillians know, and love and respect.* To our server, whom I did not get your name but I think you have to stand out as one of, if not the only, female servers at Jimmy Kelly's. Was last night your first night? Just tell me that. You greeted us and tried to take our drink orders. You asked if we would like some wine when we hadn't been given a wine menu yet. When I asked if you had sweet tea, you answered \"yes. \u00a0Well, it's unsweet and I can bring you some sugar.\" Baby, this is the south. Tea is sweet and it's equal parts -- 1 cup of sugar to 1 tea bag. Plain and simple. When my husband complained that his steak wasn't right, did you know right then that you had keyed in the order wrong or did you discover that later? We all make mistakes but man up and accept it when you do. My husband gave you a tip last night. Partly because he's a nice guy. I also suspect he did this merely so we could go and salvage the last few minutes that we had a babysitter. Here's my tip for you: \u00a0find one of your fellow co-workers in a white dinner jacket and follow him around for a week or two. Learn the ropes from these veterans. * To Fred, another server at the restaurant who was assigned to an adjacent table. \u00a0We watched you throughout the evening, smiling and happy and providing top notch service to your table while we floundered in the corner with our gal. We watched you be attentive without hovering. We watched you glide in a beautiful minuet as you showered that other table with drinks, playful banter, corn cakes and impeccable service. And at the end, when everything blew up, it was you who stepped in and showed concern. Not our server. Not the house manager. And not that guy whose name is on the sign. No, it was you, Fred, who apologized for our experience and who implored us to give the restaurant another chance. You said you've been there for 45 years. My, the stories you must have. It was a pleasure meeting you last night.* To the cow(s) that offered my husband's and my steaks last night, I'm sorry. I'm sorry they did that to you. A little salt and pepper goes a long way but they denied you.* And, finally, to Jason and Valerie, the hapless diners in last night's saga. We were given MULTIPLE red flags and dismissed, scoffed and laughed our way past each one. We chose to be impressed by the restaurant's website and ability to make a reservation online rather than heeding other reviews here on Yelp. We walked through a near empty dining room on a Friday night at 7 and didn't think a thing about it. We didn't take the cue from our server that this evening was doomed when she was giving pretty clear signals from the moment we sat down and placed our drink order. And, still, when the 1st appetizer was sent back, instead of asking for the check and cutting our losses, we persevered. We pushed on stubbornly.

We all know any juice is already a substantial purchase and this option is available most likely to not pressure the customer although a tip option button when using a CC would be great to reward individual employees and a way to keep track of which shifts get the most tips charting their hard work and costumer satisfaction.Lastly, go checkout the Juice Bar!

So far so good. \u00a0And then I got home and ate the food. \u00a0 I ordered two things, and since I'm vegetarian for the most part, none of it involved meats. \u00a0So this review is based just on the vegetarian options. \u00a0I got a chilli relleno, and a veggie burrito. \u00a0The Chilli Relleno was an absolute disaster. \u00a0 First of all, it's much smaller than I expected it to be. \u00a0But I can live with that, but the filling was just horrible. \u00a0It's essentially filled with just a cooked egg that you get with biscuits from a fast food place for breakfast. \u00a0It tasted horrible, didn't go with the dish at all. \u00a0Halfway through the dish, I just took out the egg, and set it aside, and after that, the whole dish was just empty. \u00a0 No other taste at all, so it was basically just an egg and tasteless chilli. \u00a0Would've really preferred it if they would actually have some kind of flavor to the dish. Or if they actually filled it with maybe cheese or veggies. \u00a0They could break up tortilla chips and cheese into the dish, and it would be better than this egg based one. \u00a0I wouldn't recommend this at all, just a waste of money. \u00a0You are better off making eggs at home and eating with bread. \u00a0 The veggie burrito was a step up from the relleno, but so is biting your nails. \u00a0The burrito also lacked flavor, just didn't taste like much at all. \u00a0The burrito is definitely big, so there's plenty of it, but just seemed very plain to me. \u00a0I covered it with hot sauce at home, but that besides the point, because besides the heat from the sauce, this was a forgettable meal. \u00a0Obviously, it's from limited choices that I picked from, and I don't know how their meat options are, but I wouldn't really recommend this place to anyone. \u00a0I think I've had better food at fast food Mexican places than here. \u00a0 On the bright side, there is a frozen yogurt place two doors down, so you can drown out the bland taste afterwards with some frozen yogurt.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 50 reviews", "date": "2015-02-07"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nTim R.\n", "review": "i had my first meal at Guac today and it was great!

The service was fine. Our server was pleasant and patiently took the time to answer a couple of questions about the menu. Service was better than average for an inexpensive restaurant in a strip mall. \u00a0Also, the chips and salsa at the beginning were pretty decent. \u00a0Most importantly, it did not make us sick or anything, which along with outright rudeness would probably be my threshold for a one-star review. \u00a0So two stars, but the bar is pretty outstandingly low.Now the bad:1. The cardinal sin -- the food did not taste good. \u00a0We had two main dishes -- fish tacos and a \"vegetarian\" (more on the quotation marks below) chile relleno. \u00a0The fish (tilapia) in the tacos was too salty and WAY too greasy for allegedly grilled fish. \u00a0The tacos were served with the fish, shredded lettuce, diced tomato, and cilantro -- but not with the other usual accompaniments for a fish taco like white sauce or cabbage or lime. The chile relleno was filled with what seemed to be melted American cheese. \u00a0Really. \u00a0It tasted like the plastic-wrapped slices melted. \u00a0The breading was very heavy, and it was soggy on top because it was topped with a yucky mystery sauce (see below). \u00a0The accompanying rice was way too salty, and the smear of guacamole on the plate was roughly the quality of what I expect on Irish pub nachos, not what I expect at a place called Guac.2. The menu was inaccurate in troubling ways. \u00a0Most troubling, the extensive \"vegetarian\" section of the menu -- maybe 15 items -- wasn't. \u00a0Almost all the \"vegetarian\" items were accompanied by beans, which (to our server's credit) our server informed us were made with pork, even for the \"vegetarian\" dishes. She told us this when we double-checked about the non-meat status of the fish taco accompaniments. \u00a0Lying about the vegetarian status of your food on your menu is a pretty shitty thing to do to customers, many of whom feel strongly about this. \u00a0You can label a menu section as \"vegetable dishes\" and have them contain meat, fine, but if you label it \"vegetarian\" it damn well better be vegetarian. \u00a0Vegetarian means no meat, not just no big chunks of meat.Less troubling but still not great, the food descriptions on the menu were wrong. \u00a0For instance, the chile relleno was described as being topped with egg and a tomato sauce. \u00a0Our server informed us that the \"egg\" referred to the breading, not an actual egg. \u00a0We expected that the \"tomato\" sauce would be something like ranchero sauce, but it turned out to be some sort of mystery sauce instead.3. The mystery sauce was just gross.I honestly don't know what this stuff was. \u00a0I'm pretty sure it was not primarily tomato. \u00a0Maybe some sort of odd mole? \u00a0Anyway, it was a bright orange sauce that tasted like canned tomato soup mixed with vinegar, mayonnaise, and sugar. \u00a0It could have been an authentic chile relleno accompaniment from somewhere (I doubt it), but even if it was, it was just gross.

Initially, they had given me and my wife positive reviews, so we were interested to see what all the hoopla was all about. Well...upon further review, let's just say one would be wise NOT to buy into the positive hype surrounding the place. On the bright side, they have good guac. On the not so bright side...goodness...where do I begin? I'll start out by saying it was a light traffic day...maybe 4-5 other tables were occupied during our stay. The owner of the restaurant was casually sitting at a corner table, disengaged and disinterested in what was going in the restaurant. After we ordered our food, it took over 30 minutes before we received anything (besides chips). With such light traffic, I can't find any excuse as to the long wait. The lengthy delay became evident when we noticed our beans & rice, once delivered, were completely cold. Not lukewarm, but chilled and bland...as if they had been sitting out on the counter for a good, long while. On top of that, three of the four orders were incorrect in some capacity. For instance, my mother-in-law ordered corn tortillas with her meal, but was given flour tortillas instead. When she asked for corn tortillas a second time, it took another 20 minutes before they were brought out. Needless to say, she wasn't very happy...and felt completely devalued as a customer. For me, personally, I knew something was off when I ordered a diet coke with lime...and it came out a diet coke with lemon (granted, this by itself is a small deal). But the cold beans and rice was a first for me...and I've eaten out hundreds of times at mexican restaurants in the Nashville area the past 6-7 years. On top of this, there was no offer of a partial refund on any part of our order to account for the multiple mishaps. So, that was additional salt on the wound. Overall, the taste was medicore...definitely not anything special to justify the poor service. The prices are fair, but still...I have no clue why the ratings are so high with this place. Now, I assume we simply caught them on a bad day; however, it doesn't change the fact our experience was highly disappointing...and judging by what I'm hearing, the quality of service and management has dropped fast in 2015.

They have nice floor-to-ceiling murals and lots of kitsch and character. If you were to judge a place on decor, you would expect this place to be the bee's knees. But this is just another lesson in \"don't judge a book by its cover.\" (Or more precisely, don't judge a Thai Restaurant by its murals.)When we arrived there were 3 other people in the restaurant. By the time we got our menus everyone was gone and we were the only people there. At 7:30 on a Friday night we were the only people in this place. Not a good sign. The worst part was that the place was completely silent. Eerily silent. No background music, no chatter, nothing. Every word I said bounced off the walls and I'm sure our waiter could hear everything (and maybe even the kitchen staff). I was so put-off by the silence that we decided to take matters into our own hands. We opened up Spotify on my phone and started DJing our table. I would normally NEVER EVER do this, but there was no one else there so I was 100% sure that we were not pissing anyone off. We were hungry so we ordered the pork spring rolls. They came to the table fairly quickly which was a plus. The roasted pork inside the spring roll had good flavor, and the dipping sauce was good. Unfortunately the spring roll was mostly lettuce and cabbage and the normal delicious ratio was off. They were also really cold which made me think that they were pre-made and just chilling in the refrigerator.At this point I guess our waiter was totally bored so he decided to take a break. He got his own Thai ice tea and sat down at the table across from us. He took out his cell phone and I guess he was checking facebook/texting/anything that wasn't his actual job. Good to know that the ONE STAFF MEMBER feels totally comfortable to just kick-back on the job. At least go to the kitchen area or something. We \u00a0ordered the duck curry which was supposed to be roasted duck in red curry. What arrived was not duck curry at all, but a totally different dish, roasted duck. \u00a0The waiter realized what was wrong and said something like, \"yah, that isn't what you ordered...umm...I can take it back.\" But we were hungry and decided to just eat what they gave him. I would totally pass this off as a normal mistake, but honestly, how?! We were the only people there so they weren't busy. This is just total incompetence. \u00a0The duck itself tasted like it was made ages ago and defrosted. The brown sauce it was covered in was pretty salty, probably to cover up the freezer burn.I ordered the Pad Woon Sen with beef. The description said it was \"Bean Thread Noodles stir fried with our house Soy Base Sauce\" but didn't say it came with any vegetables. All of the other noodle dishes on the menu listed the vegetables that were in the dish, so I asked the waiter if it came with veggies because I didn't want noodles only. The waiter was unsure if this dish had vegetables (WTF?) and went to ask the kitchen. He came back and listed off a bunch of good stuff so I went ahead and ordered it.What I received was not Pad Woon Sen, but a pile of mushy brown stuff that was inedible. It was so salty I could feel the salt crystals burning into my lips, cheeks and tongue. This dish was hurting me!So I sat their pouting, feeling really bad. I was upset because I couldn't eat dinner and that our nice date-night out wasn't going as planned. The waiter looked in our direction and noticed that I wasn't eating and asked what was wrong. I told him that the dish was just way too salty and inedible. While he said they could re-make it, I was so pissed off at this point that we just asked for a bunch of to-go boxes. We packed up our food without eating it. While we did get the Scout Mob discount, we got no money off the check and no apology for the quality of the food or our experience.

My husband and I came here for lunch and we were really pressed for time. After being seated, it took our waiter about 5 minutes to come over with our waters and take our orders at which point we asked whether we'd be able to be in and out within 30 minutes. Our waiter rightfully pointed out that a bunch of tables had come in around the same time so it might be tight but he would do his best to get our food to us quickly and thought it would be do-able. Our waiter totally came through for us because in under 5 minutes of ordering, he had our spring rolls out to us and another 5 minutes later, our mains were sitting in front of us. He never once seemed flustered, nor did he seem annoyed or aggravated with us mentioning we were in a hurry. He also took care of the bill really quickly when it came time for us to pay, which we really appreciated as well. He managed to be efficient but friendly, which is not always easy to pull off and we both really appreciated it. Bravo!As for the food itself, it's not the best Thai food I've ever had (and seems somewhat \"Americanized\" to me), but the $8 lunch specials are good value, I think (and apparently if you're really pinching pennies and calories, most of the specials are just $6 if you forego the spring rolls... but why would you do that?!?). My husband ordered the Kao Moo Daeng, which is roasted pork in a sweet BBQ style sauce. It was pretty decent (the pork had a good 5-spice \"char siu\" flavor), but the one thing I found disappointing is that the dish was literally just pork, sauce and rice. No veggies or anything, which I always hate, because that doesn't seem like a balanced meal to me. I got the red curry with tofu, and I think that was a lot more successful. The broth wasn't as rich as some other places, but it was decent and above all, I appreciated that when I ordered it medium spicy there actually was some spice! Not enough heat to fry my tastebuds, but enough to add an enjoyable zing.Overall, this is a middle of the road Thai place in terms of the food, but the service really made a positive impression on me.

At one point, the waiter informed us that the kitchen wasn't taking orders for the next half hour because they were so backed up. We couldn't believe how slow and bad the service was.

Well my 11 year old son would eat chicken every day if we let him, so we decided on wings. We normally do the BW3 thing or Pizza Hut or some other place like that, but I decided we needed to try some local, less advertised, mom and pop type place. GREAT CALL! First off, while the place may not be all light up, don't let the look \u00a0of the building fool you. Its what comes out of that kitchen that counts. It took about 20 minutes for our order to be done, (and there were a few folks who came in after us and got their food first, but I am assuming they either called their order in or were regulars who order the same thing every time), but the wait was worth it. The wings, unlike most buffalo wings you eat, actually had meat on them. I like to eat hot foods, so my son got the mild wings and I got the hot wings. Hot?? Someone ought to check the recipe because I swear acid is one of the ingredients. They were really hot but I couldn't stop myself. Unlike most places that have hot sauce just for the sake of being hot, these were hot but with flavor. Amazing wings. This brings us to the sides. I got cole slaw, which was great, and the cajun fries were the best I have ever had. Even my wife liked the Slaw and she hates everything. That brings me to the Baked Beans...As I have said, my wife is the most finicky eater in the world. I let her try a small spoon of the baked beans, thinking she would turn her nose up and say a half hearted \"they are alright\". Wrong. After I gave her that spoonful and asked her what she thought, her eyes lit up like a kid that opens a present on Christmas Day and gets that Pony they always wanted. She then not only cleaned the bowl, but God as my witness, STARTED LICKING THE BOWL! By the time she got done, that bowl looked like it had just come out of the sleeve. I, in the 10 years we have been together, have never seen her react to a food like she did to those beans, EVER.While the biscuits were good, compared to the rest of the meal they were not on par with the chicken and the sides, but thats like saying that you have two players on your team, Michael Jordan, and \"only\" Kobe Bryant.

We had not only me and my parents, but my brother, his wife, and the 8 month old twins for their first high-chair experience.First off, I think this is in an old fast food place so it is tiny. The parking lot made me feel like a great white shark as I circled and circled just waiting for people to move. And when we went in we had to wait quite a while for a table to open up that was big enough to seat us all. But we weren't really in a hurry so no big deal.By the time we were seated, I felt like I could eat everything on the menu because I was so hungry. The problem with being that hungry is that you are going to be indecisive. They have the lunch menu going on but ALSO the BREAKFAST menu all day. i mean, what am I going to do? Breakfast sounds killer but so does lunch! Oh the stress.So I got an appetizer because I had never heard of it before...Htipiti. it was a spiced feta spread and it was FUCKING DELICIOUS. I haven't had anything like it before and we were all pretty enamored with it.So I chose the bacon lamb burger despite the fact that they said it had been featured on Food Network. The burger was ok but was small, a little dry, and there was no bacon. However, it had taken so long to get our food that I wasn't about to give it back. Plus there were ample fries to munch on. My dad got the full Greek sampler which looked good. My brother had some Cowboy burger that looked like a total artery clogging dream. All the food I tried from their place was good - standard diner far with a Greek twist. Overall I was pleased with this place.So why, if my lamb burger was not probably up to their usual standards, did I give them 4 stars? Well, the lamb burger wasn't BAD, it just probably wasn't their best. I am sure if I had said something they would have remedied it immediately, but I didn't because I wanted to just eat. \u00a0However, they seated us at like 1:30pm when the sign on the door said they were closing at 2pm for a holiday staff party, and they still seated our large party. The waitress had a lot of tables and busted her ass. And she was friendly and fawned over the twins and chatted with us when she could have rushed us out the door so they could clean up for the party. And we were there quite a bit past 2pm after all was said and done and never felt rushed. There was just something about the home owned, diner feel that made me feel at home.

Upon arriving I was seated fairly quickly. I was struck by how noisy and how bright the place was. The atmosphere felt more akin to a fast food restaurant, and I would not recommend it if you wanted an intimate or relaxing dining experience. After I was seated, my server disappeared and I was left waiting almost 15 minutes at my table (even though the restaurant was not busy). The server who eventually visited my table was very friendly, which partially made up for the wait. I ordered the vegetarian Greek platter and an olives/hummus appetizer. The olives and hummus appetizer was tasty - the pita was warm and plump, the hummus was not special but good nonetheless, and for the price I thought it was a good deal.The vegetarian platter, however, left a lot to be desired. The moussaka was meh, ok, kind of tasted like some frozen gourmet meal. There was a small dish of vegetables in tomato sauce that I actually thought was quite tasty. The rice was a huge no - it tasted like the kind that comes pre-cooked in a bag. There was a cheesy potato side dish that was tasty - but then again, it was almost pure cheese, so hard to mess up. The portion was big - I had enough to take to work for lunch the next day.As a Bellevue resident, I'm glad to see this place here. The more variety of restaurants the better I say. If you go here, you will probably get something that tastes decent. You will probably not get something amazing though. The service is just ok, and the atmosphere is diner/fast food joint.

I am glad I did. A greek place in Nashville that actually serves something other than the standard gyro, rice, salad, falafel and hummus.The location on Old Harding Pike used to a be Mrs. Winners Chicken place, so it does not have the most ample seating. Fortunately, the staff is very good at clearing tables and getting people sat. While I waited for my to go order, I saw a few people come in and sit down to wait and the longest was about 2 minutes. Having the manager out on the floor is a definite plus when you want to be able to sit down and eat.My thrill, even though I did not order it, was seeing Pastichio on the menu. As I mentioned above, it is hard to find more than the standard gyro place fare in Nashville. The reason I did not order \u00a0the pastichio was the fact they also had Lamb Souvlaki.First, the negative. The gyro is presliced and grilled on a flat grill. The gyro has a nicer flavor than most of the flat grilled gyro I have eaten in the past, but I wish they had gyro off the spit, as it tastes so much nicer that way.On the positive side. The lamb souvlaki is nicely spiced and succulent. Lamb can taste pretty bad when it is not prepared correctly, so souvlaki is a good food to judge the quality of the restaurant. This is nice and tender and has a wonderful flavor.The greek dinners comes with either french fries, rice pilaf or Dina's creamy potatoes. Of the three, I would definitely pick the last. The creram sauce is similar to avgolemono soup with cream added. Something I ate had a hint of cinamon, which really made the flavors pop. I am not sure if it was the souvlaki or the tzadtiziki, but the two together were quite beautiful. I talked to the manager about saganaki (Greek flaming cheese), which they unfortunately do not have. He mentioend the Avgolemono soup and threw in some for me to try. Although I am not a huge fan normally, the avgolemono was the best I have had in Nashville.I need to go back and try the pastichio some time and see if it is as yummy as the food I had tonight. i was also supposed to try the baklava some time.In summary, if you are interested in real Greek food beyond just gyros, try Athens.

Oh well...Service is hit or miss. \u00a0Everyone is friendly but you could end up waiting a long time, even if there are few people in the restaurant. \u00a0On the last few visits, I have given up waiting for the bill and just stood by the register waiting for someone to check me out.Atmosphere was pretty fairly described by someone else on here: it's a former Mrs. Winners. \u00a0I can forgive cheap atmosphere if the food is good, but this place just doesn't cut it. \u00a0 \u00a0How was this place featured on the Food Network? \u00a0I just don't get it!", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 20 reviews", "date": "2012-05-28"}, {"rating": "2.0", "name": "\nM R.\n", "review": "I've experienced both incarnations of Athens both the original on Franklin Pike and this one in Bellevue. I can't say I've been impressed with either, which is surprising since they rated a visit from a Food Network show. After many visits I suspect that Athens is just one of the \"lucky ones\" that got a little buzz (probably mainly b/c of their late night hours and breakfast over in Melrose) and they now are just coasting on the hype.I've had the gyro meat as part of a sandwich and alongside eggs for breakfast. Both times I found it dry and like some sort of pre-processed strips of meat. I've had the Spanakopita which I'd give mixed reviews, since it seems to either be hit or miss. I've sampled a few other items off friend's plates from their pretty extensive menu, and I can't say that any of them have been impressive. Things often seem to have a dried out, re-warmed sort of texture and taste. The service at Athens is hit or miss, but most of the servers there don't make you feel rushed to finish and free the table, which is a good thing. Sometimes that lack of rush borders on being ignored though. While the waitstaff in general are friendly enough, the (owner?) management is not so cordial. Pricing is a bit high on some things for the portions and quality, but Athens is an ok place to try the more complex \"homestyle\" Mediterranean dishes if you don't want to leave Bellevue. Just don't expect them to be as good as you may have eaten at other restaurants.

I had a great experience with both food and service at the Franklin pike location so today a co-worker and I went to the Old Harding location for lunch.When we arrived, we were looking for a parking spot and drove around the building. We happened upon the executive chef (I know this because he was wearing his chef's jacket with the title stitched into the cloth) opening/messing around with the man hole cover in the driveway, which looked to be the sewer cover and was also smoking a cigarette. \u00a0Smoking I can handle, wash the hands, all good. However I wondered what an executive chef would need from under a manhole cover.Having faith that he would adequately clean his hands, or at least, let someone else cook we decided to enter. \u00a0The place was not very busy, only 4-5 tables were full and we were told by a waiter to go ahead and sit and he'd be with us in a minute. No Problem.Except, that was the last and only time we were spoken to or even acknowledged for the entire 10-15 minutes we spent sitting at the table. \u00a0The table behind us was checked on and supplied with needed items. Two tables to the right of us were also checked and re-supplied. All while the waiters walked completely around and past our table. we didn't even have menus, so there was no wondering about if we were ready to order. \u00a0To beat it all, a guy who came in after us and sat in a far off corner was brought a drink, a menu and was having his order taken as we left, by the SAME server who asked us to sit down.When we got up to leave another server was standing RIGHT beside our table. He didn't ask what was wrong, try to stop us, nothing. It was as if the staff here could care less about you or your business. (Unless I suppose you're one of the lucky few who got there before us.)All in all, I will most likely never go back there and not to the one on Franklin Pike either. If it was a large chain like O'charleys or Logan's and I received bad service I'd try out another location. But since the same folks who own and operate the Franklin Pike location own this one, I see no reason to support a total lack of quality control and management.I posted a small rant on this on Facebook as well, since Yelp was doing maintenance and I was ready to give this review. A friend who saw it said that they know these people and basically they do not care about reviews or opinions anyway. So, I'm glad I did not take the time to complain while in the place.

My favorite will always be Addis Red Sea in Boston, but Mesob in Nashville comes fairly close! Located a little out of the way from my usual dining circle in a tiny strip mall, Mesob is a no-fuss type of place. The decor consists of what appears to be old banquet dining tables and chairs mixed in with cheery paintings and artifacts from Ethiopia. I was hoping that a restaurant named Mesob (after the traditional Ethiopian table) would actually have them for seating. But they didn't, and that was tad bit disappointing.We had the beef Sambusa, the vegetarian tasting plate and the Qey Wot. I was so happy with our choices. Everything tasted so good!

For this, we toss them in the oven at home for another few minutes to tighten them up. Also, the crust is more on the softer side. You can eat the crust without a back of beverage and also is sweet and savory. They do make a good pie.

(i learned this when i had zachary's chicago-style pizza in berkeley -- i couldn't appreciate it until i decided not to think of it as pizza at all, then i realized how amazing it is).ok, castrillo's. let's start with the crust. oh, the crust. it has never failed me, never been burnt, and never been underdone. it's fluffy and a little bit sweet, and light in your mouth, and unlike my favorite pizza in san francisco, where i never ever ate the crust, i can savor this to the last bite. the crust is awesome. and the toppings have been great in every version i've tried my usual is pesto pizza, with onions and feta cheese. it's truly perfect. when i'm in a meat mood, sausage and pepperoni, both of which are high quality meats (bad pizza sausage, which is used in lots of chains, is not edible -- but good pizza sausage can make your day). the hawaiian was great too, and i tried one that had bacon and banana peppers on it, which was interesting. and yes, they're all cheesy, so if you don't like a lot of cheese on your pizza, tell them to go easy with it. but really, i can't imagine the argument against cheesiness. and the bread sticks are fantastic, they must be made from that magical crust dough -- and the feta cheese sticks?? oh. my. god. they are so good it's amazing that you can get something like that for five bucks, though with pizza, it's a bit of bread overkill, so you might want to get a side salad to go with them and make a meal of just that. (the side salad was totally edible, if ordinary, but eating salad makes me feel just that much less guilty about eating too much pizza).oh, and they also take their magical bread and make cinnamon bread sticks, which they deliver with a little tub of that sugary topping that makes cinnamon rolls so good. for under five bucks for something like eight of them, you can save them for breakfast. heat 'em up, put on the icing and yum.and if you need dessert, they even have new york cheesecake from the cheesecake factory if you want, and reese's peanut butter cheesecake, but i'd suggest the homemade brownies. yes, delivery can take up to an hour, but ji just plan ahead. it's worth the wait.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 67 reviews", "date": "2010-04-05"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nCourtney B.\n", "review": "Castrillo's is the neighborhood pizza joint of Riverside Village. \u00a0There's no indoor seating, so it's a pick up and go or get delivery kind of place, but I love ordering from there whenever I'm visiting in East Nashville. \u00a0They offer your typical pizza place toppings and pies as well as a couple more creative options. \u00a0The seafood pizza is in reality as crazy as it sounds, definatly for the adventurous. \u00a0I remember when I picked it up after ordering, the employee behind the counter greeted me with a 'so you're who ordered that pizza'. \u00a0Not really sure if that was to him a good or bad thing but he was jovial when he said it. \u00a0As good as it is, their pizza is not what makes them stand out to me. \u00a0They're Feta Cheese sticks are so delicious, and the amount they give you is amazing, you could really order that instead of a pizza and be full. \u00a0They offer salads, sandwiches and other pizaa shop type food but its their wings that I will recommend to anyone thinking of eating here. \u00a0They are hands down the best I've had in Nashville so far. \u00a0First of all they're huge, nothing like the wimpy chicken wings you get in most places. \u00a0I can easily say they're twice the size of your average wing, and they cook them until they're so tender the meat falls into your mouth. \u00a0They only have three flavors, but they're all so tasty you could eat them every day. \u00a0The mild wings are a dry rub which is deliciously unusual and come with banana peppers sprinkled on top, the hot wings are wet and come with jalapenos and the bbq come with pineapple. \u00a0I'm craving them again as I'm sitting here writing this and am contemplating driving over there right now in the cold to get some.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 170 reviews", "date": "2008-12-21"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nCory P.\n", "review": "Castrillos was a friendly and quick pizza option. \u00a0The pizza crust is the best part and they load their pizza with cheese. \u00a0My only complaint is that the toppings were scarce. \u00a0But besides that it was, overall, a great pizza with great service! \u00a0Much better than the chain pizza joints on the NE side of town.", "location": "\nPalatine, IL\n", "exp": " 66 reviews", "date": "2010-05-15"}, {"rating": "2.0", "name": "\nDan E.\n", "review": "Well, I was sucked in by some favorable reviews, too bad.

A couple minutes later, he seated us. We sat there for 15 minutes and no one even came to get our drink order. Now understand, from my table, I could see 9 employees, 5 of which were standing in a corner visiting with each other, and there were only 11 tables with people seated. So now here we are, 20 minutes into out hour parking and we have not even been able to get a glass of tea.

I wanted a tasty meal that had not been in sight of a fryer and which would not write off my evening or break the bank.Joe's Crab Shack fit the bill. It's not downright cheap, but compared to London prices for seafood it seemed very reasonable. We started with crab nachos to share. While not out and out dreadful, this was a pretty bland dish and the crabmeat got lost in the mix rather than adding another level of texture and flavour. My tip - skip the starters!For a main, we shared two steampots - the Arctic Bay and the Ragin' Cajun. Both were absolutely delicious and full of meaty claws, lobster, prawns, clams, sausage, sweetcorn....all steamed to perfection with wonderful herbs and spices that really made their presence known.This is not fine dining - you will wear a bib, you will make a mess and a bottle of beer is probably your best bet to accompany rather than a dainty glass of crisp white. The service can be hit and miss and the venue is huge and sometimes a little rowdy.This is not cheap chain dining - while this is a chain, the prices certainly aren't rock bottom. I dare say there are places when you could get, for example, steamed crabs or oysters cheaper if you had the time to investigate further.But the quality of the seafood we feasted on was to be admired and it certainly made a welcome break from the heavier, richer fare we indulged in on our trip round the southern states.

The staff member told us that we had been wait-listed and then quickly made her exit.

I finally went with a group of 4 co-workers yesterday. We mainly went for some drinks but ended up ordering food after a couple of hours.The first thing we noticed as soon as we walked in was this strong odor in the air. It smelt like stale smoke/food/sweat all combined. \u00a0You get used to it after a little while or that might have just been the alcohol dulling my sense of smell. Either way it wasn't an issue after about 30 minutes.I started off drinking vodka/cranberry. It was happy hour so my drink was in a tall glass and supposedly with a double shot of vodka. \u00a0I'm no alcoholic, I can almost count on both hands how many times I drink in a year. I had 5 drinks within a 4 hour period and had a buzz but nothing like I should've had after the equivalent of 10 drinks. I don't think I was getting double shots. I even confirmed it was happy hour with the bartender. \u00a0The rest of my group drank beer and they got their 2 for 1's in 2 separate glasses. After an hour, we moved from the bar to the patio. We were immediately greeted by a server. Nice guy, very happy but very forgetful. We ordered another round of drinks which came in a timely manner but then we didn't see the server for another hour. We had to go back inside to the bar to order more drinks. Not sure what the problem was as there were only 10-12 people in the whole place at the time. Once the server finally returned we ordered some food. Two of us ordered the buffalo wings and two of us ordered cheeseburgers and fries. The wings came out quick, like 10-15 minutes but it was a half hour before we got our burgers and fries. The wings looked and tasted damn near perfect, I'll get those next time. They were crispy fried and tossed in the sauce with extra sauce on the side. Yumm. The burgers were greasy but still good, cooked to a perfect medium-well. The buns were a little soggy but whatever. Unfortunately, all the grease had puddled on the plate right under the fries so they were extremely soggy and nasty.The prices were right on with every other bar & grille in that area. The wings were $9.99 and the beers were in the $2-$3 range. My mixed drinks were around $7 and the burger n fries were on the special of the day for $7.99. \u00a0The server was quick to come around and drop the checks off, before we were even half-way done with our food. I had to go back inside, yet again, to get another round of drinks before leaving.All in all, it's just OK. I mean, I would go back again but, only because its right across the street from my work.

I noticed immediately that the prices had climbed significantly since my last visit; $11.99 for a Reuben and fries in Nashville? Other items were priced comparably. When I was ready to leave my father went up front and asked for service; the young man up there came in and took our order and about 25 minutes later our food came. The Reubens were cooked well and the cole slaw was simply okay.

About 5 minutes after we ordered our waitress came back to tell me they were all out of the Ribeye. Ok, no problem. I then decided on the Teriyaki Chicken, which comes with a veggie-pineapple skewer and rice. I also added my Lima Beans again as a side.

THEN about 3 minutes after that for the THRID time she comes BACK to tell my fianc\u00e9 that the onion rings he ordered as a side had to be changed to something else because they only had 3 onion rings left. Ok. Do they have anything on their menu? As they were discussing his next choice of side, she then informed me there was also no more pineapple for my skewers. And she said it as a side-comment, like it didn't even matter! She giggled and walked away. Even after all this, we were still holding on to some hope the food was going to be good. Umm, nope. Once our food showed up, my Teriyaki Chicken had the pineapple-less, burnt skewer and no rice in sight. We waited about 15 minutes after our food arrived before we saw our waitress again, in which we told her about the rice. She said, \"Oh yeah, it does come with that\" and walked off.

Calls and emails went unreturned, so did our business.5) If you have a really good waiter, they will be gone and never back there the next time you're there.6) If you sit on the patio and there're 3 waiters working, you will be told that the reason service is so slow is that the 1 waiter you've got is also handling the largest table inside. \u00a0If you happen to go inside there will be one table of 6-8 people and another table or two of 2 people and no particular reason evidenced to why there's no way to get a second round of drinks before happy hour ends.7) If you have an event that will pay off immediately and not over the course of 4 -6 weeks in profits, you will receive a call in under a day. \u00a0Learned this when we had contacted them about how much money our group was spending and one of the group also contacted them for a private party for work.That's about that. \u00a0The food is average, there're a couple of vegetarian options and they're ok but not good bar food. \u00a0on a 2-4-1 they serve you both beers at once, which means they're warm by #2 unless you're a hardcore alcoholic. \u00a0I, and the group I'm with, want to love this place (it was home for years in spite of the service) but we've consistently been treated like we're an imposition, and the place is always less than 1/4th capacity when we're there so it's not like we're taking up space, and our bills and tips are high enough.That's my review, mostly seen from the patio as that's the reason we went to Sportsman's. \u00a0We have not been back in a while.Edit 10/20/2010 - service was good, still don't know why we went back - get there before it starts to suck again / current good outdoor waiter quits.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 573 reviews", "date": "2010-09-27"}, {"rating": "1.0", "name": "\nDavid R.\n", "review": "Sunday night. \u00a0They're out of a third of the items we ordered. \u00a0Establishment? \u00a0Run down, smells like stale everything. \u00a0Server was nice and apologetic, which saved a zero-star rating.", "location": "\nLorton, VA\n", "exp": " 9 reviews", "date": "2013-11-17"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nAli B.\n", "review": "The back patio is great.

I expected a little bit more, as it was bland and the heirloom tomatoes weren't that sweet. \u00a0We shared three sides: lobster mac and cheese, onions and mushrooms and the broccoli rabe and carrots. \u00a0The lobster mac and cheese wasn't as tasty as I expected it to be. \u00a0I think they missed some seasoning in that batch. \u00a0The other two veggies were outstanding, with the onions and the mushrooms being my favorite. I could have just eaten a side of that. \u00a0The second night we started with the Oyster Rockefeller. \u00a0Be warned, the oysters are not sitting on a bed or seasoned breadcrumbs, it is SALT! I completely ruined my oyster by sprinkling some on top. \u00a0I had the same steak the second night(can you tell I am a filet girl?) and it was equally delicious. \u00a0Before dinner, I had a Belevedere martini and our server was so nice to get me blue cheese stuffed olives, even though I was told they didn't have them(I wish I remembered his name as he was fabulous, and sang me Happy Birthday at well. \u00a0Dined on May 15th around 7:30). \u00a0The dessert was a chocolate ganache with fresh whipped cream and it was the most delicious dessert.

Nice blend of varietals. \u00a0I would like if they poured a better sparkling in the glass, however. \u00a0My only negative would be it gets so dark in there at night that it is hard to see your plates, hence taking salt for breadcrumbs. \u00a0It would be nice to have a little more light. \u00a0I would recommend the restaurant again for sure. \u00a0If you are attending during a conference, please make reservations. \u00a0There were people that were attempting to walk in and no tables were available. \u00a0Oh, the library is a perfect to have a cocktail prior to dinner.

I do apologize for my CRS moment as I have just drew a blank on his name. I asked for him each time. He was from Cairo where my main base was during the Army. With this, we clicked and talked about days through the country and North Africa so attention was way above par. 5 star.The menu is rather limited, which is a good thing. IMO a large menu offers different fare selections at mediocre quality. Limited menu means less options but great food. Naturally I had the fish dish others steaks. All side items like the lobster mac was spot on.The check tally grew with the wine. The wine list was very good. Black Tears was the choice. Decanted and pouring on! 5 bottles later we were all in a happy mood. If you have a question here they have a person on staff to suggest make and vintage. Question about your meal, heck the chef will come out.Overall I think the Gaylord itself is way overrated, however Old Hickory is excellent and good as it gets.FYI, make sure you make reservations well (I did 3 weeks) in advance. This will A) get you in and B) provide you with seat selection of choice if you know the restaurant layout. My suggestion is make a reservation for the patio corner.

My Kansas City strip was medium-rare as ordered, but tough and dry as leather (more like a tough Timberland working-class leather than a soft, buttery Connoly leather). There was no marbling at all (nor was there any fat whatsoever)...what grade of meat was this??? At $44, you would think it would be a dry-aged prime, but I suspect not. The steak was hardly edible even when drowned in the steak sauce (2$ extra for two tablespoons!!).

However, we had come for dinner, so it wasn't obvious where the hostess was. Eventually we found her at another entrance, but not before ordering drinks in the lounge. We would've been seated earlier had the hostess asked us how many were in our party instead of just assuming there were only two of us. Frustrating, but what are you gonna do?With drinks in hand, we sat down at our table. That night, we were feeling a little obnoxious for some reason, but that didn't seem to bother our servers and the manager, who all seemed to take it in stride. I mean, if you're spending all of this money, you can take a little abuse, right?With respect to the reviewer who thought the dinner took too long, it's a restaurant that serves starters, cheese plates, steak a la carte with family-style sides, and dessert. The experience is not meant to be quick; it's meant to be enjoyed at a measured pace.All of the food was excellent; the cheeses the fromager selected on our behalf were fresh and rich, the New York Strip was cooked perfectly medium rare, and the \"signature\" popcorn ice cream was a nice touch at the end. The wine selection was decent, though the first couple of bottles we selected were unavailable. Most of the bottles were overpriced if you purchased them outside the restaurant.What I liked the most was actually the storytelling behind the food. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu, and would explain the options with charm and enthusiasm. When I asked about the popcorn ice cream, he told the story of how it came to be, a 5-minute novelette recited.

While, for someone who has not experienced many steakhouses, this restaurant may seem impressive, for someone who loves great steakhouses, this was a very disappointing experience. First, the steakhouse insists upon itself. Their menu brags of a sustainable menu and hand-selected producers of beef... okay, but who is doing the selecting? They brag of an extensive cheese menu... that isn't very extensive... and their wine menu is both overpriced and under assorted. Now, before you dismiss this review as that of a snob, let me assure you that I simply make these points to emphasize how much this \"signature\" steakhouse insists upon itself, only to be quite unimpressive. The service was adequate, and the server seemed interested in accommodating our requests; however it took a very long time to get drink refills - when I am paying $24 for a GLASS of wine, excuse me if I would like it to be prompt. \u00a0Both my wife and I were impressed with our first course, she had their Ceasar salad and I had the Lobster Bisque soup - which I confess was very good. Our steaks and sides were another story. My wife ordered the filet and I ordered the NY strip - I am being God's honest truthful when I say that we have had better-prepared steaks at a Texas Roadhouse. Just awful. My medium-rare was more like a dried-out medium-well and her filet was so crusted with salt that she actually had to cut off the top of the filet just to eat the rest. Unfortunately, because we had tickets to the Opry, we didn't have time to send either meal back. Their cabernet reduction sauce was a waste of money, even at just $3 extra. It's bland flavor wasn't even sufficient to make my beef-jerky steak tolerable. I cancelled a reservation at Fleming's Steakhouse to eat closer to the Opry on the night of the show - HUGE mistake. We were both so solidly disappointed that as we were walking away from Old Hickory, my wife said that we might as well have eaten at the mall food court next to the Opry and saved our money to prepare a steak dinner at home. \u00a0 $208 that I will never see again - don't make my mistake. Make a reservation elsewhere and enjoy a better meal... I recommend Fleming's or Morton's in Nashville. \u00a0Then again, if you like the way that a Ryan's steakhouse cooks their food, and you simply want to pay 10x more than you would at a Ryan's, Old Hickory is the place for you.", "location": "\nBallwin, MO\n", "exp": " 4 reviews", "date": "2012-04-23"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nGregory B.\n", "review": "Pricey but well worth it based on the ambiance, quality of the food, great wine list and exemplary service.

The menu wasn't that expansive, the choices were primarily various steaks, with one choice of fish and one of chicken. All the food is ala carte. So if you only ordered steak, that is all you ate. I had grilled Salmon, which was the best i've ever had, however $43 for Salmon just isn't right :( \u00a0minus 1 star.

For sides the table ordered, Blue Cheese Mashed potatoes, some weird but cheesy mac n cheese, grilled asparagus, and green beans. The sides were good, but extremely over priced. Some folks ordered salad, I'm sooooo glad i didn't go that route. The salad consisted of huge chunks of lettuce was barely no dressing.

We honestly were not expecting much, and the place was very busy when we got there, plus we had about 1 hr and 15 minutes to give, so we were in no rush.We first arrived at 5:30, and got the last open table. We sat down and were quickly greeted to get our drink orders. We asked for a beer each and a water. The waitress seemed eager to get them to us, and she placed the order and asked to see our IDs on her return. We got them out and had everything ready. 15 minutes later we got our beers, but no water. She took our order. We asked for the burgers to be medium cooked, and she said company policy requires them to be well done. We figured we had to do it because we were already there, so whatever. She then made sure we had \"10 minutes or so\" to spare for our burgers to be cooked. It was 5:50 at that time and our flight boarded at 7 so we figured sure. She then assured us our water was on its way.The water never came. We finally started nursing our beers to save them for dinner, assuming we would never get the waters. The place was beginning to clear out, so we figured we would be getting our food any time. 6:15 rolls around and we still have no food, and 2 tables beside us have sat down, ordered, paid, and left since we've placed our order. The waitress was at the register, so my husband went to ask her about our food. She said we were the next ticket. Ok cool. But now we were pressed for time, as we still had to get to the other concourse.At about 6:22 the manager comes out to speak with us and gave us a lot of attitude. She said, \"you know you have to be patient, these burgers are made to order, and your ticket time was 6:13.\" Number 1, the burgers are not made to order, they are made well-done because they are frozen. Second, we placed our order at 5:50, not 6:13, so our waitress forgot about us and placed the order when my husband approached her. BULLSHIT. We were now nearly about to miss our flight, and we still had to pickup food. My husband said if he didn't see someone or our food by 6:30 we were leaving. No waitress in the restaurant to be seen, and no food at 6:30, so we got up and left, without paying for our half finished beer. About 10 seconds later and we are being chased down the concourse by our waitress, suddenly visible to her. She exclaimed, \"it's not my fault\" and told us we were going to be made to pay for our beers. My husband went while I went to Wendy's. Miraculously the burgers were done and given to us \"free of charge\", but I had already ordered Wendy's. So now we had 4 burger meals and we were out $40. Then we ran to our gate, ate burgers on the floor, and nearly missed the plane.If you have a flight to catch, a place to be, or any respect for yourself, this is not the airport restaurant for you.
