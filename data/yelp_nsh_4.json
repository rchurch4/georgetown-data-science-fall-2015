They just didn't taste very good. I would discourage a friend from ordering them. I didn't try the nachos but they didn't look special. The brother said that the jalapenos weren't spicy.

They have quite a few flat screen TV's with various sports and teams on each. We sat at a table requested the Gator game, they immediately changed the channel for us and put the sound on as well. They have quite a few beers on tap, we tried a few local brews that were excellent. The menu is mainly \"bar food\" but it was delicious. I had \"The Raven\" sandwich and my husband really enjoyed his Rueben sandwich. The location is prime. It's not right in the middle of \"everything\" so its not super crazy but its only 1 block away from 2nd Ave and all of the craziness.

I thought to myself, \"This must be a mistake.\" After I took the receipt to the guy who waited on us (he was real cool about it) he explained that $7.00 IS the special on a pitcher. HOLY SMOKES!

The kids' meals are a great option because the portion sizes are a bit smaller but still have the similar options to the adult menu. The kids can also get chicken nuggets or a burger if they like.

The icing on the cake here is the personal service. The Owner takes the time to greet you, discuss the menu options and help you build your plate in a very patient way. Rather than rushing you through asking you what you want, he takes his time and is very personable and seems geniunely grateful for your business.

They were fairly crowded for a Wednesday night, but luckily we were able to snag a booth that had just vacated. There was an awesome beer selection and really great music. This was definitely the right pick for dinner tonight.We started things off with an order of Bottle Caps: fried pickles, fried okra, and fried jalapenos with a thick ranch dipping sauce. Everything was lightly battered and crisp. It also tasted really fresh, like they had just picked it up from the farmers market today. The jalapenos were pleasantly spicy, but not overpowering. The creamy ranch was the perfect condiment, more like ranch dip than ranch dressing.I ended up ordering the Pig Roast sandwich, which was pulled pork, jalapeno slaw, and pimento cheese on a sweet potato bun, topped with a Carolina mustard barbecue sauce. It also came with waffle fries on the side.Waffle fries are probably my favorite type of fried potato. They were just crisp enough, but still soft on the inside. The seasoning was also really nice.The sammich was also quite delicious. Much to my surprise and my delight, I could actually taste a little smoke in the pork, although it was a bit mushy for my liking. Thankfully the addition of pimento cheese made up for it. There was also a nice bite from the red onion, but not much slaw. It did add a good crunch though. The sweet mustard sauce was a nice touch too. The sweet potato bun was actually reminiscent of cornbread in a lot of ways. All in all, a commendable sandwich.I'm really glad we tried out M.L.

Rose on 8th since it first opened, and it's one of \"my spots.\" Here's why I like it:AMBIANCE: They offer a cozy, casual, almost dive bar feel, but unlike many dives, this place is clean and non-smoking. The walls are plastered with music memorabilia, bumper stickers, neon beer signs, and owls (per their logo). If there's a big game on (playoffs, MNF, etc.), expect game audio, but otherwise, enjoy great tunes via the digital jukebox. There are two outdoor areas, a smoking patio and a beer garden with picnic tables. Also available: Big Buck Safari, Pacman, and arcade basketball.FOOD: These are, in my opinion, the best burgers in Nashville. They use hormone- and antibiotic-free local beef, and the patties are well-seasoned and cooked to order; 9 times out of 10, my medium patty is a perfect medium. You can build your own burger, or choose one of their specialty burgers. I almost always go for the Nashvegas: a beef patty with pimento cheese, crispy onions, BBQ sauce, on a sweet potato bun. Are you kidding me?! This thing is life-changing.They also have some of the best chicken wings in town. The classic Buffalo (available in four heat levels) is great, and their verde (green Tabasco, scallion, cilantro) is unique and just as good. Choose from their housemade thick ranch or bleu cheese for dipping.Other highlights on their mostly pub fare menu include regular waffle fries (a la Chick-fil-A), sweet potato waffle fries, chips and queso/guacamole (though their salsa isn't very good), and their bottle caps (battered and fried okra, jalapenos, and pickles) served with thick ranch.BEER: They offer a good selection of draft and bottled/canned beers, with plenty of local and seasonal options. They run a 2-for-1 special on Thursdays, which means this place is absolutely packed, to the point that I avoid it.SERVICE: The servers and bartenders, for the most part, are friendly, attentive, and hardworking.

By my standards,it's done!I've been going to this place at least 4 times a year for the past 4 years. It's really gone to the terlit in just the past 9 months.Here's a summary of my most recent visit:1) Beer menu is out of date, so you need to rely on your server to give you accurate information about what is available. Good luck on that one. Before you even set your heart on a beer, be sure to ask if it's even available. Even then, don't get your hopes too high, because there is a 60% probability that they'll come back and tell you that the keg \"just ran out\". Translation: your server (however nice) forgot to tell you that they ran out of that days/weeks ago.2) On our recent visit, I asked the server what they had on tap for stouts. He tells me they have Nitro Milk Stout and a Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Stout. I ordered the latter, as it sounded interesting. The problem is, it's a high-gravity ale that tastes just like straight bourbon. The server (at a place that advertises itself as serving \"craft beers\") thinks that \"Stout\" is a description of the STRENGTH of the beer, not an actual STYLE of beer. When I go to the bartender to ask about the confusion, he just stares at me like I've done something wrong. He stared at me for about 20 seconds after I asked him to clarify what might have gone wrong. When we leave, said bartender ironically yells out for the whole bar to hear: \"Have a Nice Day\".3) Food is never prepared properly. Before this recent visit, I got the \"Villy Cheesesteak.\" It was shoe leather on a 3-day old bun with mutilated mushrooms. On this visit, I got the brisket roll-up. It might have been good, had it been served warm. It came out ice cold, accompanied by ice-cold fries. It may be the case that the cook prepared my order first, and then had to seat it under the heat lamp while he overcooked my wife's burger. Seriously, why ask people how they want their burger if you're just going to brutalize the meat by overcooking it EVERY TIME. This is the 3rd time we've gotten overcooked burgers. While the preparation was the cook's fault, it may be the server's fault that my food was so cold. I remember thinking that it took an inordinately long time to get our food when the place really wasn't that busy.This place used to have really nice, and competent staff: especially the bartenders. The food, especially the burgers, used to be great. They used to advertise that they bought local beef. Since they don't advertise that anymore, I'm guessing they don't buy local, grass-fed beef, and consequently have to cook the snot out of the meat to kill any possible pathogens. It's anybody's guess why they routinely overcook the meat.I can forgive a few things. But when the service is routinely so-so, the food is always so-so, and then the staff is rude, I think I'm done with this dump.The place always had a dive feel to it, now it's just a dive.

A got a simple cheeseburger and it was unbearably bland, even the nachos we ordered as a starter were lacking. The beer selection is pretty good, not any better than somewhere like 12 South Taproom but I am trying to find a few positives about the place. Another downside is that ML Rose has a seat yourself policy. If you go during a big game or during their 2 for 1 night expect to stand around for an hour, annoying other patrons by hovering over their table to try and snag it when they leave.

My experience is never overly great or horribly terrible. It is always in the middle.Three things are important to me in regards to a restaurant: Food, service, decor/ambiance, and in that order.Food: Good bar food. Not great, but pretty good. I love their black bean crunch salad, loaded waffle fries and their wings. Never disappointed with those for the most part. When it comes to wings, I am a weirdo. I prefer the wing to the drum stick. On one occasion I ordered the 6 piece wings. I asked if I could have all wings and no drum sticks, or at least the majority be wings and my bf could eat the drum sticks. The waiter said no I could not. He explained that the wings are pre-portioned to be 3 and 3. I was a little surprised that they couldn't accommodate that and said ok whatever. When I got my wings, there were, drumroll please.....5 drum sticks and 1 wing. When he came back over I was like really dude? And laughed it off. You could tell he was kind of embarrassed but he still brought it out to me and it wasn't like they brought me a new order. Anyway, not a big deal tho.Service: This is where the restaurant needs some improvement. They always seem understaffed! I have never in the, probably 12 times I've been here, ever had speedy service. I've never had speedy service even when they are not busy. One time I watched our food sit in the window for 12 minutes (yes, I timed it). And not only our food, there was a lot of food that just sat there. On that particular day, my bf and I were in a rush and thought 45 minutes would be enough time to order a burger and salad and eat. WRONG. I finally said we have to go and to put our food in to-go containers. I watched her walk over to the window, grab our food and put it in styrofoam containers. No apologies for the wait, nothing. The place was not even busy. So if you are looking for great service, you will not like this place. Decor/ambiance: Great! It's a cool place to hang! Lots of bar stools, booths, picnic style tables outside. They have some arcade games, trivia on Tuesdays, big TV screens, and lots of fun decor hanging on the walls. My only complaint here is that my bf and I came here to watch the first football game of the NFL season. They were playing the game on every single TV, but with no sound. There was some teeny bopper 90s crap playing. We asked out waiter if they could switch the music to the game, he said the owner does not let them do that. He explained that when there are multiple games playing they can't pick one to play the sound, we explained that this was the only game on and that it was on every TV screen. We also explained the only reason we came was to watch the game. He said if enough people complained maybe the owner would change it. Never happened...wah wah.All in all, decent food with a cool vibe. Service generally sucks.

So since their beer selection was basically the same as way too many other bar/restaurant places, it really was going to come down to their food. \u00a0After looking over the menu, for a place that is supposedly known for their burgers, they didn't have a plethora of burger options. \u00a0Basically all the generic options, bacon cheeseburger, mushroom & swiss. \u00a0And while I wanted to try the burger, I'm on Weight Watchers, so I opted for the Grilled Chicken Wrap with a side salad and waffle fries. \u00a0My boyfriend got the bacon cheeseburger.Couple of things on the food.The menu does say it, but my boyfriend just overlooked it, but all the burgers come \"fully dressed\". \u00a0So just know that from the get go. \u00a0There was no \"that burger comes fully dressed, is that okay?\" from the waiter when we ordered. \u00a0So when the burger came, my boyfriend was a little turned off as there were some items on the \"fully dressed\" burger that he doesn't care for. \u00a0But the burger was cooked to medium and he did eat it all. \u00a0So it obviously was okay.I'm not a fan of pickles. \u00a0Like. \u00a0At All. \u00a0And surprise surprise, UNDERNEATH the waffle fries lie a pickle. \u00a0Nowhere on the menu did it say that all sandwiches (wraps included) came with a pickle spear. \u00a0Now typically pickle juice taints the entire plate and all the food ends up having the pickle taste. \u00a0Luckily, this pickle wasn't that way. \u00a0So I was still able to eat a few of the fries, but not very many.The waffle fries were not salted in any way. \u00a0Which I guess is okay if you like lightly salted fries because then you can add the salt at the table. \u00a0But the fries where not hot when we got them so no salt would stick to the fries anyways.I got the Grilled Chicken Wrap and it was a beast of a wrap. \u00a0However, they don't know how to wrap a wrap. \u00a0The end of my wrap was not folded properly and chicken juice and goodness was causing a mess. \u00a0Despite that, which you get from most wraps these days, the wrap was REALLY tasty and I did enjoy it. \u00a0I ate half and took the other half home where my boyfriend enjoyed it as a late night snack.The side salad was good. \u00a0I liked their house made vinaigrette. \u00a0My only thing with the salad which was only spring greens and tomatoes was that it came in this tiny bowl. \u00a0So there is no way to pour the dressing on and then mix the greens without making a huge mess. \u00a0I ended up just grabbing a few greens and then dipping them in the dressing on the side.All in all it was an okay experience. \u00a0It was a bit loud. \u00a0Our waiter didn't check in on us nearly as often as I would have liked (we waited almost 10 minutes for him to pick up our check to pay). \u00a0There isn't any beer there that you can't get somewhere more convenient or that has a better atmosphere. \u00a0While I'm glad I tried M.L. Rose because so many people have been hyping it up, I left feeling underwhelmed and wondering what the hype was about. \u00a0It's a frat filled sports bar with a craft beer selection you can find at a plethora of places around the city (including on Broadway) with okay food, bit high prices, and typical service.Nothing to blow your hair back or wow you. \u00a0But the Grilled Chicken Wrap was a standalone winner. \u00a0Probably won't ever go back. \u00a0But glad I went to check it out.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 22 reviews", "date": "2013-06-10"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nJoshua P.\n", "review": "Nash Vegas is one of my go to burgers around town! \u00a0Great place for a lively evening.", "location": "\nAmarillo, TX\n", "exp": " 13 reviews", "date": "2014-06-19"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nKyle H.\n", "review": "Good place to eat.

First off, it's kind of an upscale sports bar, is how I would explain it. They've got craft beers, some food options, the interior itself is clean and eye-appealing. Bartenders were pretty cool. A few video games tucked in the back as well as pool tables. Clientele seemed pretty young. Not sure if it was just the night we happened to come in, but it was super frat boy central. Lotttsss of North Face, people. Lots. The patio was a bit small and cramped, and people who were even MORE drunk than me kept stepping on my toes and running into me. But the weirdest thing, and really the reason I knocked it down from 4 stars, were the cheese fries. I was completely baffled by what was put in front of us. I don't know if we had just ordered it wrong or something, but they came out as a sad bowl of waffle fries with what looked like orange nacho cheese on it. What the hell? I thought it said loaded? It was the saddest bowl of fries you'd ever seen. I would have asked but our waitress seemed kind of busy and we didn't see her for awhile, so we just ate them anyway and said screw it. Still...I just can't wrap my brain around this abomination of traditionally delicious cheese fries.But all in all, it was definitely an A-OK experience.

Don't get me wrong I have eaten there before, their Super BLT is the bomb but I have not ordered a burger.

After the 3rd bite I had to ask the waitress if this was normal. It had gone from med-rare to absolutely rare in the middle. She somewhat gagged and took the entire plate back which was ok because the fries were tepid at best anyway. She promised a fresh batch with the 2nd go around.

My parents came into visit from Texas for two days today and we did a whirlwind tour of Nashville and around 6 o clock we were thirsty for a beer. I knew it was two for one night at ML Rose and so I raved to them about how many great beers they have on tap and that it would be perfect. we initially walked up to a two top standing table and we had been there all of 5 seconds when a waitress with two beers in her hands (not a huge tray that needed extra space mind you) gave my dad a huge sigh and rolled her eyes signifying that he was in her way and he very politely excused himself (this was unnecessary since he was about as close to the table as one can get without sitting on top of it)... all three of us thought hmmm that was a little over the top but oh well... I had a chip for a beer from a couple of weeks ago so I asked the bearded bartender if I could use it for a beer (he looked at me as if i was the biggest moron on the planet and let out a super condescending yyyyeeeeees). I then asked him for the Son of a Peach for my mom and a draft wheat beer for my dad.. he plopped two tokens down for the free beers and I informed him that I just wanted the two beers since we were going to have one and head on to a show so essentially those are the two for one. He gave me the most disgusted look like \"how dare you only want to drink one beer\". There are three beers sitting on the bar now so I ask which one was the peach beer to which he replied \"If you put your nose up to the beers and smell them then you will know which one is the peach one\" I wanted so badly to tell him what i thought of his attitude but my parents were with me and didnt want to further ruin the mood. For some reason I still tipped him.. for what I do not know.. he treated me as if I had been there for an hour asking for water with a certain amount of ice cubes and extra lemon or something not three simple beers... so we take our unknown beers to another standing table and another server comes by and asks us if we wanted to get any food, we explain we were just having the beers and she ROLLS HER EYES JUST LIKE THE FIRST SERVER DID. My parents and I are looking at each other like what is up with the staff here.. so extremely rude for no reason. We came there to relax and instead all three of our blood pressures were higher while we were there than before we got there.. the opposite of a good time and my mom's beer was christened by my nose since i had to sniff out the peach.. utterly ridiculous.

They do quite a few things pretty well. I don't think there is any one exceptional quality about it but put together enough nicely done items and you end up with a great little neighborhood pub.So lets talk about boozy drinks that resemble a Wendy's frosty. Of course I'm talking about bushwackers, except they don't have bushwackers here, they have taliwackers. It seems the same in almost all regards but replace all the rum with vodka and you end up with a very different experience. I've had some here that I almost ventured to say I like more than a bushwacker. Other times I've had them and they almost seemed to be curdling aka gross. The inconsistency is a little annoying but when you get a good one, man is it ever good. The draft beer selection is decent. The bottled beer selection steps up the game beyond that pretty well. It also helps that they have drink specials almost every day, even on the weekends. As for the food, the burger at melrose is good. It's deceptively huge thanks to the enormous patty hiding under the bun and toppings. They cook it a perfect medium rare for me so no complaints about it being over/under cooked. It's local beef from some farm I can't remember right now, perhaps in Franklin, but it is sufficiently lean and not too fatty. All in all I would put it down as my 5th favorite in Nashville.Unlike others, I wasn't very impressed with the waffle fries. I couldn't help but think they were sysco or some other processed food. They did not taste hand/home made to me. It's not like you could even think much about fries if you managed to make your way through their elephantine burger so who cares.On a final note, I feel this review would be incomplete if I didn't mention the giant velvet rottweiler art adorned behind the bar.

I was drinking Bud Lights all night, but also sampled my friend's White Russian, which was very good.Now let's get to the important part: the food. We all ordered food, and I was excited for my taste buds because this place boasts some of the best burgers in Nashville, all made with natural local beef. I ordered the Blue Cheese Burger (bacon, blue cheese crumbles, grilled onions) and waffle fries.Food came out pretty quick, but let me tell you....it was worth it no matter how long we waited for it. It was truly the most amazing burger I have ever had in my life. The blue cheese crumbles were perfectly melted on the burger, it was juicy, the bacon was crisp...it was literally heaven on a bun. I'm not a huge fan of fries but the waffle fries were pretty run of the mill, made amazing by me drenching them in Tabasco sauce and then dipping them in the spinach dip that Chris had ordered, which was TO DIE FOR.I went the following night, on a Thursday, when they have 2-4-1's starting at 4PM. Other notable specials are Happy Hours Mon-Fri 4PM-7PM ($1 off apps, liquor, wine and beer), $2 domestic drafts on Saturdays, and $2 drafts all day on Sunday. They also have trivia on Tuesday where you can win up to $50.They have a brunch menu on the website, which looks AMAZING. Brunch is served Saturday & Sunday 10AM - 3PM and I'm really considering flying in next Friday evening to sample what must be a delicious treat in the AM.I give Melrose a hearty 4 1/2 stars.

Parking can sometimes be an issue, but \u00a0you can turn on the street right by the lower parking lot and go up to the top level for more space. The menu is your typical bar food with prices that you would expect. But it's definitely good food. I'm partial to the loaded fries basket. The burgers and wings are decent as well. Service can be hit or miss, sometimes it's great sometimes it's not good at all.

While tourist after tourist line up at Hattie B's Midtown location (no shade; I can throw down at Hattie B's), odds are you'll only find locals (or, friends of locals) at this Bolton's location. It's small. It's decidedly pre-hipster Edgefield. It still has a good amount of regulars who seek out a hot hot plate on a Saturday night. These are all great things and add to the Bolton's mystique. The 'problem' is coming from a growing number of people searching for a more 'authentic hot chicken experience.' It's gumming up the works. The kitchen can't keep up with orders. Bolton's runs out of food (forget getting dinner after 8 on a Friday or Saturday) and the newbies ask question after question at the window while growing numbers of regulars grow impatient behind them. On my last visit, four of us walked out.Here's the thing: keep it moving. Newbie's, do your homework. Know what you want to order. Order it. Pay with cash. Keep it moving. Bolton's, stock your product. You're getting more and more popular with a crowd that comes from outside the neighborhood. Meet the demand. Bolton's isn't Hattie B's. It's teeny tiny. It can't keep up the crushing crowds Hattie's handles on the regular. Therefore, both patron and business need to meet in the middle and decide how to best handle the restaurant's size and supply issues.Consulting aside, I see the root of the growing pains: the food's really good and the word (beyond locals) is getting out. Helpful hint: take whatever heat level you're used to and go one down here. Unless my order gets routinely confused, I find that the mild still has a respectful level of burn to it. I can't imagine going higher. That can't make for a very fun next couple of days. As mentioned earlier, this Bolton's is very small. Use your imagination... and now go smaller. Although there are tables, unless you enjoy elbows and other body parts in your face, take it to go. But, a leg quarter plate with mac & cheese and potato salad is just what the doctor ordered after a long week. Well, not the *real* doctor. A real doctor would be horrified at what you're about to consume. We're talking about the food-as-therapy doctor. That's the doctor that would order this food. The upshot of the supply/demand conundrum is that the Bolton's experience has gotten a bit less... stressful. I've lived in DC, New Orleans, Philly, and Chicago and I've gotta say: there were times I was a wee bit concerned at Bolton's. It's small (have I mentioned the size), the Edley's trickle hasn't come this far east on Main and the later the night gets, well, yeah. So, there's that. Bolton's is presently at a crossroads. I don't want things to change so much that the charm and feel of the location goes away. But something's gotta give, as the experience within the past four months has been on a downward slide. And if you're new to Bolton's, please please please please please do your homework beforehand and keep things moving.

They are three pieces of chicken each, skewered like a kebab on, as the name implies, a stick. First bite... wow. Incredible. The outside is crispy, the inside juicy, and incredible flavor everywhere. Be warned, the medium was really hot. Feeling the burn and my eyes starting to water, I set out for the hot. It was hot. Really, really hot. But I was amazed at how much flavor it had. I have never tasted a food with this level of heat that still held so much flavor. It was insanely hot but not at all overpowering, and it made me wish my tolerance was higher so I could see how good their hottest flavors taste.

Since I'd decided that we had to try the duelling hot chicken places while we were in Nashville, we walked here from downtown on New Year's Eve for supper. When we found it, what we found was a cinderblock building that reminded me of being back in Detroit: signage painted on the side. We walked in the front door to find a few picnic tables, a TV... and what appeared to be the front of a house. There was a door with a knocker and a sign saying to knock when ready to order and a small window (closed) next to a snack-shack menu board. We had been given a heads up to try the whitefish here along with the chicken, so we basically knew what we wanted and went up to the door and knocked. The window opened and a man looked out to take our order. (He also took a phone call in the middle of my ordering - it's a laid back place, to say the least). We ordered a quarter chicken and whitefish with coleslaw and potato salad. For drinks he offered us \"Orange, grape, or Powerade. Or you can walk to the gas station and buy something there.\" I contained my laughter and we both had an orange pop. The prices were really low. I don't think we spent $25 on the food (though I was sure to leave a good tip for anyone working NYE, as anyone with a conscience should.)Once our order was placed I was looked up and down and the guy behind the window said \"You want me to make it hot?\" because we hesitated, he asked \"You ever been here before?\" and when we admitted we hadn't, even though I protested that I do like spicy food, he said \"I'll make it /mild/.\" (But I do think that he gave us some spice - I'd compare the heat we got to the medium at Prince's)When it came out - wow. It's hot - this isn't a food you want to try unless you like a lot of spice. The base paste for Nashville hot chicken is cayenne and lard (we googled it). It is also delicious. Both meats came with sliced pickles, which complemented the heat. The potato salad and coleslaw were pretty unremarkable. I read later that we should have opted for the mac and cheese and baked beans, but as we didn't try them I can't confirm or deny these rumours. The whitefish was better than the chicken, so I'd definitely recommend it if you pay Bolton's a visit. I just had a blast, but you probably do need a sense of humour to come as a tourist at night. I didn't feel unsafe at any point, but it's obvious the neighbourhood has seen better days.

Maybe a little touch greasy, but definitely, we did enjoy. Savored every spicy, lip-tinglin' bite of that dry-seasoning in the crunchy coating and that moist bird inside it. We ordered a leg quarter and a breast quarter, \"extra hot,\" and yeah man, that was good and hot. Just right. We ordered, as well, a hot whiting sandwich, and hot chicken on a stick, as impulse orders there at the end. Good fish sandwich with everything- hot sauce, mustard, pickles and onions. Great chicken on a stick! I'd do it again. Sides of greens and macaroni and cheese were alright, but the stars were absolutely the spicy chicken and fish.As there is very little seating available on site of the shanty, we took all that goodness back to our lodging at top speed and enjoyed it all up with a cooler of beer out by the hotel pool.

It's more of a medium; medium is hot; and hot is what I would call extra hot. When I order buffalo wings, I always get hot, so it's not that I'm a pansy or anything. For me, the medium was an enjoyable spice level at about the same spice level as a hot buffalo wing (perhaps a bit spicier). But for my wife who usually orders mild buffalo wings, the mild here was way too spicy for her. Fortunately, you can get a \"no spicy\" version here, which the guy behind the counter generously offered. So if you don't like spicy, DO NOT GET THE MILD - ask for no spice.

As a Chattanooga native, I grew up going to Choo Choo Hot Fish, and it's memory (sadly it is long gone) is still the standard by which all such places are forever judged.On all accounts, Bolton's comes through with shining colors.

And the 'sandwich' itself is a huge meal. Its two 10\" pieces of whiting, breaded, deep fried and bathed in their special hot sauce (hey, its Hannuka, its tradition to eat foods fried in oil - you can find your own excuse.) It comes between two woefully inadequate slices of white bread, complete with pickles, onions and a dollop of mustard, and it's Good!But its more than the fact that its spicy to perfection (I sweat a little but not enough to ruin my shirt), the heat and the flavor go hand in hand, so the hotter it is, the more flavorful it is. The food really makes you want to get it hotter each time you come back.The one drawback to the place is that the authenticity that makes it so great also means that the whole dining area consists of 4 four person picnic tables, \u00a0and 1 eight person table, so it can sometimes be a challenge to find a place to sit and eat.In fact, now that I think of it, someone reading this may want to go to Bolton's and take up some of that valuable seat estate and make me wait to eat next time I go back.I take it all back.

We decided to wait another time to have dessert due to our full bellies. 2nd visit:It was a Monday, the daily special was coconut chicken and grilled pork chops. I had ordered to go and also brought a dessert, carrot cake! The coconut chicken with mango peach salsa... ugh no words to say... IT WAS THAT DELICIOUS!

After my most recent trip to Copper Kettle's brunch, I realized that with a few notable exceptions, buffets kind of skeeve me out. And for good reason, I think, since the issue with buffets is that there is always going to be quality control issues, as not all of the food can be equally fresh, and if we eat with our eyes first, my eyes were telling me that I didn't really want to eat much of what CK was offering.Truly the only reason my husband and I came here is because we had a gift certificate for $30. Also, we were hungover. 'Nuff said, right? Most of what was on offer was really unappetizing to me, and the eggs benedict I picked up actually had a firm yolk, which is just creepy. Also, I question the safety of leaving hollandaise sauce out at room temperature rather than making it to order. I may be an adventurous eater, but I generally don't like to run the risk of salmonella... My husband had better luck with his eggs, and I'll admit that once I put a bit in my mouth it tasted fine, but I REALLY didn't want to put it in my mouth. Should brunch be filled with trepidation?I think a lot of people justify the $16.50 (PER PERSON) pricetag on the buffet because so much food is on offer, but I'd rather that CK made fewer dishes and focused on making them well. There are a lot of cold antipasti type dishes which never seem appealing to me, and while the prime rib carving station was fine, I think my favorite thing on offer was the pork tenderloin with mushroom gravy. We did get one order of the made-to-order Belgian waffles with the coconut cream sauce and while the topping was delicious, the waffles themselves were kind of limp and flaccid. I bet you didn't know waffles could be flaccid, but they can! I just really felt like the food on offer wasn't of a very good quality and even though we had a gift certificate, it all kind of felt like a bit of a rip off. I'd have been much happier with one decent place of food rather than a mountain of uninspired/questionable fare. I've never been here for lunch, but I feel like I'd much rather hit up Loveless or Monell's if I'm looking for Southern cooking.

Someone needs to tell the cook eggs aren't supposed to be brown and crispy. \u00a0My friend's \"cherry waffle\" was actually a run-of-the-mill buttermilk waffle sliver with some kind of pink cream cheese or whipped cream (not sure which) garbage on the side. \u00a0Honestly, her waffle was so small they should've provided us with a monocle or something just to prove they plated any food at all. \u00a0Also, I assumed \u00a0there would be cherries cooked into the waffle, but umm, no. \u00a0Oh, don't worry, they added a single maraschino cherry to the center. \u00a0I guess that was for flavor? And aesthetics? \u00a0At that point I was over it, but my friend wanted to try the buffet after the crappy waffle experience. \u00a0I had a bite of a muffin, more crunchy eggs, bacon, but over all it wasn't any better than Shoney's. \u00a0Oddly enough, she also had a glob of what she claimed to be lasagna, but I wouldn't have touched that with someone else's fork. \u00a0Who puts lasagna at a breakfast buffet? \u00a0The bill comes. \u00a0I get charged for a buffet, which by the way, was $17. \u00a0Clearly a mistake. \u00a0Right? \u00a0No. \u00a0The waiter came back and said that technically anything you order is charged as the buffet. \u00a0Then why did he make a point to mention the waffle and omelette separately?

I am obviously not a connoisseur of Korean food, so while I can say that I've never eaten anything here that I actively disliked (which doesn't sound like high praise, but kind of is coming from me), I have never been blown away by anything either. I am not a huge kimchee fan (sacrilege, I know!), but I've always found the stuff here tolerable, though not very spicy at all. In fact, I think that's the issue I've always had with the food here: the flavors are all kind of flat. Maybe I'm just used to the insane layering of flavors that you get from Thai and Vietnamese food, but I have found the dishes here to be very one-note. They aren't bad tasting by any means, but they aren't very exciting to my palate at all. I never find myself craving the food here, and given that Kien Giang is right down the street at something like a third of the price, I have a hard time justifying spending my money here.But again, I know pretty much nothing about Korean food and this place is always packed so I am assuming this place does a relatively faithful interpretation of what the food is supposed to be like, and it's just not really my thing.

My husband and I \"discovered\" Wholly Chow on our way to an early Saturday morning meeting. They'd just been open two weeks. \u00a0I asked the server what kind of sausage they use...When I got the answer to that, I knew things were going to be okay. Guess what? The food was outstanding. I ate 2 sausage patties from a small producer in Cookeville and 2 eggs (over medium well--nobody ever gets this right and they did), cheese grits (that rival the best I've had), a huge drop biscuit (slightly sweet and did not need anything like butter on it), fresh (yes!) fruit, honey butter, jam...$7.95. Every bit of it was really, really good. Freshly prepared, just right. Since I had the patties and I had asked, the owner brought me a link to try. Yummm. I see why he brings that stuff all the way from Alabama--or was it Mississippi? One of us, and usually both, have been back to this restaurant at least once a week since that first time and we've tried out a lot of dishes (I don't know if the owner knows that or not--he hasn't been involved in our dining experiences.) I will say that one lunchtime, I had the black and blue salad and it was to die for. Amazing what \u00a0can be done to a lettuce wedge, bleu cheese, and some medium rare sirloin. At that meal, my mother ate a fish platter of some sort . She was ecstatic so I tasted. Perfect. Last week, at breakfast, a friend said she was eating the best ham she'd ever tasted. I could make a meal of the dirty rice.And--we've never had cold food. 1. It's NOT A CHAIN, People! It's owned and operated by somebody who wants to serve good, fresh food.You're not going to get homemade crab cakes on a baguette anywhere else...nor crab cakes Hollandaise that are that good unless you leave town. 2. That restaurant is in a \"restaurant desert\" and is a welcome oasis. A location in a strip center is not a bad thing. (I recall the best meal, anywhere, I've ever had and it was in a strip center on Maui. Yep.) 3. Any time a local person opens a restaurant and they're not \"chain-indoctrinated,\" they have to grow and change and tweak...Maybe we wish for a little more ambience, or hot-n-tot service.

My family and I went for brunch last Saturday. I had no problem with the ambiance. I was thrilled that even though they had a television on, the sound was off. And for once, the music was very low, real \"background\" music.The service was excellent. The food was really, really fresh - one of our party is extremely fussy about her omelettes, and said it was lovely. One of us asked whether the chef could accomodate a \"no-egg\" omelette due to allergies, and he created a wonderful substitution with loads of spinach, vegetables, potatoes, and sausage. (The sausage by the way was wonderful.) The coffee was delicious, and they have Perrier, which is a big plus in my book.The biscuits, home made, were delicious. Not gummy at all, and just sweet enough. I'd have preferred plain butter to butter with honey in it, or at least a warning, but I'm sure if I'd asked, they'd have brought some. My one criticism would be that the food was all cooked with a fair amount of oil, but I'm going to ask for minimal oil next time, and I'm betting it won't be a problem.The fixings are fresh, still a real rarity in Nashville breakfast places. And there are so few of them here! Noshville Green Hills, with it's low health scores. Athens, which can be great or meh depending on day and staff mood.

In my own personal experience I've tried the blackened catfish, shrimp and grits, Cabana fries, sweet potato biscuits, wasabi shrimp and jumbo lump crab cake. Clearly things got pretty serious on our table. If I could've found a way to unstuff my stomach to try more I would have. As I mentioned everything was extremely delicious but I found the biscuits, wasabi shrimp and shrimp and grits to be OUTSTANDING. hands down the best shrimp and grits I've had and I've been trying them left and right to see if anywhere else can match. Eight months in and several plates later - no comparison. For the drinks I believe I tried a few happy hour drinks but the real standout here was the martini sampler. Each one was delicious, (even the chocolate that I was quite nervous about) strong and well prepared. If it's one way to make me fall in love it's through good dranks.

When you walk in it feels fancy yet casual. There were four of us that went here on a Sunday and we were asked whether we wanted to sit inside or outside.

The pitcher was enough for all of us to have a full glass which was great with us and it was a better price than all four of us buying a single drink. The pitcher was $16 whereas the glass was $5. The server then came to get our food order. Sundays are 2 for 1 pizza specials so the rest of the people in my party took part in that. I decided on just a caesar salad. There were two sizes to the salad. Either a full or a half. I ordered the full size. The food came out within a reasonable amount of time. My salad was just the right size. i asked for extra dressing when I ordered the salad and they actually put more dressing on the side for me. I used to be a server for five years so I know a lot of times that even though you ask for something extra it doesn't always come out with the food. I am always impressed if everything comes out at the same time. The dressing was great and yes, you can mess up caesar dressing. Two sourdough croutons came on top of the salad.

We had three options for our courses, and to start we had the warm baby spinach salad with mushrooms and bacon vinaigrette. It was extremely tasty and delicious, so we were excited for the remainder of our dishes. Unfortunately, that was the best part of the meal.The price fixed menu looked so good we had trouble deciding which options to get. Since we had 3 people at the table, we were able to try each of the entrees; I had the corn crusted tilapia with spicy black beans and grilled corn, while my friends tried the peach glazed pork loin and gnocchi with summer vegetables. My fish was not good at all. The corn crust was extremely tough to cut through and had no flavor at all. Even adding Tabasco butter didn't help it. I ended up peeling it back and eating the fish only because it was like a protective exoskeleton. Not great. I didn't even finish the fish because it was bland. The beans luckily had a good flavor, so I ate those instead. The peach \"glaze\" on the pork loin was more like a peach jelly; it was thick and overtook the flavor of the meat. But my friend said the meat was cooked well at least. The gnocchi was the best dish of the night (I'm thinking because of the cream sauce) but even that was just decent, not a stand out dish. For dessert, the menu boasted a vanilla bean pound cake with fresh berries and I was excited to try that. Meh. There was not much flavor and I've had better pound cake at the grocery store.And lastly, the reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 3 (because of the salad and some decent parts of the dishes) is because the wine pairing was terrible. The chardonnay was good, but it went downhill from there...the pinot noir with dinner tasted like it was low quality and the moscato with dessert was so sickeningly sweet it was way too much. Plus my friend had to beg for her drinks, our waiter was terrible about getting her the appropriate drinks with her dishes.

First off, it is one of my most favorite happy hour locations in Nashville. They have $4 glasses of house wine for happy hour-- and not just red or white, but house pinot, house merlot, house chardonnay, etc. They also have martini specials which others like, but generally I steer clear. I do enjoy the lemon drop. Important to note: their happy hour is EVERY DAY. That includes weekends, folks. Friday, Saturday, Sunday. If you want to hang out and gab with a girlfriend at 4 on a Sunday with a cheap glass of wine, you can do it here. OK, moving on. The wait staff is hit or miss. I have had really exceptional servers here. Like the sweetest waitress who went to the Sunset Grill across the street to borrow bitters (they were out) so the bartender could try to make this drink I had asked about. But I have also been left for half an hour with empty water glasses, empty beers, etc., ready to order, even when there were very few occupied tables. So it really depends on who you get. I'm rarely in this place at peak hours, even when I come for meals. OK, on to the food. It's good. The lobster mac and cheese is fabulous. I tend to do tapas style here and order a mix of smaller dishes. The field greens salad? Incredible. Wasabi shrimp? To die. The pies are really amazing as well. Not to mention the atmosphere of the entire restaurant. I particularly love the back bar area and the front patio when it's nice out.

There is nothing ostensibly wrong with Cabana, but it's never the place I think to go. I find it so uninspiring. The only reason I came here was because it was a work dinner and the person organizing it is (for reasons that are unclear to me) in love with this place.It may sound silly, but one thing that bothers me with local Nashville restaurants is when they don't update their menus seasonally. Prior to my most recent visit to Cabana, I had probably been here about a year ago, and yet nothing on the menu had changed... and it was about the same as when I had been here a year previous as well. I guess I get bored and like it when places that skew upscale change things up.I ordered the venison as my entr\u00e9e and it was fine - cooked well, had decent flavor, but it didn't really wow me. The desserts we ordered and split were pretty mediocre, in my mind, and I wouldn't order either of them again, including the much lauded banana pudding. I think people who are impressed by the food at Cabana are ones that have never had a truly stunning meal. It's for wannabe foodies who like to think they enjoy the finer things in life but really just want to be surrounded by pretty people.The reason I didn't give Cabana 2-stars is because while I think overall what it attempts to do is pretty \"meh\", I do think the prices are really reasonable. If you're looking for a place to get fancy drinks for cheap, Cabana definitely delivers. Most of the girly cocktails I enjoy swilling are $5 or $6 (including martinis) which is pretty much a steal anywhere.

My latest experience was last night. My wife and I recently participated in the Passport Restaurant tour of Hillsboro Village and now have coupons to use at restaurants through the end of August \u00a0Cabana participated and their coupon states \"20% OFF entire bill\". \u00a0To use our coupon, my wife and I decided to go to Cabana last night and take her parents with us. We only went because of the coupon and took 2 other people who would not have gone if we didn't have the coupon. Well our nice waiter informed us that we could only use the Passport coupon for 1 persons meal. We were surprised and disappointed. He said he knew we would be frustrated but he could not do anything about it. He said people had been coming in groups of 10 to get 20% off their entire bill with their Passport. Our thoughts were, Cabana just had 9 more people come to eat there which they may not have had their business if not for the coupon. So they would have given 20% off but made 900% more business. The waiter would have had a nice tip and everyone would leave enjoying themselves and wanting to come back again. Instead they only let you use the coupon for one meal. So instead of 10 happy people, they had a group of 10 people surprised and possibly annoyed. I know we came excited to try Cabana again and save a little money but we left as 4 disappointed customers who will think twice about returning.I also think the back room at Cabana is insanely loud when it's full. You can't hear the person sitting right next to you. For a place that clearly caters to large groups, I feel they need to do more to make the experience more pleasurable for everyone.

The food is delicious... the process of getting it is incredibly painful. I have been to The Perch three times in the last two weeks and each time the process is the same... at least they're consistent about what goes wrong each time.1. Ordering needs to be easier for the customer and for the cashier personnel. You place your order by listing the ingredients in the crepe, omelette, waffle, etc. This is confusing to both parties because there are multiple crepes with similar ingredients. The cashier often gets confused about what the customer wants VS what's on the menu. (PB+banana, or PB+banana+granola+honey?) Since ingredients have to be listed out AND cross-checked, this process takes lots of TIME. It would be much faster and less confusing if each crepe were numbered, or if each crepe had a name (the sparrow? the bluejay? the turkey? the pear-ch?). 2. Job duties, their assignment, and their priority needs to be more clearly defined. Sometimes there isn't anyone at the cash register and customers wait. Sometimes a customer has asked for a tea bag for their hot water and the guy who responds first wipes down a counter in the back, delivers some silverware to a customer who doesn't have food yet, etc before responding. Sometimes food is waiting to be delivered while the guy responsible for this delivery is wiping down a counter. These are the things that happened to other customers while I waited in line... it took 15 minutes for the cashier to process 3 people ahead of me. 4. LayoutPlace the coffee next to the fixins. This will prevent customers who have already ordered interrupting the line. Get bigger cups for water. This will prevent customers from having to get up/down during their meal- something that would be especially convenient since there isn't much space AND would help improve throughput. Prevent coffee from running out and/or getting cold- establish a process for checking whether the coffee needs refilling. You could do this based on ordering volume per hour, or just simply start with a reasonable increment of time depending on customer volume... Not sure whether this type of thing is already implemented or not, but it doesn't seem to be since I've experienced process problems with the coffee on multiple occasions.I love these crepes, both savory and sweet. The coffee is delicious when it's hot and available. I will continue to come back until the process gets too painful.

I then left it for a few more weeks thinking that my anticipation may have been a bit much and that I may have jumped in to early. So over two weeks later I went in to try the crepes.... I made two different orders one sweet and one savory. AND.... Dry crepes and guess what, NO espresso COFFEE!

It's just THAT good.I love Nashville's food scene. I love that you can default to as good of an option as Calypso, which is what I do. My fiancee and I love Calypso and aren't strangers to the eastside location. It's a pretty chill atmosphere and most of the workers bring their own personal flair to the job making you feel pretty cool for coming in. You walk in and smell the rotisserie chicken and feel the action of a group of employees putting together meals for the guests. It's usually pretty busy but they turn the food around quickly.My favorite which we get almost every time is the Lucayan Salad. We also usually split the Beans & Three. Calypso has some great vegetarian options without making you feel disappointed that you wanted to vegetarian that day. The Lucayan Salad, however, is the best salad I've had in Nashville. Oranges, Rotisserie Chicken, and Almonds make it a filling and delicious option any time. Also, their fruit tea rivals Baja Burrito for the best in town.Pros;The Lucayan Salad is the best.Cons:I don't really like staying there to eat. There's nothing bad about eating there that I can point out but I just prefer to take my salad home to eat.Overall:This is one of my favorite go-to's in town.

Lettuce, black beans, tortilla chips, cheddar, tomato, red onion; chicken beef, or rice, and a side of BBQ sauce.

The perfect amount of sweet and spice.House Salad dressing. Simple: Pour it on everything.Fruit Tea. Some of the best in town. When in Rome.Calypso Bar.

As of the last several years I pretty much get the same order... I am sure the people at that location that have been there awhile would recognize me just by my order... 2 loaded nachos w/ rice, no onions (since you switched from green), EXTRA bean dip (because the portions vary so), EXTRA cheese (see bean dip) and the vinaigrette in place of the barbecue(it gives me heartburn).

Last night however, was the final straw. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My wife brought the order home (and was so kind to do so)... the extra bean dip was in containers on the side?????? ... and the other toppings were just non existent...just a pile of chewy chips, a sprinkle of rice, I don't know that there was bean dip actually ON the nachos and \"some\" cheese....I called the night manager and told him the situation and that I will not be back, because I think they should know that their employees are losing them business.

Granted, I'm not a huge margarita fan, so as far as they go, I did enjoy this one. The happy hour menu has great specials on a few food items. I had the Cilantro Lime Steak tacos. They were quite good. It was definitely enough food to count as a light dinner. The meat was juicy and tender, and the flavor was tangy. I was happy with the corn tortillas; they appeared to be handmade and were thicker than the standard ones you get in the grocery store. My husband got the Tequila Lime Chicken tacos, and they were also really good. By the time we left, which was around 6:30, the place was slammed. The happy hour on Wednesday goes until 10:00 pm, so I can see why they were so busy. I would like to go back for brunch or a regular dinner.

I know that bigger parties can be a handful so I definitely keep that in consideration when ordering and commenting on the service. However we had two waitresses who just did not seem to be on the same page about anything. I got grilled by one waitress on how I ended up with a drink I had ordered with another, which is okay (I've worked food service before and know how hectic it can get) but the whole exchange was weirdly accusatory and awkward. I had the Casa Perfecta margarita ($10) which was part of the 2-for-1 deal. It was good, but pretty small (and honestly, kind of weak) for a ten dollar drink. I was pleased to learn about the happy hour deal but after \"cashing in\" my coin, I never received my second drink so that was disappointing. I wasn't hungry so I didn't order food, but I had a little of my boyfriend's chicken tinga tacos which were really good. Still overpriced though, in my opinion (I've had just as good if not better for less). I will say that what was really thoughtful was the waitresses automatically offering to split the check.

It's in the Gulch. It's not old Nashville. It suits the neighborhood. It... is what it is.I think when patronizing an MStreet restaurant (particularly in The Gulch) you have to accept some things in order to have a good time. You need to realize the truth of everything I wrote above. You need to understand what it is you're walking into. This isn't your abuelo's taqueria. This isn't a fast, casual eatery suitable for flip-flops and bed head. You're not in Antioch. Again, it is what it is. Once you're at peace with this, I think it's hard not to have a good time.My version of an agua fresca whilst at SA is a hibiscus margarita. It's refreshing, not too sweet and very drinkable. Don't mix your boozes. You're at a Mexican(ish) restaurant. Tequila. Mezcal. Stay in these circles. Get a margarita on. Our server was quite polite, engaging and well-acquainted with the menu. I didn't have any of the issues discussed in other reviews. I didn't go at a bustling time (a Thursday evening) so maybe that had something to do with it? My party never had to wait for food, drinks, service, or the check. We even got in to a conversation with the bar staff. Everyone was very friendly. Maybe it's due to the fact that it wasn't very busy? I don't know. What I do know is that I had no complaints. I was with a New Yorker and she instantly picked up on what SA was putting down. I know a lot of people take umbrage with the wave of 'outsiders' bringing such a different flavor to Nashville's landscape without trying to first fit in to what's already here. I get it. I hear you. But, from my recollections of The Gulch (way before it was The Gulch), I think whatever you put here has to fit what it has become. I would never classify The Gulch as a very 'Nashville' neighborhood, therefore it doesn't bother me that it's populated by businesses that don't feel very 'Nashville.' Does that make sense?Population issues aside, as mentioned earlier, this is a nice spot to get some urbanized Tex-Mex. My chimichanga was the truth. It was a hoss of a cheese, chorizo and smoked chicken beast. It took a lot of effort to eat it (I wouldn't order it unless you're very hungry and have a big appetite) but eat it, I did... and I enjoyed every minute of it.

Although I know Rosepepper Cantina holds the honor of having 'The Best Margarita in Nashville,' after last night I will have to politely disagree. Saint Anejo's Cucumber Habanero Margarita is out of this world. I am not normally a fan of margaritas-- I find them to be too sugary and processed-- but last night changed my whole opinion. The habanero satisfying kick balanced with the refreshing breath of cucumber makes for one tasty, and dangerously easy to drink margarita. The company that I was with preferred a ginger rosemary option but both were delectable. My friend, the one who originally recommended this restaurant, said their sangria is the best in town. While I have not been able to drink sangria since over-doing it one spring break in Spain, my other friends agreed it was a top notch drink.Now for the food. Although I am not a vegetarian, I normally pick a vegetarian or fish option due to taste preferences, so when I saw a roasted mushroom taco, already salivating, I immediately gravitated toward it. My first instinct, although occasionally wrong, did not misguide me this time. The roasted mushroom tacos, tossed in a chipotle cordono sauce, accompanied by fresh pico de gallo, and wrapped in corn tortillas, were exquisite. It is not necessarily a combination I would have pegged for a taco, but they were so good that I took my leftovers this afternoon, sauteed some veggies, and had them again. Currently, in addition, I am writing this review and dreaming of the next time I can have those tacos. My friends ordered the short rib tacos and the tequila lime tacos and enjoyed them both immensely. All in all, I would say we had a very successful dining experience. I recommend next time you are looking for some gourmet but affordable Mexican, look no further than Saint Anejo, you will not regret it.", "location": "\nWashington, DC\n", "exp": " 27 reviews", "date": "2014-08-31"}, {"rating": "2.0", "name": "\nCarly B.\n", "review": "Wasn't such a fan.

My family is from Mexico and I've had fresh tortillas made from the corn on my grandparent's farm, cooked on their wood burning comal. I've had the \"street corn\" or elote from the street carts in Mexico City. With that being said, I didn't expect Saint Anejo to be quite that experience, but I expected it to be better than your typical Las Palmas food. I was really excited to see more authentic food on the menu like elote, dishes with mole, and goat cheese and drinks with mezcal. Although I don't drink mezcal, they get brownie points for having it.I ordered the Lolita to drink. It was a good fruity drink, enough said. I started off with the elote \u00a0(street corn). Typical elote is corn on the cob with lime, mayo, cotija cheese, and chili powder. This corn had a mayo/cilantro mixture on it and cheese and maybe some salt and pepper. I don't actually like a strong cilantro flavor, so it wasn't really for me but I'm sure others like it just fine. I was a little disappointed about how different it was from actual elote. I would understand the quite different adaptation if every Mexican place served elote, but they don't. I guess cilantro pleases the masses more than chili powder.Next, I had the carnitas enchiladas in the mole sauce with the rice and beans. The rice and beans were very good. I liked that the rice was not the typical red rice. The goat cheese sprinkled throughout was really good as well.The enchiladas themselves were not very impressive. I The mole sauce was very watery and lacked flavor. People don't often jump to eat something with mole, and I can understand if they don't if this was their first experience. The carnitas were barely distinguishable from the tortillas because they lacked flavor as well. If you want some good mole and you're not willing to make it or you're too uppety to go to South Nashville, go to Cantina Laredo. They have a mole that I might say is on par with my mom's. Lastly, I had the tres leches with mango cream. The cake was a bit denser than I'm used to, but it had the typical taste of tres leches. The mango cream was a very nice compliment. Overall, I understand what Saint Anejo is. They've put a twist on authentic Mexican food and packaged it all pretty to please the masses. I'm sure this floats someone's boat, but I can't find myself to appreciate it.I would probably go back with friends to have drinks and order something I don't have high expectations about like tacos or nachos.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 4 reviews", "date": "2015-01-24"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nArthi K.\n", "review": "Wonderful restaurant!

My main complaint is the value. My food was good - not outstanding, but good. I had the Duck Confit enchilada and my husband had tacos. Everything is a la carte and, while it was tasty, I did not think it was tasty enough to justify the price, especially since you have to order sides to make it a full meal. My husband ordered the Mezcal mule, and it was very good. The tequila has an excellent smoky flavor. I ordered a cucumber-habanero-lime margarita, a $13 drink that was teeny and not that great. I sent it back to ask for more pepper flavor since it was so cucumber-y. They added a muddled jalape\u00f1o, which made it better. They have a very good selection of yummy looking drinks and infused jalape\u00f1os. I think I may have just ordered one that wasn't for me. Overall, our service was quick and friendly and the atmosphere was trendy, which I like. \u00a0Our server knew everything about the menu and brought us out complimentary chips and salsa.

I'm personally a fan of the small string lights that crisscross the dining room; the lights and the high ceilings make you feel that you're outside in the open air, instead of in a building in one of the busiest parts of the city.Lofted above the restaurant is the tequila library, a fancy and plush bar that specializes in tequila. In the corner of the room is a skull-laden couch area for you to kick back and enjoy your drinks. We were brought up here first to do a tequila tasting. The two that we sampled were the Herradura silver and the El Mayor extra anjeo. The Herradura silver looked like clear grain alcohol and tasted to me exactly like what I remembered about straight tequila: a burning kick. While I wasn't a fan of this on it's own, paring it with a cinnamon dusted orange made it palatable, but still not something I would seek out. On the other hand, I learned that there are some types of tequila out there that I do enjoy! The El Mayor extra anejo was brown like a whiskey, smooth, and had notes of caramel and vanilla. I could some of these older tequilas in the future of this scotch-drinking girl.Our dinner started off with classic guacamole and a mango-papaya guacamole. The classic was kind of boring and was lacking something. Because it didn't have chunks of tomatoes or onions, and the avocado was really smooth, it reminded me of a paste. I prefer chunky guacamole which is why I really enjoyed the mango-papaya options. The chunks of fresh fruit added needed sweetness and a variety in the texture. Accompanying the guacamole were two queso options, chorizo and chile. The chorizo queso was solid, although I wished that the meat had a bit more spice and kick to it. I guess because I was craving something spicy I really liked the chile queso. The roasted peppers added a really interesting heat to the cheese, but after eating a bunch my mouth got too hot and I had to stop. Call me a glutton for punishment, but I like hot things.Speaking of hot things, next up was their version of jalapeno poppers. But this isn't the stuff that you get frozen/deep-fried at a bar. These were handmade applewood-smoked bacon wrapped jalape\u00f1os stuffed with jack cheese and served with a cilantro ranch. The batter was crisp and not too greasy, but this dish was so hot that no amount of ranch dressing could cool my mouth down. The bacon added a nice roundness to the heat, but all I could think about while eating this was Hot Chicken. I couldn't even finish one pepper. One whole glass of water and an avocado later, I was ready to move on with the meal.Quesadillas came next and I opted to try the shrimp and mango version with banana, chile, and cilantro crema. This might be my favorite dish of the evening. The shrimp was nicely cooked and still very soft. The mango (which I love) and banana (with which I have a complicated relationship) really worked well to add some tropical sweetness to this dish. What I would recommend is not using the sauce provided, or just using it sparingly. It really overpowered the delicate nature of the shrimp.Next I tried a bunch of tacos (short rib, grilled shrimp, cilantro lime steak, and tequila lime chicken). I enjoyed the short rib tacos the most. The meat was cooked till fork-tender and seasoned in a way that really stood out. The pickled peppers that are served with it added that vinegar kick that just makes me fall more in love with Mexican food each time. The shrimp tacos were very simple; solid but not remarkable. I think this is a dish they can get more creative with. The steak was very flavorful, spicy and left a really nice taste on the palate. The meat was good quality; tender and not chewy, because no one likes a chewy taco. The chicken was just \"meh.\" I personally don't enjoy chicken as much as other meats and I found this chicken to be kind of dry.For dessert we tried the tres leches and the flan. Tres leches is one of my favorite desserts and Saint Anejo did this justice. The cake was creamy, smooth, and soft without being plagued by the usual tres leches problem: So moist it's soggy to the point of imploding on itself. I love flan but I wasn't a fan of this version. It was really stiff and didn't jiggle or wiggle like flan is supposed to. It was really dense and the flavor wasn't anything special. I'd skip the flan and save the calories.Before coming to Saint Anejo, I had previously written off up-scale Mexican places. I had been to a few in Nashville, New York and elsewhere and I was never THAT impressed. I always came back to the small taco truck or the Mom and Pop place.

If you are looking for good service and good Mexican food, however, Saint Anejo is the last place in Nash I would go. \u00a0No, I take that back, I would just make tacos at home. First, the food. \u00a0The food is barely Mexican. \u00a0Just because you put something in a tortilla does not make it Mexican food. My friends got the hot chicken tacos and the reviews were sub par. \u00a0I got the chicken burrito, and I have to say I was really disappointed. \u00a0The flavors were not right for Mexican food. \u00a0The chicken had a weird sweetness to it that did not belong in the flavor profile for a basic chicken burrito. \u00a0It was just not right. \u00a0The best thing we tried that night were the shrimp tacos, but those were more asian tasting than Mexican. \u00a0I'm from San Diego, Ca. \u00a0I'm very picky about my Mexican food, and for the love of everything holy, all I want in this dang city is some real Mexican food, and Saint Anejo is not the place to find it. \u00a0Even the guacamole was just ok. I've had a major hankering for some legit Mexican food lately, and this morning I went to Baja Burrito on Thompson just to correct my disappointment with Saint Anejo's sad excuse for Mexican. \u00a0And I would say that if you are gonna go trendy instead of authentic, it had better be good, and the reviews from my friends with the trendy tacos were no better than mine. \u00a0I previously had some kind of Lamb mole dish? I think? when they first opened. \u00a0Again, the flavors were just wrong. It didn't work. I've had multiple experiences with poor service. \u00a0The staff is always very friendly, but I feel as though they are very inexperienced. \u00a0Last night, for example, guacamole got to our table before we had water, silverware, or chips to eat the guac with. Our server seemed harried, even though the restaurant only had a few tables. \u00a0Every time she came to the table she would do ONE thing, and then start to walk away. \u00a0For example, greet us and then walk away to get waters. She didn't inquire about drink or food orders, even though the regular menu was ending and going to the Late night menu. \u00a0Then it took her forever to come back. \u00a0We were ready to order when we sat down but getting her to stay long enough at our table to tell her that was nearly impossible. As a server myself, If I had had that table, it would have made more sense to greet the table with water, take a drink order on the first visit, inquire about any appetizer orders, and if they indicate they are ready to order, take the order then and there, especially if the regular menu is ending (bigger potential price tag!). \u00a0I totally understand that you can get behind while serving, but that's when you serve \"smart\" and try to consolidate trips to and from the table...Juuuust a suggestion that might make your life easier. In short, if you want a cool hang out, Saint Anejo is fine. \u00a0If you want great, legit mexican food....(or dare I say Cali-Mex????

This is my main issue with the restaurant, so I am hoping desperately that someone at M Street reads this and considers the suggestion. The margaritas ring in around $12, and they are delicious. BUT, you are paying $12 for a very small glass, filled with Sonic type ice. If I wasn't paying attention, I could easily take it down in one sip. Some combination of this needs to change - keep the Sonic ice & make the glass bigger, or change the ice & keep the glass size. I realize you can say it is the same tequila pour, but it is all about perception and people in Nashville just don't want to pay $12 for a miniature margarita.

I currently feel split on everything here, and I want to visit a couple more times before I feel confident in a review/rating. I did, however, try a good amount of dishes in my first visit, and there are some wonderful highlights.Fenwick's 300 is aptly named for Kevin Bacon's character in the 1982 film \"Diner,\" and for the old bowling alley that resided in this building. Tucked in between Sinema and Sulter, both new and popular restaurants this year in the Nashville area, Fenwick's is a modern diner done by the Bongo conglomerate of coffee shops. This is their first sit down and order venue. I believe it still has room to grow, and while I think it is a 3/5 place, I'm hopeful for it to be a 4/5 at least.My highlights: *Bottomless coffee, for three dollars? And it's Bongo coffee?!?!? Unreal to me. I went with my family this morning, the second day they were open, and my parents did this option for themselves. I think this is my favorite thing about the diner so far.*Lemon Beignet: They have other ones, including coffee, and cinnamon sugar, but this was the clear winner. Smooth and silky lemon flavor, the other beignets did not even come close to how awesome the lemon was.*Seasonal Coffee Drinks: I think Bongo has always been stellar in this section, and i like the intelligent, but simple choices in this department for Fenwick's. I ordered the \"A-Frame,\" with cedar simple syrup, orange, and clove. The orange zips out front, while the cedar and clove support the flavor. Great choice. Pairs well with...*Mascarpone French Toast: Wonderful presentation, and the cinnamon orange jam was, well, jammin'!\"Eh\":*The atmosphere is not bad at all, but it fits right in with Pinewood Social and Barista Parlor's new shop in the Gultch. Bright, fun, bowling alley styled. I'm used to this style already, but I appreciated the openness of the space.*For diner styled food, it tastes just like it, but is more expensive.

As stated by someone else, they are owned by the group that owns the Bongo Java coffee houses around town and they serve Bongo coffee. I don't drink coffee, so if you're reading my review for a coffee outlook, please skip to the next review.The meal that I had at Fenwick's 300 was breakfast on a Sunday morning, and I arrived at 8:00-8:15am. There was neither a line nor a wait at that hour on a Sunday - which is fine by me. The menu prices and offerings are on par with other area breakfast hotspots like Frothy Monkey, e.g., expect a breakfast for one to run you about $15 prior to tip (f you eat a full breakfast and not just some lame muffin or something).Service was prompt upon arrival to my table and friendly. I think my server had a trainee with her because there were two of them but one was never introduced nor spoke. Awkward for us all.I ordered the eggs benedict with a side of jalape\u00f1o cheddar grits.First, the grits: I couldn't taste any of the spice or heat from the jalape\u00f1os that were allegedly included within the grits. That's quite disappointing as I expected at least a little kick in the shorts with every bite, even if just a little kick. The cheddar was a bit much for the serving size (which was perfectly sized) but they put too much cheddar on/in them which made for this pile of melt on top that as it cooled congealed. Second, the eggs benedict. They were pretty good. Egg runny and perfectly cooked. Ham was nice as well, and the English muffin was baked correctly and I could both cut and chew through it (a problem I've encountered before at other places). Overall, I quite liked the Eggs Benedict.I give the place 3.5 stars for the following reasons:(1) 3 stars is \"A-OK\". 4-stars is \"Yay! I'm a fan.\" I'm somewhere in between the two.(2) Food: one thing was good (eggs benedict) and one thing was disappointing (grits)(3) Service: It was also in between A-OK and \"I'm a fan\". The fact that there were two of them and one was neither introduced nor spoke was just weird.I'm not discouraging that you give it a try, because maybe the coffee aspect will sway you to 4 or even 5 stars.

I chose to go with a beer and I was looking for either a porter or a stout as I wanted a heavier option.

After we received our drinks, we waited another 30 minutes before being asked what food we wanted. Fenwick's was not busy and had a number of open tables, so our server was not particularly busy (saw her milling about several times.) We had to ask another server to bring her over to our table to order, this the 30 minute wait as we wanted to see how it would play-out. We placed the orders and received our food in a timely manner. Our server was curt, not friendly and obviously didn't want to be there that night. There is a great bar in the middle of the restaurant and the lighting is interesting. As it is owned by Bongo Java it has an artsy/hipster vibe and much like Fido they offer smaller portions at higher prices. It's more focused as a breakfast/brunch destination than a dinner place.In conclusion, the food was great, the atmosphere is nice but it's too pricey to have to ask to be served.

But let me work through something before I get into the shinier happier parts of what I'm going to say:Let's talk about this \"diner\" concept. To me, that word conjures a general idea of comfort that permeates both menu items and atmosphere - a sort of intrinsically inelegant affair with lots of gravy. If you share that idea, Fenwick's 300 is probably not the over-sized slice of Americana you want but it might be the one you need. Walking in, the space is bright, open, and airy. There is plenty of seating, the booths are huge, and it seemed relatively quiet so bringing a small group here is a definite option. In our time there, we interacted with no less than three employees and all were pleasant and accommodating. Other than a few beers not being available, all systems were go. Having walked in with visions of chicken-fried something or other, nothing on the menu initially jumped out at me but I eventually settled on the biscuit sandwich. I was leaning toward getting the ham version but the server was kind enough to inform me that it was not country ham. I have no idea what other type of ham deserves a place on a biscuit nor did I care to find out, so I opted for sausage. I now think about this biscuit often in mid-morning daydreams. There was just the right amount of fig jam and goat cheese and the yolk of the fried egg was good and runny - perfect for dipping. There was a side of fruit and, I don't say this often, but it was a really good cup of fruit. My girlfriend got the meatloaf and, if we're being honest, that's always a risky move. Everybody's grandmother/mom/aunt made the best meatloaf in the world and nothing else ever compares but this one was pretty solid - definitely a little more complex than most I've had. To me, nothing sits alongside meatloaf better than mashed potatoes, so the mandatory roasted taters were a little bit of a let down but good in their own right. There was some half-off appetizer deal in effect while we were there so we ended the visit with a trio of beignets which somehow count as an appetizer. Personally, I thought the chocolate one was the standout but all were fresh, hot, and delicious. For two entrees, a dessert, plus a beer and a cappucino (forgot to mention this but the cappucino was legit - no surprise there with the Bongo Java affiliation) the whole thing came out to something like $37 before tip. Considering our usual dinner outing is usually closer to $50, I had no problem handing over the card on this one. A few of the entrees are a little steep but overall I don't see a lot of merit in the pricing complaints.Sadly, there weren't any ice-cream scoops full of mashed potatoes, nor were there any deep-fried proteins swimming in a pool of gravy but, if you're willing to broaden your scope of what a \"diner\" can be, there is definitely a lot to like about Fenwick's 300.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 2 reviews", "date": "2015-01-24"}, {"rating": "2.0", "name": "\nMaggie M.\n", "review": "Had heard so many good things about this place, so we went there for brunch on Sunday.

Thank you for being attentive!Now for the food: Our plates were beautifully presented and simply prepared. My partner's french toast was made from thick slices of bread that were carefully marinated in all things good. The slices fell apart which is exactly how french toast should be. My grits, eggs and bacon were excellent! The bacon was a super thick slice and the eggs were perfect (not hard to mess up) and the grits worked perfectly with everything else.

We got there around 11:15 and promptly were seated by a friendly worker. The atmosphere was very \"casual diner meets Nashville coffee house\" -- which was great. We were sat at a spacious booth, but there were also spacious tables, and a massive bar which would be perfect for coffee and a book in the morning.For lunch, I had the Fenwick's Breakfast. I like to think I've eaten myself through most of this town -- and I think this may be the best breakfast I've had in Nashville. The eggs were typical, delicious eggs, but there was something about the sausage and hash cakes that were completely divine. It was obvious that some time was taken in creating this dish,and that time resulted in a delicious breakfast. One of my friends had the Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup, and she hasn't stopped talking about the whipped goat cheese since.Overall, I can't say enough great things about Fenwick's!

It's not your traditional diner style, but that is fine with me, because I'm not one to go to places like Elliston soda shop or meat and threes. Of course Fenwick's has your classic diner foods like meatloaf, corned beef hash, biscuits (delicious) and gravy etc. But also throws in fried chicken with cornbread waffles and are one of the few restaurants that serve beignets and 5 different ways! They have recently changed up the menu a bit, adding more vegetarian options, which I greatly appreciated because I do not eat meat. Before, my choices were salads, grilled cheese, and sides. Now they have added breakfast chilaquiles con huevos, a house made veggie burger, \u00a0falafel plate (not all American), and bagels! I have yet to try the chilaquiles, but the veggie burger and falafel are delicious. They make everything in house and source local/organic when they can.

Visiting one at Vanderbilt, we made plans well ahead of time for breakfast with the family. Breakfast was ok. Grits were good. It was pricey. Staff were friendly. It was noisy. We all agreed that for half the money, we could have had essentially the same thing at Wholly Chow or even Athens, but since it was a Bob Bernstein (of Bongo Java and Fido fame) restaurant, we assumed the quality of goods would be better. Eh. And loads of sugar. Still, we were curious to try the lunch/dinner menu - though to be honest, after looking at it we were not nearly so curious. Diner food? Really? The word \"fussy\" has been used to describe the menu. I'd agree, along with \"Created-by-someone-very-young-who-never-visited-a-real-diner-before\". Or ate a Philly cheese steak, a decent patty melt, or homemade aioli.We entered at about 2 pm on a weekday, to be greeted by a pink-haired waitress who seemed surprised that we wanted to sit at a table rather than the counter. We assumed she'd seat us at one of the dozen or more empty tables, already set with dishes and silver, but it was not to be. She found the one table that needed busing, took her time clearing it, and finally returned to seat us. By then we were already irritated by the high volume of music, not to mention being seated at the back of the room when there were plenty of light tables available. But my wife doesn't like to \"make a scene\", so there we were.The waitress was lovely. No, they don't have any soda water. No, they don't have seltzer either. They do have water, which was served in a nice bottle.I questioned the roast beef sandwich, described only as \"roast beef, caramelized onions, gruyere, horseradish aioli, French roll, au jus.\" Yes, it was delicious. No, the roll wasn't really a baguette. Or French. Or crusty. Yes, I could have the aioli on the side. Being the diner-friendly person I am, I assumed this would either be shaved roast beef off a nice roast (the menu doesn't specify antibiotic-free or locally obtained, but I hoped), or a nice healthy piece of roast beef, the sort you'd get at J. Alexander's when you order a French Dip. In fact, the waitress even described it as a French Dip.My two friends ordered the patty melt, \"two gourmet pasture beef patties\" etc etc, with \"dijonnaise sourdough.\"How do I describe how indescribably bad this meal was? We all three agreed that our sandwiches were the worst we'd ever had. That's saying a lot, for three people who travel constantly and are often stuck eating hotel food or Denny's.My friends each had a few bites of their patty melts, then ate their salads instead. Which looked fresh enough, although it would have been nice if someone had made an attempt to dry the lettuce before plopping it onto the plates. The aioli was tasteless. How that's possible is beyond me. I asked for horseradish on the side. They had no horseradish. \"How is the horseradish aioli made, then?\" No answer. My friends asked for mayonnaise. They had no mayonnaise. \"How is the aioli made, then?\" No answer. The \"au jus\" was anything but; straight from a can, or possibly a carton, and doctored with an unidentifiable spice that made it hot to the tongue and unpleasant to the nose.The creamy parmesan salad dressing was all right, once I'd added salt and a lot of pepper. At least, it was better than the pseudo-aioli.The \"French bread\" was what you'd expect from a Southern supermarket - soft, white, and thanks to the chef, greasy. But the real astonishment was inside the sandwich. Shaved pieces of beef that looked - and tasted - like they'd been sitting in a fridge all day (I hope), burned around the edges, and again, completely tasteless. The \"Gruyere\" cheese was unlike any Gruyere I've ever known; no bite to it, no taste to it. The \"caramelized onions\" were cooked through, and browned, and damp. And tasteless.The sandwich looked like someone's idea of a Philly cheese steak, without the good beef, without the good cheese, without the fresh-cooked onions, and without the good bread. I tried it with the aioli; no improvement. I tried it with the parmesan dressing; slight improvement. I gave up after that. Between the strange condiments in the lukewarm \"au jus\", the greasy bread, the over-done meat and wretched onions, I couldn't finish any more.How to describe the meal? Here's how bad it was. We couldn't get the taste of the food out of our mouths. Rather than spend a ridiculous amount of money on coffee there, we drove down to the nearest gas station and purchased 3 small coffees, drowning our sorrows in them.Normally, I would give a new restaurant three tries, but after such an awful experience, I'm not willing to risk it.

I have to tell you, as a big time fan of steak and sweet potatoes, this place put my favorite steak restaurant (Del Frisco's Double Eagle) on notice. I was completely amazed at the flavors, perfect preparation, and overall taste of this meal.  \u00a0Dessert was Creme Brulee which, once again, surpassed our expectations by miles. Very delicious.  \u00a0Overall, one of the BEST meals we have eaten out and most definitely tied for top place on our list of higher-end steakhouses. Well done!

If you feel similarly, then get yourself to Stoney River. These may be fighting words, but here they are: Stoney River makes the best burger in Nashville.Although Stoney River is a steakhouse, my husband and I have only ever had the steak here once. It was REALLY good, but it's pricey. It's far more wallet friendly to come for the $12 burgers, which yes, may still seem a bit dear for a burger, but it's SO worth it. One bite and you'll be pulling the whole \"When Harry Met Sally\" orgasm scene, only without the faking! You can get a bacon cheese burger, or my personal favorite, the caramelized onion w/ swiss burger. So rich and decadent, I can only ever eat half. Best of all, this place knows how to cook their meat so if you ask for your burger medium rare, you can guarantee that that's what you'll get. Also awesome is that the burgers come with parmesan truffle fries that are amazing. Lots of places claim to have \"truffled\" things but with these fries you actually taste the truffle and it is spectacular. As an aside, if you aren't in the mood for a burger, the beef tenderloin sandwich is also fantastic. At $15.99, it might seem steep, but the meat inside is luscious and velvety. You could easily toss the bread and be happy with the meat alone. Tenderloin has the propensity to get dry if overcooked, but Stoney River's is buttery and soft. If you've been avoiding Stoney River because you think you have to get all dolled up or break the bank to eat here, worry no more. While one can certainly dine in style, I've also worn jeans and not felt out of place. You can also dine at the bar and on the patio if you feel like going more casual.

She asked for a medium ribeye cooked a little on the rare side, and that's what she got. (Lots of restaurants will overcook a medium steak, so we were both impressed that Stoney River got it right - as a steakhouse should.)Service was ridiculously nice. The restaurant actually comped an entire table of folks sitting next to us because they had an active duty member of the military among them who had recently returned from serving overseas. I mean it would have been nice enough if they comped the military member's dinner, but to comp the whole table's meal. That shows some serious respect for the troops and appreciation for their sacrifices!I have to admit that I wouldn't order my dish (the short ribs) again. The menu warned that it was well-marbled, but it was probably the fattiest short ribs I've ever had. The non-fatty part that I ate tasted good, but I'll definitely try something different next time. Fortunately, there are lots of other delicious-sounding choices on the menu from filets to burgers. Even some of the fish dishes sounded good.As for sides, I like the fact that the steaks come with sides. At most steakhouses, you have to order everything a la carte. Having some sides come with your dish definitely makes the meal a better value. My wife ordered the cinnamon sweet potatoes, which were incredibly smooth too sweet for us. I had the regular garlic mashed potatoes which \u00a0thought were excellent. And my short ribs also came with some asparagus which was both huge and perfectly cooked (well maybe a tad undercooked, but I'd rather have crunchy asparagus than mushy asparagus any day of the week).Stoney River also serves baskets of addictive little rolls along with some sort of luscious sweetened butter, so be careful not to fill up on that before your meal arrives.Oh and I also had a house salad with homemade dressing - I think honey mustard - that was delish too.So overall, I thought the experience was pretty fantastic. The restaurant has a very posh, elegant feeling inside and a nice layout with the place broken up into lots of smaller rooms to cut down on noise and provide more privacy. The layout would work especially well if you wanted to have a private party there.Although it's not cheap (it is a steak house after all!), it seems like you can get substantial discount coupons pretty easily by joining Stoney River's Red Canoe Society (a free-to-join loyalty club / emai list) through the restaurant's website. These coupons make the meal a great value, IMHO.I do have to say that I think the valet parking idea is silly here. I can see why it makes sense some places (i.e. Tin Angel) with limited on-site parking, but here you're literally giving your keys to a valet who parks the car 10 feet away in the restaurant's private lot. I guess they think valet parking makes the restaurant seem fancier? To me, it's just kind of annoying. I wish that it least customers had the option of self-parking, but I suspect they know that 90% of folks would choose that option and the valet parking attendants would have nothing to do.Anyway, I guess at least the valet parking gives people jobs and that's a good thing in this economy! :)", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 312 reviews", "date": "2010-07-09"}, {"rating": "1.0", "name": "\nLee M.\n", "review": "Fourth trip to Stoney River and it may be my last.My first trip was courtesy of my boss with the gift of meal voucher. \u00a0Hard to find any problem in that. \u00a0Food was great. \u00a0Service was a little spotty for such an expensive place so I guess they took my companion and I for cheapo coupon diners. \u00a0But the food was good enough that I wanted the entire family to experience.Second time out, our orders were wrong. \u00a0One diner asked for \"medium well\" and go bloody rare. \u00a0Another asked for \"medium\" and got well done and the wrong side dishes. \u00a0But once they got the order correct, the food was good. \u00a0The manager brought out the replacement dishes and apologized but no offer was made to compensate us. \u00a0A free desert for the offending rare steak would have been nice.It is a little irritating that the staff pretends to care what you name is and uses it often during the evening. \u00a0If the server had really been paying attention, she would have realized that she had just served our same party two days before. \u00a0And I'm pretty sure we would have stood out in her mind with the free ($200 plus) meal we had.Third trip out was WONDERFUL. \u00a0The wait staff was spot on. \u00a0Never fussing around the table but always showing up just a moment before we realized we needed something. \u00a0As usual, I ordered the coffee cured fillet and it was good.

Nice lighting. Spacious booths. Not very noisy at all, given the number of people in the dining area. Our waiter was \"efficient.\" Service was prompt and we were never left waiting. However, at least twice, when I tried to say something to the waiter, he was gone before I could get out more than a couple of words. Efficient is good, but when taking away a plate or refilling a beverage, the wait staff should be attentive to their current table just in case there might be a comment or question. We started with the Spinach Artichoke Dip. It was nice and warm, and came with a really nice Salsa and chips. However, after the first bite, we both came to the same conclusion -- warm blandness. The dip really needed some garlic, or something to pick up the flavor. The saving grace was that the Salsa is really good. For other starters, my brother ordered the Lobster Bisque Soup, and I ordered the Blue Cheese Lettuce Wedge. The soup was quite good. The lettuce wedge was just OK. It was an Iceberg lettuce wedge with an average Blue Cheese Dressing drizzled over it, with bacon and diced tomatoes. There was nothing really that wrong with this salad. I mean, hey, Bacon, and lots of it! However, it pales compared to other executions. A fantastic example is right across the street at BrickTops, where the Blue Cheese Lettuce Wedge is almost a religious experience. The Steaks My brother ordered a 12 oz Prime Rib, medium rare. My brother felt that his prime rib was closer to rare. However, it was a beautiful end to end even pinkish red that I would call medium rare. Nonetheless, he felt that the Au Jus tasted like it had come from a can, and that while good, the prime rib was missing a hearty roasted or smokey flavor he has experienced in other restaurants. Again, not really bad, but more of a bland, unexciting experience than one would expect at this price point. On the good side, he thoroughly enjoyed his fully loaded baked potato. Bacon saves the Day! I ordered the 14oz Ribeye, also medium rare. When they brought me the steak, the server asked me to cut into it, to make sure it was prepared properly. It looked reasonably medium rare. However, as I traveled further up the steak, it became apparent that there was much more rare purple than red medium rare. Now, I am actually quite happy with a good rare steak, so I really did not find this a real problem. However, I was very disappointed in the quality of the meat. It was tougher than I expected, and the sinews were very chewy, getting stuck in my teeth. Finally, they use a seasoning rub that includes rosemary. It is not overwhelming, but it is there. If you are not partial to rosemary, you may want to ask them to leave off the seasoning rub. When the manager came by, we gave him a polite, but honest appraisal. He apologized for our disappointment and discounted our meal, even though we told him that a discount was unnecessary. I give the manager credit. He accepted our critique with concern and grace. I have been other places where managers either didn't care, became defensive, or even got rude.

Although the atmosphere is actually great on some Friday/Saturday nights when they have live music. My main dislike here is actually the lamb/beef gyros. Most of the gyros I've had before feature thin slices of meat. The gyros here feature thick chunks of meat, which actually have kind of a mushy texture. The texture of the meat is really unpleasant to me. If you like gyros that are thin slices of flavorful meat, skip the ones here. If you want that kind of gyro, you're better off with Anatolia (Turkish, so a little different seasonings, but at least good meat).Other dishes are much better than the gyros - the falafel is reasonably good and some of the other ground lamb dishes are seasoned really nicely. Their hummus is pretty decent, but served with really uninspiring pita bread that taste like the Wonder Bread of the pita world. \u00a0I wouldn't call any of the main dishes here particularly authentic - just \"not bad for Nashville\".The baklava is actually the only thing served here that seems authentically Greek.

The only asset Kalamata's offers to its patrons is a non-threatening strip mall environment for suburbanites wishing to declare \"cultural awareness\", by way of eating stale \"middle eastern food\" at a remarkably inflated price (gotta pay for that non-threatening atmosphere somehow). They will however attempt to provide you with a classic experience, by having a self-satisfied man hand mix you fresh salads in a dirty salad bowl, to resounding adequacy, as a front and center attraction. Give him three balls and he'll probably juggle too.OOOOOO Salad!The meal:Babaganouj: Small portion, certainly nothing worth being classified as an appetizer to share with another person, at most possibly a side dish, which should cost half of what was being charged, with one piece of covetous store bought stale pita bread. The babaganouj was a gray lifeless puree that looked, and tasted like it was made over a week ago. The overall bouquet embodied that of a typical ploy to substitute the flavor of eggplant by overwhelming it with garlic. I doubt they even make it from scratch, despite the ease of such a recipe. They did garnish it with one olive and a little oil while failing to provide cumin garnish to complete the dish. Shameful.Spinach Pie: It's a pita with spinach in it cooked, and they sprinkle a little bit of Feta over it and charge $4. Never mind, the true dish that requires light crispy, filo dough with spinach, and egg, prepared to perfection. The overall flavor was bitter, watery, and lifeless.Not Recommended.Gyros Sandwich: First of, Don't get the $9 dollar gyro plate it is a rip off, at best, if you have to, get the Gyro sandwich, throw it in the trash, and then go somewhere good to eat. The gyro meat is diced in an unconventional manner; probably to provide an eclectic spin on a basic over saturated dish. In reality dicing gyro meat was an attempt to put less of the most expensive ingredient into the overall sandwich, a brazen move but certainly one that cannot warrant its small portion size or price. I guess they have to look busy somehow. I asked for a Gyro with no Tomato only to receive a Gyro laden with Cucumber. NOT AN OPTION ON THE MENU, even more filler, and uncalled for. Restaurateur 101: Provide only what you advertise on your menu please! Some people are disgusted by the overwhelming flavor of Cucumbers. Plus, who is happy about a flat gyro. That's right completely flat.Not recommended.The salad tosser -\"chef\" did not like my basic issues with the food, and asked me to leave. I asked for what I ordered, remained and finished. After the experience my stomach was as if I just drank 2 cups of salad dressing, and fell sick.Bussing your own dishes is the name of the game, and try not to be disgusted by the three tiny trash cans that are overflowing with garbage right near the front door.Health Inspection Anyone?YUCK!

I had the cornmeal encrusted trout and they allowed me to substitute the panzanella due to my dietary restrictions. I my first two experiences were good, but this experience was phenomenal.

Then he didn't return to take our drink order for awhile. Our two appetizers took close to 30 min. (They were meat and cheese plates). The waiter kept saying \"sorry, there is a large group inside\". Well, no offense, but you telling me that another group of people is more important than me isn't customer service. After another 20 min, our two small dishes came to the table. The fettuccini had no flavor and was about 6 bites worth and the meatballs were small, tasty, but nothing to write home about. The bread that we had been promised since after the appetizers came out after we were done with everything and was just two small pieces of bread. Not once during our meal did a manager come and speak to us to apologize nor was one item on our bill removed for the inconvenience. It was excuse after excuse instead of a simple conversation and compensation for their in house problems. I have been in the restaurant industry for over ten years, have a masters in Hospitality and Tourism Management & I'm the Executive Director of a charity in the industry. I am not impressed to pay over $100 for a few small plates and two cocktails that were so un-filling that my boyfriend came home and made himself another meal. I realize this wasn't the waitstaff's fault, management should have spoken to us and we should have been treated as valuable as the \"big party\" inside. The atmosphere was nice and I loved the music but, needless to say, we won't be returning.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 3 reviews", "date": "2015-05-08"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nSuz J.\n", "review": "Waltzed down The Boulevard after a stroll in blooming Warner Park, to new Noelle Restauant.

That was my mistake. With as much time as I spent going up and down Elliston, I'm surprised that I never wandered in here. It was probably the fear of what the dive bar \u00a0held that kept me out. In hindsight, I probably wasn't mature enough for the experience. But now that I'm older and wiser, I'm all about bellying up to a bar, getting some good food in my belly, enjoying a cold beer, and engaging in some worthwhile chat with colorful regulars.The bar itself is pretty cool. It's been around for 40 years and there's no sign of it going anywhere (thank goodness). The wood, smoke smell and vibe (pool tables!) are authentic and you need to understand, prepare and appreciate them to truly understand the Gold Rush experience. As much as I advocate sitting at the bar, there are plenty of two tops and tables to host your party. But remember, smoke.Eating at a dive bar? Yeah, normally I'm all never-ever-ever-never-ever-never-infinity on that call but here... I'll do it. What? Me? Yeah, me. That should go to show you just how damn good the bean roll is. Don't call it a burrito, this sucker is as big as a football, drenched in cheese, red sauce, lettuce, onions, and cheese. I got mine with spicy chicken and I was pleased to see a metric ton (well, maybe not that much) of shredded, spicy poultry all up in, on top and around the dish. It's as substantial as you would imagine. Come here hungry and determined. It took all my will power and fattyfatfatness to overpower the beast. I'd do it again. I was helped in my quest by a couple of pints of Gerst. For a dive bar where you might assume the only thing on draft is fear and you can have a bottle of shutthefupanddrinkwhatIgiveyou, The Gold Rush has a relatively sophisticated beer menu. This isn't just a place for drunks looking to make it through another night. You can find a beer (draft or bottle) that'll cure what ales ya. If beer isn't your thing, drink a spirit (neat or on the rocks) and keep it moving.The colorful regulars were... colorful. But, that should be expected at a place like The Gold Rush. My bartender knew her brew and had plenty to say on the local craft beer movement and which breweries were legit (and which ones... aren't). I eavesdropped on some biker guys having a conversation about smoking pot, cheating and guns. I got a bit scared so I tuned out of that one. And then I had a fellow strike up a conversation with me about all sorts of troubling (and terrifying) conspiracy theories. C'mon, man. I just want a bean roll!

And, I should dig it, given the '70s throwbacks throughout the air and on the walls. $3 well drinks made things go down pretty easily, as well. Being that I was hungry as well as thirsty, I studied the menu for some choice eats. I almost went to town on the black bean chicken chili nachos (right? how good does that sound?) but our waitress talked me in to the comparatively healthy chickpea/beet veggie burger... which I, then, proceeded to make unhealthy by 'Elising' it with bbq sauce, onion ring, pickles, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and avocado topping. Of course, it was magically delicious. How could anything *not* be with all those amazing toppings. The veggie burger itself was a bit crumbly but that's par for the course with homemade veggie burgers.Food coma starting, I got my second of the 2 for 1 beer and walked around a bit.

In general, the staff were very disconnected and borderline rude, harboring a \"too cool to be bothered\" attitude that doesn't jive with their choice to work in the service industry. The food... Solid but unspectacular. I had the chicken and waffles, and was served a couple chunks of dry white meat heavily battered and fried past done. The waffle was average, helped by tech yolk spilling from the optional egg atop it. My girlfriend's BLT was solid, propped up by a couple slices of their excellent local bacon. Another in our party raved about the fried french toast. Their Bloody Mary mix is house made, and excellent. The decor and concept has promise... But IMO it misses the mark.

My roommate & I arrived around 7PM on a Friday night for dinner, and a friend of hers joined us shortly thereafter. The place was fairly empty, maybe only about half full, which was somewhat surprising. Positives: - Our waitress (I believe her name was Mariah?) was one of the best waitresses I've had at any establishment in a long time. She was incredibly helpful with her recommendations of beers on tap and was just an awesome, friendly person. Far from the poor reviews other patrons have given the waitstaff. - My dinner: I ordered the chicken tenders, which were amazingly good. They were tender, juicy and perfectly fried. I ordered honey mustard to go with them (which they apparently make in-house) and it was a great combo for both the tenders and fries. I'm STILL thinking about those tenders!Negative:- We ordered the sundried tomato & basil flatbread as an appetizer and I wasn't particularly bowled over by it. The cheese seemed to have a bit of a rubber consistency and I couldn't really taste much of the sundried tomato element of it. It definitely came up short. By 9PM, the place had filled up and was packed for the live music that was about to begin. We stayed for about an hour into the set and the crowd seemed to be into it, but it wasn't music I have much knowledge of, so I'll abstain from giving my opinion on that. All in all, it was a much better experience than I thought I might have, given the other reviews.

After the article in a recent Scene about the brunch- complete with a picture of a waffle that will make you salivate after one glance- I knew it was somewhere I needed to be. My husband and I were actually off together the ENTIRE weekend this past weekend (I honestly thought CNN needed to be notified). I was so excited. We were going to get to go to brunch like all of the other cool couples! After visiting a church on West End, we made our way here. It is not hard to find at all. Just look for the house that has all of the cars around it at the corner of 51st and Indiana. This place is so cute. I loved all of the wall art. I think my favorite was the 3D map of the US. This past Sunday was their first day open after being closed for some renovations, so they were crowded. It wasn't one of those uncomfortable situations, though. You could sit anywhere you wanted, and we managed to find a table for two by the stage. We didn't wait very long for someone to stop by our table with menus even though watching for a couple of minutes, it looked like they could have used another server. The two ladies I saw were just all over the place. I stared at the menu for 10 minutes trying to decide between the French Toast Casserole and the Weekend Waffle, which had been Peppermint Bark. I finally decided I was too curious about a peppermint waffle to pass that up, so I ordered the weekend waffle. My husband decided on the breakfast sampler after he saw that he could get Andouille sausage with it. When our food came, I immediately wished we had ordered a side of biscuits. They make their biscuits from scratch; they taste almost as good as the ones my grandmother makes. I love biscuits. I am convinced I could live off of them, but I keep getting told that you need the other food groups to survive. Whatever. His eggs and sausage were really good, too. \"But Rachel, how was your waffle?\" Well, I'll tell you. The waffle itself was delicious, as was the mint chocolate syrup they put on it. It was SO GOOD. The part I could have done without was the crushed peppermint on top. I don't like hard peppermint candy. I was picturing the Godiva peppermint bark squares you get at Christmas; those melted on top of the waffle would have been great. I'm totally not hating on my waffle, though.

The birthday boy summed it up - the place needs less hipness and more service.It started out well enough. A couple of people had ordered drinks when we arrived, and encouraged us to try the Babs on a Budget. The waiter came back after a few minutes for our order, and my husband tried it. Boring Me had some ginger ale. Drinks took a few more minutes to get there, but came in cute mason jars, and everyone was happy.20 minutes later, the waiter finally returned. He seemed annoyed that we ALL needed more drinks by that time. He brought them back, and seemed to need reminded that we might want to order food. We were getting hungry by that point, so we indicated that we would get an appetizer, but we would order at the same time. As soon as we mentioned the appetizer, he ran off to put in the order without getting our food orders.A little while later, the pimento cheese appetizer arrived, delivered by the bartender. Pretty good. A little pricey for something served on saltines, but I guess that's part of the hipness of the dish.The cheese itself was tasty.We were pretty hungry by the time the waiter returned to get our order. And then we waited and waited for the food. We all kept trying those little tricks you use in a restaurant. \"I know when I come back from the bathroom, they'll be bringing the food out.\" We had been there more than an hour and a half by the time dinner finally came to our table. There were some apologies muttered in the meantime, but they didn't seem that sincere. Especially since our drink glasses kept getting empty. And everything was a mess. He didn't seem to know who had ordered what, or what sides came with each person's main dish. The girl to my left got the kale salad instead of the house salad. There was an unclaimed dish of macaroni. The birthday boy's burger arrived, with a promise that the fries would be out soon. And everything was cold as though it had been sitting, waiting to be delivered.My husband's gumbo was okay. Really more like chili, and a little cold, but there would have been few complaints had it arrived in a timely fashion.I have to say that my marrakesh kale salad was the highlight of the evening. Good flavor, good texture. Quite nice.But my burger, my poor burger. I think Elsie would have been disappointed with her \"favorite.\" It was cold and positively squishy where the juices had soaked into the bun. I ordered the BBQ sauce on the side, and it came on the side - and on the burger. I had ordered the burger medium - I know that's always a risk - but as I finished the last couple of bites, I realized that part of the squishiness was meat that hadn't gotten cooked at all.

It's one of those things you hope never changes, but you can't help but fear that something--some outside force or something internal--will cause it to lose that spark. This place has amazing shows, fantastic food and drinks, incredible decor (lots of maps; you won't be able to miss it, but make sure to take a look at the huge mural map of the United States on the back wall) and accommodating staff. It wonderfully meshes a classy restaurant with a grungy bar-house. It's a place you can take your grandparents to (Monday nights: Bingo!) and also your party-prone friends. William Tyler, an amazing local musician, owns the place along with his sister. This must be how they book so many incredible musicians. I can't stress enough how much I enjoy their lineups.

This definitely has the risk of becoming that hot 'new place' that people feel compelled to check out (as I did yesterday and the day before). And rightfully so. The minute you step foot onto the cozy front porch lit up with a garland of warm lights, you'll feel like you accidentally crossed the border into some hip, new place in East Nashville. (But then the flickering lights from a couple of cop cars perusing the neighborhood will remind you that you're really just north of Charlotte.)PROS: The menu is what I'd probably describe as eclectic pub grub, so points for originality. The burger is delish. I believe the chubby grass-fed beef patty is hand-patted with love and it comes on a nice soft, sugary bun with a slice of Kenny's Farmhouse cheese and the standard assortment of burger enhancements. And you can get that with a side of kale and qinoa which also deserves a shout-out. And don't forget to kick off the night with some hot chicken bites. The kimchee reuben is supposedly the most popular item on the menu--a novel idea and a pretty good, respectable attempt in gangnam-erican cuisine, but could use a tad more gangnam. Lastly, can't talk about this bar/restaurant joint mentioning something about the bar part: The beer selection is perfectly sized and varied AND beer on tap is served in mason jars (*extra points!*). Cons: The Laughing Man and BBQ nachos could use a little more work in the flavor department...but what this place may lack in food, it makes up big time in atmosphere. This is the place to go if you're looking to hang out somewhere that is way cooler than your house, but just as comfortable, if not more so.

The soup was tasty as a nice counterpoint. The atmosphere was comfortable. The lighting was low but still allowed one to see the menu and fellow table mates. I give a nod to the old chrome sets that dot the place along with the booths. However, I am a bit lost about the 'dance area' and the turntables up on the stage. The place did not strike me as a great venue for such activities and the amount of floor space that could be used to serve more customers seems like a lost opportunity. The Stone Fox's space more feels like newer Family Wash with trendier veneer, less menu options, and wee bit more of a nod to the nonplussed hipsters chic than the funky grunge throwback of Wash. All in all, I am rooting for the place but I think it is at best a good spot for a drink and a conversation and not much else.

I'm writing this review after my 3rd visit to the Stone Fox, so I will try to provide input from all 3. First encounter: We just went for beers and to listen to live music. Con - We ultimately had to sit outside because the volume was unbearable, and I'm no stranger to small music venues with Indy artists. Pro - They have a neat patio area. Second encounter: This was for a neighborhood function. I had an ok burger and again listened to live music with less than great acoustics and obnoxiously loud volume. It was difficult to converse with people at my table, and we were even sitting on the other side of the restaurant. Third encounter: A friend and I went for dinner on a Wednesday night; I had Elise's Favorite (it was just fine) and my friend had the BBQ plate (we both worked at BBQ places during high school or college and were less than impressed). By the time we received our food after sitting down at the bar to order, 45-50 minutes had passed with no explanation from anyone. This is unacceptable! Ordinarily I would pass the time with a bourbon or beer, but they charge $10-12 for a pour of Woodford Reserve. Some places might be able to get away with that, but this is not one of them.

Those who went the pulled-pork route noted that it was pretty dry, and the fried shrimp folks weren't too pleased either. I myself had big issues with South Street's re-interpretation of the tater tot. Clearly, they were made this way purely for the sake of trying to be clever. However, the downside of making these giant lumps is that you lose that burst of crunch you get every bite with smaller pieces (and correspondingly more surface area).It's worth noting that the online menu seems to pretty out-of-date as of December 2014.

Now, I wasn't going to add to this scene by getting into a verbal banter with the man, but if you're a manger you a) shouldn't use that language with any customer and b) should not remark snidely to others who have to witness this and c) should come back and offer an apology to me for my four year old having to witness that.  \u00a0I've always been happy with the atmosphere, menu and service here up until this incident.

I have been going to South Street for about 19 years. Back in the day, while visiting Nashville, I'd go there with my brother-in-law for lunch because it was a half block away from his office at Almo-Irving (Now Universal Music Publishing Group). Great BBQ, crab, po'boys, craw fish, excellent slaw, and cold beer. I loved the open air dining and friendly vibe.Fast forward a couple decades, and I now own a condo across the street, so when I visit my Belmont Student daughters from California, I spend a lot of time at South Street. The food is still good. It is nice to watch whatever sporting activity might be playing on one of the many TVs. The beer is still good and cold, and the management and staff are friendly. South Street is a great place to hang out.Upstairs is the tree house, where a lot of the regulars are drinking and smoking. I can only handle it up there when the windows are open because of the bad air. So, on cold nights I will stay downstairs, whether I'm there for lunch, dinner, dessert, or just to get a cold beer or wine. Sometimes my wife and I will \"progressive party\" it in the neighborhood by starting with a pizza and beer or wine at The Bound'ry, then moving next door to Giovanni Ristoranti, for a glass of wine and another hors d'oeuvre, then over to South Street for dessert and a night cap before heading back to the condo across the street.Great place, great location, great people, and decent prices.

So that was a little disappointing. \u00a0I received warm mussels less than 5 min later, so they probably didn't make me new mussels but rather just warmed mine up. \u00a0Most people seemed content with their second courses. \u00a0When the second round of drinks came out that was a bit of a disaster. \u00a0They messed up a lot of the martini orders. \u00a0I get that 9 martini orders can be a little difficult - but most of us asked for no vermouth which is a pretty simple alteration..Another thing that was very off putting was the that the waitress and another lady taking care of us (probably the assistant manager) clearly did not like each other and they bad mouthed each other at our table. \u00a0Whenever there was a mistake they blamed the other. \u00a0They clearly did not communicate with each other because some things came out in double. \u00a0I had never really experienced a dining experience with fighting staff before and it was uncomfortable - I did not go out to dinner to relive high school drama. \u00a0So, all in all I was a bit surprised when I saw the final bill that my two martinis were outrageously expensive for Nashville - if I was in a bigger city, fine...if I had ordered grey goose martinis, maybe. \u00a0But as I said $14 for a ketel one martini is more than I have ever paid. \u00a0Then, my mussels were not comped and they should have been. \u00a0A starter salad, bad mussels and 2 martinis should not cost me $50.. \u00a0 \u00a0This was my first time in Nashville and at least for visitors, I wouldn't recommend this place because it is off the beaten path of other areas and there were plenty of other options out there.", "location": "\nAtlanta, GA\n", "exp": " 60 reviews", "date": "2014-11-06"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nTim S.\n", "review": "Nice homey decor, prompt seating, service got a bit overwhelmed by the lunch rush after that. \u00a0We ordered a variety of dishes, all of which seemed pretty decent but all seemed to be influenced by committee rather than a decisive chef. \u00a0My carrot orange ginger soup had a fantastic mix of flavors and a great gingery bite but seemed too lightly based and insubstantial. \u00a0The Rueben (\"best in Nashville!\") had excellent corned beef but was light on sauerkraut presence and I'd be happier if the bread could decide what the hell it was (answer: rye only please).

The shrimp bisque was good but TINY, and the best dish was definitely the mushroom ravioli. It was out of this world. For entrees, the shining star was the duck, but I heard good things about the steak options and the shrimp and grits. I didn't love my lamb, but I think that is more because I don't like the shank part of the lamb. Will order differently next time.

However, it was far too loud and was a terrible place for a business lunch.I can't speak to the other's food, but mine was very disappointing. It began with a bowl of rolls delivered to the table. They were hot, but not particularly tasty and the butter served with them had a freezer-burned taste. I had the wild mushroom ravioli. It was absolutely bizarre. I love mushrooms, but this was covered in so many sauces (yes, two), that I couldn't taste the filling. Maybe I've watched too many episodes of Kitchen Nightmare, but the pasta didn't taste fresh or homemade. I think that Butoni wild mushroom agnoletti in the grocery store would have been better. Disappointing, too, because Lazarolli's is right across the street and I'm sure they would have provided wonderful ravioli. \u00a0Worst were the sauces. It was floating in a really thin tomato sauce that then had dollops of pesto on top. Both were salty, but then there were the most bizarre spices coming through (for example, dill and cilantro!). A light cream sauce would have been lovely and would have complemented the mushrooms beautifully! It was really, frankly, awful.But to make it weirder, it was served with mushy brussel sprouts that had been cooked with peppers and onions on the side. Maybe that's where that dill came from in the pesto sauce?They had a large sign up that boasted locally-sourced product, such as Noble Springs, but I didn't see any sign that there was goat cheese on the menu!

I'm glad I went.If you're going at regular dinner hours, definitely make reservations. I did it online (there's just something stress-free about not having to talk on the phone), and on Friday morning the only reservations left were either 6 or earlier, or 8:30 or later. When we got there, I realized it was probably because the place is so small. It's in an old house, and it actually reminds me of a library. Lots of old wood, bookshelves and a couple paintings featuring our own Yazoo.The bad thing about visiting their website beforehand was making the mistake of looking at the menu and getting excited about items that they weren't serving that night. I understand that they are all about local and fresh, but every appetizer and entree we had picked out wasn't on the evening's menu. Alas.Instead, we ordered some sort of crab cake appetizer with a fried green tomato relish that was rich and delicious. The number-one way to please my carb-loving boyfriend is to serve bread, and they came through on that one, so we were being real classy, putting the tomato relish on the bread. Maybe not how it was meant to be served, but it worked.He ordered the Maple Leaf Farms duck - I only mention the farm name because we just featured them in one of the magazines I edit, and it's unusual to recognize a non-Tennessee brand (they're in Indiana) in a local restaurant. I'm not a fan of duck - I tried it, but just don't like the texture - but the boy loved it. It came with what they called chorizo but wasn't ground like Mexican sausage is usually served - it was cured, like bacon, so obviously that was delicious.I ordered the pork tenderloin - not my usual choice, but I am newly returned to the hardcore carnivore side of the menu, particularly at sustainable-focused restaurants like the Mad Platter, and I really do love the sweet meat genre of entrees. The pork came with sweet potatoes and some sort of greens mixed with tomatoes... all bursting with flavor. Unfortunately, I had filled up on bread and crab cakes, but my leftovers tasted just as amazing heated up in some Corningware in the oven.So, I'd say this place is perfect for date night... not a place I'll be visiting often, but perfect for special occasions.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 22 reviews", "date": "2011-09-24"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nNaomasa H.\n", "review": "Came here for a private event in the summer.

\u00a0Well, if you scooped up everything on the plate in one fork-full - the crust, the lamb, the rissoto, etc. - \u00a0that was the way to really get the full experience. \u00a0The salmon was another very well cooked piece of fish I've in Nashville (everybody tells me not to eat fish in a landlocked state, but I have experienced some wonderfully prepared fish here), and was served on top of stewed spinach, honeydew and cucumber. \u00a0I don't like honeydew, but when served in a hot compote-like thing it was really nice. \u00a0The salmon was glazed with rum and mango. \u00a0And finally for dessert, we had creme brulee and bananas foster. \u00a0The bananas foster was exceptional. \u00a0How could it not be, really? \u00a0Butter, brown sugar, bananas, and ice cream. \u00a0Sounds like a winner. \u00a0The creme brulee was surprisingly thick, and enhanced with lemon zest. \u00a0The crust was maybe a little under crispy, possibly due to the inclusion of lemon in the dish??In any case, I would absolutely go back to the Mad Platter for another meal, but it would have to be a special occasion meal. \u00a0Its name implies to me that the food should be more adventurous, abnormal. \u00a0It's not quite strange enough for me. \u00a0Yes it's pricey and your dollar could go a little further elsewhere. \u00a0Still, I enjoyed being and eating there so much that there is no doubt I will return.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 295 reviews", "date": "2009-06-08"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nApril M.\n", "review": "It was a hot and sticky night when a friend and I decided to have small plates at Mad Platter Restaurant in Historic Germantown Nashville. \u00a0The staff was so pleasant and helpful and seemed like they were really glad we were there. \u00a0Well, let me tell you, not so glad as we were! \u00a0I so wish I'd taken pictures of our plates. \u00a0Like I said it was hot outside and had been...really unpleasant for several days, so we opted for cool appetizers....each a crab cake served with cucumber chow chow and lime jalape\u00f1o remoulade, and we shared an order of BLT Bruscetta ....Oh, my gosh! \u00a0How much better could it have been?!Not a bit until Cory tempted us with peach shortbread. \u00a0About as good as anything I've ever eaten. \u00a0We should have had one each.....and the peaches aren't even really in yet. \u00a0I heartily recommend The Mad Platter ..and don't forget, they serve brunch. \u00a0It's great to live in a city of \u00a0so many really good restaurants with chefs who know fresh food and how to prepare it, \u00a0better yet that this one is right around the corner!", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 3 reviews", "date": "2013-06-13"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nJamie A.\n", "review": "I'm a big fan of Mad Platter. \u00a0When I worked in MetroCenter, this was a once-a-week stop for a fantastic lunch. \u00a0The lunch menu changes seasonally, but one of the all time best dishes I enjoyed was a pecan crusted chicken with a creamy strawberry sauce. \u00a0I'm also a big fan of the creamy dill dressing.I've only had one dinner experience, but it was fantastic. \u00a0We ended up doing the multi-course deal for one and an entree for the other. \u00a0No way we could finish two appetizers/salads/desserts in addition to our mains. \u00a0The chili-mac (beef tips and gnocchi) appetizer was absolutely decadent. \u00a0We also had a wild mushroom bisque that was subtle and not too mushroomy (I know, a mushroom hater shouldn't order mushroom bisque...). \u00a0I had a steak and my boyfriend had the lamb. \u00a0Both were cooked beautifully! \u00a0We finished off dinner with creme brule and coffee. \u00a0An fitting finish to a great date night.", "location": "\nBelmont/Hillsboro, Nashville, TN\n", "exp": " 191 reviews", "date": "2011-04-17"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nDavid G.\n", "review": "Mad Platter, you drive me to the brink of insanity like the Mad Hatter... or, even better, like Charlie Sheen. \u00a0Seriously, there is somewhere trapped inside you a deeply lovable man who obviously cares about his children but on the outside there is a complete lunatic who is \"bi-winning\".Our server for the evening was impeccable, and was able to describe the dishes for the evening in a meaningful way and was knowledgeable of the wine - to the point that he described our Malbec as \"one of his favorites\" as he \"just loved how it had an almost leather smell and deep robust flavor like a good dark chocolate\". \u00a0Either the man knows his job or he's an alcoholic. \u00a0The food was just OK. \u00a0I ordered the lamb which he said they were known for. \u00a0It was cooked correctly (unlike #1 wife's filet mignon) and was very succulent but it did not knock me out of my chair and was not better than any other lamb I had ever had. \u00a0The cous cous that came with it was just alright, and I did not really enjoy the raisins within it. \u00a0I did love the banana curry sauce on the side, however.The decor was quaint and small - I can see why they fill up quickly.All and all, I'd go back if people invited me or I had worn out my taste buds at some of the places I frequent more often. \u00a0But, I wouldn't make a special trip out here.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 348 reviews", "date": "2011-03-13"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nMallory S.\n", "review": "Had been wanting to try the Mad Platter for years and finally did last night for a friend's birthday dinner.

A great balance of both flavors, beautiful presentation, with a swirl of red curry oil and a dollop of creme fraiche. The app was a cheese plate, nice small portions (after all, still 3 courses to go), and a thoughtful balance of sauces or purees to accompany the cheese. For instance, a small chunk of Brie could have the pear pur\u00e9e, or the bits of cranberry. The bleu had slices of olive and a red pepper coulis beside it. The roasted beet salad came next, dressed w frissee salad, pine nuts and a citrus vinagrette- light and tangy. I ordered the trout for my entree and dad had the steak. I thought the fish was perfect, moist but the skin side was crispy, and it was topped w a whimsical array of small veggies. The steak was not amazing, but certainly good. Topped w blue cheese, an odd combo of mashed potatoes w broccoli buried inside. Dessert we opted for tiramisu and it was every creamy, espresso-y bit as good as I had hoped.

We went there last weekend after a long absence in the hopes that things were better. I have to say, the service was fantastic, and because of the Christmas decorations, the whole place was a bit brighter. Staff are friendly and helpful, and it's a stunning atmosphere to eat in. I ordered duck because I love duck - the waitress warned me that the chef tended to cook it \"until pink\". I stressed that I like poultry cooked through, but it arrived red at the center. She kindly took it back for me, and it re-appeared, now pink in the center. No way was it cooked through.I don't know who told a few Nashville chefs - the chef at Miel does the same thing - that they're cool if THEY decide YOUR food preferences - but I really resent it when I'm paying good money and ask for something specific, then get the chef's preference instead. I also don't know who decided that pork and poultry should be served rare, but that seems to be happening a lot here. I'm sorry; I don't care where the poultry comes from, or how carefully it's raised - I still like it cooked!I wish places like Mad Platter, Miel, City House (who serve rare sausage) would hire chefs who could also cook a \"normal\" meal.

It was \"national pizza day,\" or at least it was according to social media, so naturally my husband and I got a hankering for za.

I chose a medium 12\" gluten free crust, with vegan cheese, broccoli, sun dried tomatoes, garlic, artichokes, and shrooms. The pizza itself was actually really good. The sauce was yummy and the crust was tasty for GF. But the first thing I noticed was how SMALL my pizza was. Look, this is gonna seem ridiculous, and I'm not even embarrassed to mention that I did it, but I actually got out a measuring tape and measured my pizza. NINE INCHES. That is smaller than most small pizzas. For $12.99 with up to 5 toppings, that's a great deal, but if the menu says a 12\" medium, why is my pizza significantly smaller? I somehow had a few slices leftover for lunch the next day and it was even good reheated in the microwave at work. Just pretty disappointed with the size of the medium gluten free.

It's a bit sparsely decorated and there's not much ambiance, but I assume this is because Italia lives and dies by out-of-restaurant orders.Got all that? Good. Because once you get past all of this, there's an enjoyable pizza waiting to be had. I find the attention to detail creativity in the pizzas is what helps to set Italia apart from other places. I've already mentioned how unique the crust is. The pizza creations are pretty eventful as well. The first pie I tried here was the Mediterranean. The star of the show is the feta cheese which comes (as it should) crumbled all over the pizza. This is not a typical pie with melted mozzarella. Know this. With a red sauce base, the other toppings (garlic, tomato, \u00a0green peppers, onion, and chicken) were all very flavorful, fresh-tasting and plentiful. Never once did I have a slice that was all cheese and sauce. I tried my best to only eat half but I wound up destroying the whole medium. In an attempt to be healthy, I've also enjoyed the vegetarian pizza. Red sauce and a mozzarella provolone base make this more familiar to pizza goers. And, in truth, the toppings aren't terribly unusual (onion, green pepper, black olive, mushrooms tomato, and others if you ask; I asked for broccoli and hot peppers). But the blend of the cheese, sauce, crust, and toppings, again, make for a very enjoyable pie. I'm fully aware that Italia is more niche than some of the other pizza places in town but that rareness, in my opinion, adds to the enjoyment. Please note that the pizzas I described are the 'regular specialty' pizzas. They also offer, wheat crust, gluten-free and vegan options. A business can't be all things to all people but Italia is enough of the good to appeal to most of the people... and that's hard to beat.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 1642 reviews", "date": "2014-10-15"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nJohnathan B.\n", "review": "Got here late (around 22:00), great music in background, great waiter and wonderful food!The pizzas are great and delicious!If I would ever get back to Nashville, I would definitely visit this place again!", "location": "\nLas Vegas, NV\n", "exp": " 14 reviews", "date": "2014-10-23"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nKyle S.\n", "review": "Went in not expecting much more then a usual pizza pasta takeout place.

The mediterranean sampler is my favorite on the menu, and being Albanian who lives in NY and has been to Greece and had the finest Mediterranean cuisine possible, this certainly lives up to it. Grape leaves are nice and fresh, the hummus is awesome as well, definately has to be homemade as well as the olive oil, the pita bread is delicous, and the falafels are awesome too.

It is a lightly toasted butter pound cake, served with hot fudge, vanilla bean ice cream and caramelized bananas that is garnished with large thin chocolate chunks.

And while I adore branching out and trying things like Octopus, sunchokes, and variations of dishes, not everyone does. Some people like classic, delicious food without the frills, and Maggiano's fits the bill perfectly. I have taken my dad to a lot of local Nashville restaurants when he visits, and while he is polite and enjoys the food, it's just not always his cup of tea. So, when I was going through the lists of restaurants to take him for Father's Day, I knew he'd love Maggiano's. First of all, the restaurant is gorgeous and has fantastic ambiance. The bottom floor has private rooms with plenty of space for rehearsal dinners, corporate events, and anything else you fancy. Plus each room has it's own bar (win!) The restaurant is busy, so make reservations if you have a specific time that you want. There's seriously any number of ways that you can order. You can get your own entree, or you can get the family style offerings with a variety of choices. They have newly added a Light offering which was absolutely perfect for our table of 5 people. $20 per person gets you 3 appetizers (which are huge), 2 entrees, and lemon cookies for dessert. Perfect! We ordered the spinach dip, stuffed mushrooms, and Italian tossed salad. All of it was exceptional. Did I mention they are bottlomless and you can order as many refills as you'd like? You won't go hungry here, I promise. Since my dad doesn't eat red meat (I told you he is picky) we ordered the mushroom ravioli and chicken and spinach manicotti. They were delicious, but I especially enjoyed the ravioli. Mmmmm. It was excellent and we even took leftovers home!Special props to our server Andrew, who probably had 5 tables, each of them at least 5 people (one was more like 10 people). He was on top of it! I also appreciate that they have tons of food runners, people to fill your water glasses and clear plates as well. With all the food, they have to make room!

That being said, each course impossibly seemed to be better than the last. The complimentary bread was soft and delicious. We ordered the margarita flat bread which rivaled all but the top notch pizza joints and could have been a meal in itself. I was not able to limit furiously shoving the flat bread into my face even with the knowledge of 2 more courses imminent arrival. I ordered the lasagna. This was crafted from scratch by whom I can only assume are some kind of food warlocks that prayed to dark gods for their skills. This creation maintained the perfect proportion of crumbled meatballs, ricotta, pasta, cheese and sauce. It was like a Italian donkey kicked me in the face with his lasagna hooves. I was literally was in some hazy flavor induced state of zen meditation. But with out all the tedious work of meditating or fasting, just face stuffing. But I digress. I ate all the lasagna my body would allow and honestly prayed to the gods of old that the desert was small and not as delicious as the rest of this Italian food porno. The apple something something was huge and delicious much to my stomach's discomfort as I was powerless to stop shoving it into my grill. The vanilla ice cream was the perfect compliment to the crispy, flaky pastry layer filled with flavorful apples and drizzled with magic.

I was completely pleasantly surprised, however.,We went on a Saturday night and the ambiance was absolutely amazing. The restaurant is decorated for Christmas and gorgeous,and we were seated next to a live piano player playing Sinatra. Our server was incredibly helpful, and the food was great! If you order an entree from their classic pasta menu you get another full sized \u00a0classic pasta entree to go (all for about 13 bucks!). The great atmosphere,live music, and huge portions reasonably priced made this a must-visit again. The second time I went was even better. We weren't seated next to the piano player again (which I admit kind of bummed me out) but we did discover this amazing deal called Marco's Dining (or something like that). For two people you get an appetizer or flatbread, two entrees (plus the two you get to take home), and a desert for $40.

Finally we made the 2 1/2 hour journey to try it for the first time. I was very concerned that our anticipation of the evening would leave us disappointed. I was wrong. It met every expectation and exceeded it. Valet parking was inexpensive, (and my feet hurt) so we let them do the parking while we checked in for our reservation. We were in a group of seven and chose the family style dining. We had been told repeatedly that this was the way to go. Wow. Just wow. \u00a0The food was generously rolled out in courses with plenty of time between to digest and prep for the next course. Service was great. The waitress was attentive, but did not hover. We started with three appetizers. We chose the Italian salad (which four of the seven said was the best we've ever had), the mozzarella marinara (omg yum), and the sausage & peppers (a surprisingly delicious choice. My son (who is the pickiest ten year old on the planet), devoured the sausage and the mozzarella. Yay! Score! \u00a0The waitress asked us if we needed more appetizers brought out (um, NO, it's tempting but we still have a meal ahead). Next we chose four main courses: \u00a0the chicken Marsala (very tender, not too heavily wine tasting, deliciously cooked mushrooms, very tasty), peppercorn crusted sirloin (hands down my favorite...we ordered it medium, it came with mashed potatoes and was perfectly seasoned, juicy, tender, and delectable), the lasagna (huge and yummy, one of the teens said it was better than grandma's), and the spaghetti with meatballs (I'm not one to usually care for restaurant spaghetti, but this was good and my husband raved about it). Again, we were asked if we needed more! For our final course, we ordered the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the cheesecake. Both were the perfect finish, very, very good.

That might sound gross but trust me, this was music in my mouth. If the sausage is the bass, the peppers are tenor and the caramelized onions are the soprano voices.. the butter sauce is the cathedral that reverberates around them and melds it all into one angelic choir sound. *aaaaahh!*The chicken potato soup was a hearty explosion of chicken and veggies.

As you walk in from the front, the private dining rooms appear to be on the downstairs level, while the bar and regular dining room are up a long flight of stairs.This is where it gets to the bad part... We arrived on a rather busy night at 6:00 for a 7:00 reservation. We intended to wait in the bar area for our table. I started to explain this to the hostesses and got the rudest reaction I have ever received from a hostess anywhere about it, being told no, I'd have to wait until 7:00 in an obnoxious tone. Cracker Barrel's waitresses have more respect for customers than these little brats. So we shuffled over to the bar and sat down by the piano while we waited.Back to the good part...They had a guy playing the piano and singing, and he was absolutely incredible. We sat for a while drinking wine and listening to the piano, just soaking in the wonderful atmosphere. When the pianist took his break we mentioned our problems getting a table, and he arranged to get us seated right away right next to the piano. Totally made up for the bad hostess situation, saving me the trouble of having to complain to a manager.Our dinner arrived quickly and was fabulous, I had a ravioli special with braised veal, and my fiance had the pesto ravioli, which was also wonderful. I also highly recommend the bruschetta appetizer. We were going to head down to downtown to party, but as the restaurant began to clear out, we decided we were having such a good time that we stuck around until near closing. Everything about the night except for the hostess thing was magical. The bar staff didn't even mind when we took to dancing in the bar as the pianist played love songs.

As it turns out, my expectations were not too high!Maggiano's delivered! When you walk in, a giant foyer welcomes you with dark wood and creamy small tile.

Two things stuck out in my mind upon dining here: 1) They had a live piano player in the bar area that took requests and 2) They have 2 for 1 traditional pasta dishes. This means that you order one heaping pasta dish for $12.00 and you get a free pasta dish to take home with you free of charge. I would recommend the eggplant Parmesan (baked to perfection and layed between gooey Parmesan cheese), the four cheese ravioli in a white garlic sauce, the gnocchi in a tomato vodka sauce, or the Taylor Street baked ziti with scrumptious Italian sausage. All delicious!!!The tiramisu was selected as the one and only dessert option for it fulfilled my soul.

Looking around we noticed really lovely large booths being occupied only by couples. Since it was getting late, the dining room was clearing out. I mentioned my feelings on being cramped to Claire. She offered to move us to one of the vacant booths and took care of everything. We were able to relax and enjoy a really perfect family feast of stuffed mushrooms, caprese salad, fried mozzarella, the most tender and delectable chicken tortellini, Taylor Street rigatoni with sausage, chicken parm, and chicken saltimboca. The Spumoni ice cream was the finishing touch. We were so stuffed that the cheesecake was brought home and savored the following day. We can't wait to come back!

While there we ate out animmense amount, and I'm certain I gained 5 pounds. Alas, it was enjoyable and I hit up some absolutely delicious places.One of which was Maggiano's Little Italy in Nashville. I'm a big fan of ambience, and this place had it going on. Antique photos lined the walls, warm lighting welcomed you in and little signs of Italian culture were everywhere.Unfortunately, we decided to visit during the local prom night (yikes), which led to some waiting (starting with our 9 p.m. reservation). Our waiter wasn't seen very often, but it was obvious that he was quite busy, and not off in the back napping.We started with an order of garlic bread, and it was absolute nom. Anything garlic is usually win with me, but this stuff was particularly good.My friend's mom, Shirleen, was pleased. \"It's toasted to perfection, crispy outside yet still soft inside,\" she said.They also had the typical complimentary fair of bread and olive oil if you were in need of a more economical carb fix.The menu had everything you could want in the Italian food genre. Meals were offered at half and full portions. Note: do not get the full portion. It should be retitled the \"feed a small country portion,\" as I couldn't even finish my half-portion.I ordered the linguini and clams in a white sauce. While it was good, there wasn't tons of flavor and I was thinking (perhaps erroneously) that a white sauce equated to a white cream sauce. I got a garlic butter sauce, which was a little too light tasting, I think it could have been a tad heartier.I sampled with jealousy my accompaniment's food- which was all tots delicious.Shirleen got Chicken Spinach Manicotti and was very pleased.\"I liked how the chicken was finely shredded and the subtle taste of the ricotta cheese,\" she said.Her husband, Toe, wasn't quite feeling his Lobster fettucini.\"It's a little bit dry to me. The artichoke heart wasn't really good with it, but the hame was awesome,\" he said.None of us were able to finish our meals, showing how massive these \"half-sized\" portions were.The bill wasn't cheap- over $100, but that includes three huge entrees, two martinis, a sangria and a soft drink.

The atmosphere is pretty much like an upscale Olive Garden. Lots of \"warm Italian decor\" that makes you think of the 1920s in Italy or something. The music is piped in classic Italian songs. There's nothing necessarily exceptional about the atmosphere, with the gingham tablecloths and the mismatched lighting, but it's cute, if not completely novel.The food: we both ordered off the classic menu because they give you food free to take home (they basically let you pick anything off the classic menus and remake it for you to take home). With the average price per entree at $12, this is the way to go. Most of our other dining companions picked the same route, but the guest of honor got a seafood dish with mussels that was $20 and looked really yummy. Anyway-- I ordered the Bow tie Aglio: farfalle with brocolini, spinach, tomatoes and a light white sauce. I added chicken, and it was really good-- not too heavy and full of flavor. The husband got the Eggplant Parm-- he reported the eggplant was nice and meaty and the sauce was yummy. Our take home portions were the Ravioli that was topped with a cream sauce. It was like little discs of heart attack-worthiness, and it kind of was inedible (another of our dining companions got a tortellini that was much the same) and another one of the Aglio, but without the chicken. All in all, our server was attentive and kind, the take home free food seems like a good deal, but when you do the math and realize the meal cost like $3 to make, you better get some free stuff to go home with!

We entered the restaurant and saw no one. No customers, not staff, we though they might not be open yet, but soon a server came out and sat us. We picked the outside-ish patio that used to be open air but they've since enclosed it and it has garage door windows that can open if the weather is nice. Today was sunny and about 91 at 11am, so a HOT day. We skimmed the menu. I almost always get the burger with bacon and mushrooms. I was trying to decide between sushi or burger. The burger won out and we ordered a crunch shrimp roll to split as an appetizer. About the patio. It's nice if the windows are open and the weather is nice. They've got ac inside it, but there always seems to be a lot of flies in the patio. Those big, slow moving flies that always want to land on you, your food, your everything. I asked the server if we could go in and he said it was no problem. We picked a table up front. Our server was very friendly, which kind of surprised me. I've never had a rude server at PM, but my experience with PM and Blvd (another Arnold Myint establishment) is that the servers are always so blas\u00e9 and act like they really don't want to be there. It didn't take too long for our sushi roll to arrive. It was good, the amount of Panko crumbs in it is a lot. Like, you need to dip it in soy sauce or have a glass of water ready because it'll make your mouth dry and you might have difficulty swallowing. Reminded me a little of the saltine cracker challenge. The burgers arrived soon after. The burger is $9 and each topping is .50 cents. So my burger with bacon and mushrooms was ten bucks. I got the fries, which are huge steak fries with flake salt on them. So yummy. A side comes with the price of the burger. If you're looking to spice things up, order the red curry ranch with the burger. It goes well with it and it's even good to dip your fries in and it's no extra charge. My visit today was pretty good. The bacon on the burger wasn't warm, which was kind of a bummer but I guess it was prepared the day before seeing as how we were the first customers.

Veggie Mu Shu - Where the veggies were pretty good, the crepes, which are typically softer, chewier, and a bit more structured, were pretty bad. They fell apart and had a really bad texture altogether. I forewent them and just ate the veggies, which again, were fantastic. Veggie Lo Mein - Holy sesame oil, Batman! That's really all I can say.

They used the cheap break away chopsticks that didn't break evenly. The music was loud and distracting. Sitting outside leaves you victim to smokers. The food was barely passable and the sushi was old. I ordered the sashimi and what I got should not have been served. With a texture and taste so horrible it must have been going bad that evening. This place has such potential and I am sure the feeling behind its creation was pure but the food was barely passable.

I get the desire to avoid a uniform, but that doesn't mean that your staff can't at least be dressed professionally. When I'm greeted by someone wearing a hoodie and seated by someone wearing a stocking cap and a Titans t-shirt, I'm not sure who's an employee and who's a guest. You can avoid the uniform but still have a professional appearance. Second: Our waitress was friendly and great at suggesting menu items. Unfortunately it appeared she had absolutely NO experience using a two-step wine tool. I almost offered to open my own bottle of wine just to spare her the embarrassment of struggling with the bottle for nearly 5 minutes. Third: If you're going to participate in Restaurant Week, don't put menu items on your special menu that are so obviously an attempt to move inventory that otherwise doesn't move. I enjoyed my Seafood and Basil Stir Fry, but when I looked over your menu and saw the majority of the ingredients in the dish weren't located in any other dishes, it made me wonder just how fresh the ingredients were. Fourth: The desserts on the Restaurant Week menu were absolutely terrible. The Green Tea Ice Cream was so bitter, it just begged for some other ingredient to cut the bitter flavor. The Tempura brownie just tasted like a funnel cake with a low-quality brownie inside.I DID enjoy the sushi, and I imagine that's what keeps the place in business, as the majority of the patrons appeared to be Belmont students getting their sushi fix. Pick a niche and do it well, that will ensure the success of the concept. When you try to be everything to everyone you just end up truly pleasing no one. In short, PM is a great spot for sushi.

So when my friend and I needed a stop for our Friday night Restaurant Week adventure, we decided to enjoy the 3 course meal for $20.13 offered here!We were able to grab a table a little after 6pm and ordered the white and red sangria. YUM. Very tasty and a healthy portion for sure! Great start. We decided to have the shrimp spring rolls and moo shu quesadilla to start and wow, they did not disappoint! I loved the sauces on the side and we knew we were off to a solid start! For entrees we decided on the green curry with chicken and the salmon teriyaki with veggies. I ordered my green curry spicy, and it was even though the heat kinda floated to the bottom of the bowl. I have to admit I didn't love the broth, it seemed a bit watered down (maybe from all the restaurant week orders?) and I was let down. The salmon was good, and I definitely grabbed more than one bite from my friend's plate.For dessert I ordered the tempura brownie bite with caramel and my friend the coconut sticky rice with mango. Both were good but not great. \u00a0Probably wouldn't order it off the menu again. I always say that your appetizers shouldn't outshine the main course. I feel it should be a delicious and amazing build up to the grand finale that is your main dish. In this case, I was wishing I could have done a re-do of the appetizers. \u00a0What brought it down to 3 stars is that they rushed us out the door.

The Bisque was way flavorful and presented cleverly: Scallions on the top to mix the flavor up a bit and keep your tongue excited, scoop around for scallion-less yum, then I hit the bottom of the bowl where a mass of sour cream awaited me and shook up my soup experience again. I literally went \"ohhh...\" and made happy face. So smart, I had three flavor choices in one bowl! The Laotian Sausage Bites were also fabulous, with a great crisp I think pan fried in cashews they tasted spicy and pork-y and nutty all at once...plus they came on their own mini salad so you could again, flavor blend. I hated the sweet & spicy sauce that came on the side here - it made no sense to add - but it was on the side so I simply didn't add it.My friend got the Seafood Bi Bim Bop that I was also tempted by and that was very tasty as well. The neat thing is again - probably my favorite part now that I think of it - how it was presented left you the option to combine different parts of the plate to make different flavors so you never lost the flavor excitement, it was never a blur, the taste was always fresh! I hope that happens on all the meals here, it's like getting to share plates without sharing the flavors get so mixed up.Service was great, atmosphere is the now-standard cool, we stayed chatting for quite a while and no one made us feel like we should hit the road.

I agree with John S., that the PM Chargrilled Burger by itself deserves 5 Stars. It comes with Steak Fries or Sweet Potato Fries and Wasabi Mayo sauce. I usually added ketchup to the sauce, for some reason, it tasted better that way. For $5, the Thai Tea tasted average. Don't waste your money on it. Appetizer: I recommend the Coconut Calamari, which comes with 3 different sauces. My favorite is the one with the cucumber, tomato, and onion. The crunchiness of the veggie plus the sweet and sour of the sauce make this sauce sooo yummy! The other two are Siracha and Sweet & Sour sauce, which come from a bottle that you could purchase at any Asian supermarkets. The Laotian Sausage Bites are also very good (pork sausage, arugula, and walnuts with Siracha sauce). May be prices for pork went up, but the portion for this dish seemed gotten smaller compared to the first time I got it. Sushi: So far the only sushi roll I got was San Francisco roll. It seems the rolls at PM aren't fancy looking like at other restaurants but the SF roll I had was really good. Lunch: Shrimp Tempura with Ponzu is basically putting shrimp tempura and few slices of green onion on top of steam rice...even my guy friend knows how to make a better dish than that. Dinner: Sake Seared Salmon was average. I had better Salmon at Chill Spot (Delis) and that says something. Chinese Roasted Pork. AVOID AVOID AVOID. Man, this dish is an INSULT to Chinese food. I'm sure $3 cup noodles tastes better than this $15 dish. Egg noodles and roasted pork were gross. It tasted like bad microwaved food.

Bottom line, the sushi was awful. The fish was very low-quality, I bit into some yellowtail Nigiri and could not even bite through it. It was so tough it shredded in the process. Honestly, this is partially my fault for not checking out the menu prior to our visit. When we arrived we saw that probably 75% of the rolls contained \"krab stick\", and most were fried or had some sort of needless sauce on top. The kicker was the service. After trying a couple of bites of the sushi and pushing the plate to the side because it was pretty inedible, our server came by and asked how everything was. I informed him politely and discretely the sushi was not very good, he responded by saying \"okay... Sorry\" and wondering off without any further action. He didn't offer to replace the dish, he did not ask what was wrong with the dish, and he did not send anyone else over to handle the situation. To make matters far worse, when the bill arrived and the barely touched sushi still appeared on it, I flagged him down and pointed it out as politely as I could. He became flustered, waved his hands about, and said he couldn't do anything about that and he would send his manager over. To the managers credit, he was very polite and took care of removing it from the bill, but the server was so rude that I am still a little disappointed in myself for leaving the nominal tip that I did.The only reason I am giving two stars instead of one is some of the other dishes we ordered were fine, but really we only came here for the sushi, and what a disappointment.", "location": "\nSaint Louis, MO\n", "exp": " 20 reviews", "date": "2013-12-28"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nJuliet L.\n", "review": "PM is good in a pinch and I live in the neighborhood, so it's convenient. \u00a0Always feels a little sticky, though.

As always the host/hostess and wait staff are about as engaging as speaking with a wall. They seat you, but not without letting you know that you somehow are disturbing their evening, (are you not at work?) On to the food, I ordered the Thai chicken salad, pretty easy go since its a salad with sauce and chicken on top. I said I wanted no wonton puffs (making it gluten free). My wife orders her go-to which is the veggie burger, mind you we have had veggie burgers come out COLD before, but we were rolling the dice saying \"maybe this is a good trip, maybe they'll get it right\" 1st round :NOPE sure enough the burger comes out with no caramelized onions, and no wasabi mayo (something that is supposed to be on the side per how the dish is always presented) annnnnd my salad had wontons. SO we sent it back, both dishes. Round 2: they bring my salad out long before her veggie burger arrives the 2nd time and literally they picked off the wontons and covered the area up with shredded carrots. Pretty obvious because that dish never has that many carrots. Hers arrives with onions and her mayo, and we are thinking we are set and ready to go. NOPE it's ICE cold in the middle, ugh, by now its becoming laborious, so we sent hers back a second time. Round 3: Her burger comes out, obviously reheated because two wasabi peas that she left on her old plate came back out in the same spot on her \"new\" plate, the mayo was glazed over like it had been sitting under a heat lamp while they microwaved her burger. So we ask for the manager: He comes over and doesn't offer to comp her dish for the trouble we went through to even get to sit down and eat. He says he can take 1/2 off the burger on the bill. I don't know, but where I'm from, if a guest has to continually send food back because its done super half ass the whole time, you Mr restaurant owner/manager comp that dish, yes you suck it up, because you sucked that night, so you take a loss.

We luckily dined during 2 for 1 well drinks happy hour, where no corners were cut (drinks were not watered down, which can be typical for these types of happy hour). The food was delicious, overall. We were less than thrilled with the PM roll, but more because of our personal taste vs. the quality of the it. However, the San Francisco roll was great! The reasons we didn't give it five stars: our table did not have any direct lighting. As the sun set, the lack of lighting became obvious and a little distracting.

Read on for more... This place is situated in a really nice location in a great building. Huge patio, cozy indoor area with exposed brick and a great casual atmosphere. I feel like it's great for dates and nights out with the ladies. That being said, my brother and I went here because he's the Nashville resident and I'm the nerdy amateur foodie from California. We started off with the duck egg rolls per a quick tip and they were good. I think I would have like the duck cooked in fat a bit more, but they were satisfying. Loved the sauces, especially the spicy one. It's a nice break from the sweet chili sauce usually offered with egg rolls. We also had the edamame which was just OK. I'm used to boiling them in salt water, but our serving was kind of dry with salt tossed onto them. Then I had the seaweed salad, which is a favorite of mine in korean banchan. Pretty good with the cukes providing some crunch.We ordered 3 sushi rolls and the burger. The sushi was just meh. I told my brother it was like sushi baby food. Bland with no outstanding flavors. Even the wasabi didn't have a huge punch. The burger was outstanding, though paying extra for shredded cheese is a bit odd and the cheddar wasn't as sharp as I would have liked. The meat was great. The bun perfect. The wasabi-mayo was a bit weak, but the burger is the star. I think I would have liked them to assemble it into a more organized burger, but it's still great. I had a side of the wonton chips and I think if they were rolled a bit thinner, the chips would have had a lighter taste. No sauce or condiments for them. Not even any salt.This place has a lot of potential, but maybe it was an off night? I just thought it was OK. Maybe if I didn't have any sushi it might be 4 stars, but seems it is a solid 3. Apparently a 3 with a longer than usual review from me. Note #1: I sort of cringed at the prices of the main plates, but that's because bibimbap from ktown is about $10 with a ton of banchan.Note #2: I just realized this was another restaurant owned by Arnold Myint which it now sort of makes sense since I had a similar experience at Suzy Wong's.", "location": "\nLivermore, CA\n", "exp": " 351 reviews", "date": "2011-07-10"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nAndy J.\n", "review": "I went for some late night drinks with my girlfriend on Monday. \u00a0It was just what we were looking for... something off the beaten path, but still a 'real' place to get drinks. \u00a0They have great selection (including sake and locally brewed Yazoo! beers) and nightly deals/happy hours to help keep prices low.I didn't get the chance to eat the food, but if you're looking for somewhere to go out on a weeknight that won't feel empty or tacky check out PM.", "location": "\nChicago, IL\n", "exp": " 18 reviews", "date": "2012-03-06"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nMerritt G.\n", "review": "I am a big PM fan.

And more importantly they kept the sake flowing, and they had a nice selection of sparkling sakes to boot. Some were a lot more pricey than i was use to, i guess they can get by with that here because its a trendy place. All and all the food was good, the service was great... They even let us \u00a0 \u00a0sake bomb which i guess it is usually a no no since they don't want glasses getting broken. We were able to persuade the manager by letting him know we don't drop the glasses, we just pour the sake in to the beer directly. (you can use that tip, i can allow it this time) We will be back here for sure, its good to know we can get decent sushi out here... *sigh of relief*", "location": "\nOakland, CA\n", "exp": " 165 reviews", "date": "2008-04-30"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nMeredith C.\n", "review": "Here's something new and fresh: Asian fusion. \u00a0Maybe next they'll invent some sort of tiny, flavored balls of ice cream and serve them at sub-zero temperatures at water parks around the country. \u00a0I'm kidding!

A restaurant with a patio! And if the place also serves decent food and drinks? Well that's just a bonus!Thankfully, PM tics all the above boxes. I admit, I remember back in the day when it was Arnold Myint's only restaurant. Back then it was one of my favorite places in town. I loved the fresh take on Asian flavors, and its greatest appeal to me was the abundance of small plates that can easily make up a filling and well-rounded meal when eaten in combination with one another. The much lauded burger was really good (though the fries were crappy), and this was my go-to place. But. Then for some reason, service and food quality seemed to go down, and after one particularly underwhelming (and when thinking about the sushi, downright unappetizing) meal, my husband and I abandoned PM and instead devoted ourselves to Suzy Wong's.Still, the patio at PM beckoned us as the arrival of Spring enticed us with the prospect of al fresco dining. I called ahead to make sure our pups would also be welcome--which they are (the woman seemed surprised that I would even ask)--and then our little family of four headed over. We did have to wait for about 30 minutes for a table on Friday night, but that is only because we had to sit outside with our dogs. The atmosphere was lively and everyone seemed to be having a good time, except for our waitress, who was a bit surly when we were finally seated. Don't know what that was about, but her mood did improve as the night went on. She also didn't seem put off that my husband and I just wanted to share a bunch of small plates rather than order mains.What can I say except that after a one year absence on our part, the food was even better than we remembered it. The pickle chips and duck spring rolls (two of our favorites) were amazing, and the chicken peanut salad that we split was also super refreshing and tasty. Not only would we order all of these again, we're trying to think of the next chance when we can return and do so. Also, I got a gimlet of some sort, which was like the most delicious lemonade you have ever had. It may have been a tad pricey at $9 but it was so good. The thing I love about PM is that the prices really do seem reasonable given the portions and the quality of the food. The one notable exception is the sushi, which just really isn't Arnold's forte. The fish always seems hacked apart by shoddy knife work, and it's just not that tasty... Stick to the warm food options (or the salads) and you'll be a happy camper as you dine in style.Another added bonus to this place (as well as Suzy Wong's) is that there are plenty of tasty options for people on restricted diets.

When you were a regular presence, the lettuce was fresh, the cucumber wasn't frozen. The sashimi didn't present as slabs of glossy flesh hacked out of a mountainside of fish, like strip mining at its worst. Where are you?!My family loves PM. We revel in the atmosphere. One of our favorite things about it is the wonderful cross-section of humanity represented here, from elderly folk who've lived in the Sterling Court Apartments forever, to young almost-hip Belmont students. But lately, it's gone awry.Perhaps it's the new menu? When first ordered a few years back, the seaweed salad was the best in town, and highly unusual - wonderfully delicate strands of seaweed sitting atop mounds of dulce and ocean greens I have yet to identify. Never greasy, always large enough for two. Now, it comes drowned in sauce - though I have to say, if ordered with the disclaimer \"Please make sure it isn't drowning in sauce\", most of the waitrons will drain it. Still, it's nowhere near the surprisingly fabulously huge and delicate repast we were used to.Perhaps it's the sashimi? I'm not sure who trains Arnold's sushi chefs, and I realize this is not per se a Japanese restaurant, but if you're going to serve sushi, have a bit more respect for the fish! The chirashi is great value, no argument there - enough for two, at least - but I personally would prefer not to have to cut my sashimi into thirds and fourths before it fits in my mouth. What's the point of sashimi, if not the delicacy and the enjoyment of a succulent mouthful that melts on the tongue, rather than huge pieces with gristle and fat still clinging to them, interrupting all taste sensation with overkill?Nashville has some of the best Vietnamese restaurants in the country, which begs the question - why on earth advertise \"Vietnamese spring rolls\" and then present these dried up wallflowers, with a sauce that plainly comes straight out of a bottle? Kien Giang at its worst could do better!The final insult? the \"salad\" served on the side of the fabulous Thai wrap. The wrap itself is a thing of beauty, perfectly balanced, but the \"salad\" that accompanies it is a disgrace. We ordered it for the third time tonight, and it was no better than the other times - the lettuce had been sitting far too long, the cucumber slices looked like they'd been frozen, and over-all, the entire thing could have used some serious attention.Patty Myint was there tonight, and I wih I'd taken the opportunity to show her my \"salad\" - the brown, curled lettuce edges, the barely-defrosted ice on cucumber slices. The daub of wasabi next to my sashimi, with an outside crust proving it had been sitting far too long. But to be honest, I didn't have the nerve. This woman has single-handedly re-shaped Nashville's dining - why bother her with minor details?I love PM, believe it or not. It's in my district. It's kid-friendly, and the outdoor seating is lovely. Those of you following my reviews know we used to go to Shintomi, but no more - so where to go for sashimi in the 'hood?

Two words: Lunch special. You get to choose between two different sushi rolls, where I usually go with my usual California and Spicy Tuna, and you get eight of each! On top of that you get a salad and miso soup for a grand total of nine dollars. I mean, seriously, I can't think of a better offer. The fruit tea is excellent, so I'd recommend that as far as drinks go, and if it's dinner time, grab the snake roll. If it's warm out, use the patio, it's a great seating area. Especially if you get a table along the side, it offers some privacy if you're the only ones back there. If you don't feel like eating in, or out at PMs, you can call in your order and go pick it up.

Blessedly, we managed immediate seating (the place was jumping) and were told at the host's stand that had we arrived five minutes earlier, would have been waiting over an hour for a table. Good thing I got a little lost on the way.Two of my friends spotted the Sumo Drink on the menu and shelled out $15 for their cocktails in a porcelain likeness of a sumo wrestler. Cute. My friend and I stuck with plain glasses for our $9 cocktails - I ordered a white sangria and my friend ordered a lychee lemonade cocktail, both of which were excellent. The service was decidedly slow, and for some reason the waitress couldn't grasp the concept that we wanted straws in our waters, but all things considered for a Friday night, she was very pleasant. We decided to all go in on a massive sushi order, and probably wound up with 9 or 10 rolls between the four of us. Everything was wonderful. I always lean toward spicy sushi, and am often disappointed when some sushi chefs squirt on a drizzle of Sriracha instead of making an actual spicy sauce, but I was not disappointed in the sauce at PM. I'd have to look at the menu again to tell you exactly what we got, but the Florida Roll was a definite standout. \u00a0 \u00a0Between four people with more than one cocktail apiece, including two overpriced sumo glasses, a smattering of very satisfying sushi and an appetizer, our check came to $108.

(no one has asked if my food was as ordered, etc) until another waitress simply brings the check. \u00a0I ask for a refill, she offers a to-go glass, and about ten min. later, I get it. \u00a0For the first time in my life, I did not leave a tip, as I went for the majority of my meal without a beverage (and usually, they are so good at refills) and clearly felt as though I was a burden to the staff by being there alone. \u00a0I don't mean to be overly critical, but it's hard to enjoy rather spicy chili without anything to drink, even water! \u00a0The place was packed and I would have been happy to sit at the bar, had they insinuated that to be more appropriate. \u00a0I also would have been more understanding of the slowness, had it not been to spend 30 seconds putting ice and tea in a glass. \u00a0I noticed two other waitress at tables near mine who wished the patrons a Happy Valentine's Day, told them of the soup (I had to ask), brought multiple refills, inquired how their food tasted, asked if they wanted dessert, etc, but I unfortunately didn't get any of that.Just a disappointing experience...especially when eating alone on Valentine's Day was a little awkward as is!", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 5 reviews", "date": "2015-02-14"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nJean W.\n", "review": "I was there this month for the first time and it was great. \u00a0 I ordered the Scottish salmon and was so glad I did. \u00a0It was the best I ever had. \u00a0A small container of sauce accompanied it and it was good as well. \u00a0I didn't order any sides and I'm glad I didn't. \u00a0 The salmon was served with a heaping amount of an interesting combination of corn, beans, raisins and other ingredients. \u00a0It sounds awful, \u00a0but trust me it was very tasty and I couldn't stop eating it. \u00a0The drinks were generous and strong. \u00a0 \u00a0One of our party had a Manhattan and it came not only as an adequate amount in a glass, it also had a buddy along with it - the rest of the drink was in a small cylinder resting in another glass of cold-water. \u00a0Apparently you get the full-measure. \u00a0Another companion ordered the prime rib and pronounced it excellent. \u00a0The salads were huge. \u00a0 \u00a0Service was pleasant and efficient. \u00a0In summation, enough of an overall food experience to return.", "location": "\nCookeville, TN\n", "exp": " 4 reviews", "date": "2015-07-20"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nMiranda P.\n", "review": "Wonderful meal and very nice atmosphere.

You have met your match! \u00a0J.Alexanders so happens to be the stepsister of Houston's. You can definitely tell by the restaurant's style and ambiance.

I'm a regular at Houston's in Irvine,ca, been going there since I was in preschool and I \u00a0completely adore the food both have to offer but J.Alexanders sadly has overtaken Houston's throne in my book! This one of the main reason why I love coming to Tennessee on my vacations. I was introduced to J.Alexanders back in the late 90s by my Grandparents, they always raved about this place and they so happen to eat here after church every Sunday. \u00a0The first time I came to this \u00a0place, I fell in love with it and I felt right at home(since they had almost everything I would get a Houston's). I always used to get their chicken tenders(which are delicious), but now that i'm older I have moved on to other things. For a starter, I \u00a0always get their \u00a0Caesar . One of the best \u00a0Caesar Salads I've ever had in my life, \u00a0They give you a great portion, and I deeply love the creamy garlicky dressing tossed in the salad topped with \u00a0the \u00a0their Parmesan cheese and \u00a0fresh hot deep fried croutons . It's to die for! \u00a0I may warn you,the salad portions here are huge!!! A side salad is \u00a0equivalent to a dinner salad, i'm not joking one bit. \u00a0These Salads here make the Houston's side salads look as small as \u00a0those \u00a0$1.00 salads at Wendy's. The true highlight of this place in my opinion is their Danish Baby back ribs! Much like Houston's, these are Fall out of the bone fork and knife ribs and they are smothered \u00a0in their tasty Plum Creek \u00a0B.B.Q sauce(which is slightly sweeter than Houston's), it's Coleslaw(I always substitute for their shoestring \u00a0fries) and Tequila beans! Both side dishes definitely add to the meal making it delicious beyond words! These ribs have taken the Crown from Houston's! The only thing this place doesn't have is the out of this world Chicago Spinach dip!

I don't wish to complain; they weren't bad but if I had wanted to go to hear a band play, I would have gone to a bar. I went there with a large group, and was supposed to have a set menu but a few of us went off piste and ordered appetizers. I'm so glad that we did. The beignets were lovely and creamy and the lobster and crab were seriously tasty. The fried oyster had been obliterated by the cooking process and was just a hard lump of batter. The chicken samosa was good. The entrees were not so good. The steak came with a weird sauce and no sides.

We ordered the bucca beignets, bruschetta, garlic cheese bread, caprese salad, and the house salad to start! All was very very good. The kids enjoyed is all as well. We asked Jordan about the pinot noir selection. He suggested a few but pushed one more so based on our palate. We tried 2 tastings both were good. We trusted our server and order the Meomi Pinot Noir he suggested. He nailed it. It was a delicious bottle! My husband also order a sweet tea, where Jordan told us they didn't have any but could bring some sweetener. A couple minutes pass and he returns with the iced tea and fresh made hot simple syrup! He went above and beyond to get us our sweet tea! He just set the tone for the rest of the night.

The food, however, leaves me perplexed.Food is my primary measure for evaluating a restaurant, but I have to take a moment to comment on the ambiance of this place. With its generous use of draped red and purple cloth and weird light fixtures. The interior design is sort of how I would imagine what an upscale Turkish brothel would look like. I can't say that that's either a good or a bad thing, but it's certainly interesting. I have to say, though: I am all for mood lighting, but this place is exceptionally dim. At one point, I watched a waiter forced to identify a soup by using a flashlight. If the lighting is bad enough to interfere with your employees' ability to do their jobs, I think it's time to go back to the drawing board.As for the food, I was pretty optimistic after the first course: the bisque was well-balanced and quite tasty. Furthermore, their side-dish, prosciutto mac&cheese, was remarkably light. I thought I was headed for a thoroughly 4-star meal, but alas, it was not to be. I admit that I broke one of my own commandments of restaurant eating, which is \"Don't order a chicken breast or a pork chop unless someone has specifically recommended it.\" As punishment for my sins, I spent my evening chewing through an overcooked, though relatively well-seasoned, pork chop. Remarkably, they managed to pull off the opposite feat with their vegetables. Now, I prefer many vegetables, like broccoli and carrots, to be on the \"al dente\" side. However, bell peppers and onions do NOT fall into this category: it was remarkably bitter. I will say, though, that because they were undercooked it made for good eating the next day after I nuked them in the microwave. I didn't try too much of my tablemates' food, but at least two folks commented that the lobster enchiladas were not particularly lobster-y and that the portions were a bit stingy.This meal showed some moments of promise, but I was expecting a bit more.

A pixie blonde gal on her piano, belting out covers and originals with her band. She's got some pipes on her!So conversation doesn't come easy, except between sets, but what it lacks in chill it totally makes up for in eats. They specialize in mostly seafood and steak type fare. Surf and turf type stuff, if you will. And they do it VERY well. Our table started out with a round of appetizers. Most noteworthy were the goat cheese stuffed artichokes and the crab queso dip. Damn, they were good! I also enjoyed the calamari although they did get soggy pretty quickly. For the main course I enjoyed the chili rubbed scallops with little bits of risotto cake underneath each scallop. Holy wow! This was great. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the risotto has this nice smokey flavor that I really enjoyed. In the middle was a veggie medley of some asparagus, peppers, onions, etc. Fresh and also with a bit of a smokey taste. Loved this!

They've got a nice variety of cocktails, including some in a category called \"skinny bitch\" which, as you can imagine, are a bit lighter in caloric content. Nice!

Someone may need to tell him to take it down a notch though...I was very impressed with the Broccoli Crunch ($5.50) which was a perfect balance of texture with broccoli, apples, walnuts, and a savory sauce. I am craving this side-dish as we speak! I also ordered up the Fire Roasted Vegetables ($5.50) which were suitable but nothing remarkable.

To add to it, I was pushing for dinner at the much maligned City House but live music was the choice of the group. Off to dinner we went.We walked in and asked for a seat on the large patio. With the sun setting, the music being played and the warm spring air, I rather enjoyed my 2.5 hour dinner. Slowly sipping on a beer, I could have sat there another hour enjoying life. But all good things must come to an end. We started with the grilled garlic cheese bread and the bruschetta. The cheese bread is clearly for lovers of cheese but the bruschetta had wonderful flavor. The tomatoes were bright and flavorful and even the raw tomato haters in the group were getting seconds. This was a hit.For dinner I went with the pork chop. Presentation of the food was picture worthy with my bone in chop resting on a pile of mashers and a large helping of grilled veg on the side. Not listed on the menu, the sauce they use on the pork chop is very smoky. This isn't a bad thing but it's not what I was looking for and wish I'd known. The grilled veg was wonderful on this warm night and the mashers were downed rather quickly. For dessert we split the caramel bread pudding with vanilla ice cream.

Even when it's cold outside, the decor of Sambuca is also gorgeous and perfect for an intimate date or private party. Drinks- Brent had two beautiful 1/2 price cocktails: Skinny Bi*%# Pink Lemonade (HH $5) and the Effen Sangria (HH $5.50). I order the house Riesling (HH $4.75) which was so dry and bitter, that I couldn't finish and gave the rest to Cole. The bartender offered to make me a specialty drink to my taste (he said all bartenders there will) so I had a pineapple margarita without sweet and sour mix (HH $5). This is probably my new go to drink and was a hit with all 3 of us! Cole had my leftover dry Riesling and a glass of the house Merlot ($4), which is always a sure bet.Food - We sprung for 2 orders of the Garlic Bread ($2.25 HH and perfect to share), Margherita Pizza ($5.50), and the Chicken and Beef Satay ($4.75). The bar food and appetizers are good, especially for the price, but definitely aren't the main attraction at Sambuca.

The mojitos at Sambuca were the best I've had since San Fran, no doubt. They used enough fresh mint and not too much sugar to make it just right. The music wasn't outstanding nor was it bad. It was fine for background music while you eat.

Well, I would say it is just ok. I would rather go to Sams for happy hour and get two for ones for the way we were treated. It's funny that most of the other reviews all had similar things to aay about service. I had 2 of the skinny bitchy drinks and they were decent for low cal cocktails. I did not eat but had a bite or two off of friends plates and the food seemed pretty good. I work as a an aspiring chef and I enjoyed the bites I had....however, the service was AWFUL!!Maybe I am jaded because I work in the industry, but I have worked here and there and believe I know the difference in good, average and bad service. I try not to be overly picky so as not to annoy my non \"industry\" friend but even they started asking me if certain things the service was doing was normal and they believed it was poor as well. It started at the front door. I had never been there before and I walk in to 3 people at the hostess stand.1 male obviously flirting with the 2 ladies and he has his back to me. I stand there for an awkward second or two and no one acknowledges me, so I proceed to ask them if I am to find the people I am meeting and they all point towards the main dining area...no help there. I find my friends....our server comes by at least 4 times in 10 mins....sounds great right? No, never once asked me what I wanted to drink clearly being I was late to join as my friends were a drink or two in. the story continues with the classic forgetting of the orders even though she had to walk 2 feet to the computer to ring it in..she even told us she was super forgetful,...so why not write it down?? She got very annoyed that we tried to order a few drinks each ruby before happy hour ended. another pet perverse of line that they seem to execute very well was their food runner. I work in a restaurant where there is a food runner. the reason they get paid and tipped out is to take care in placing each order.3 times my table ordered food and all 3 times, he just threw it down on the table with no care as to a seat number. \u00a0he didn't even do the old school polite thing of \"who had the pizza?\" \u00a0He just through it all down in front of whomever. now if we had told the server we would all be sharing then no big whoop but they clearly all ordered individually. Lastly, when we were finally leaving, again 3 people at the door and one very near the door, no one opened it for us to leave nor did they acknowledge we.were.leaving at all....not a single word...which to me is an eff you, eff them. its unfortunate, bc my bill was 10 bucks and the menu did look intriguing. it really makes me mad when one part of a restaurant can ruin it for the other. the problem is, I would go back to a place with mediocre food if it had great service, but bad service and ill skip the food that looks enticing...i feel for their BOH....bottom line don't waste your time or your tip...those people don't care....", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 5 reviews", "date": "2011-02-25"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nSu A.\n", "review": "tasty martinis, good apps; GREAT service!", "location": "\nWoodstock, GA\n", "exp": " 33 reviews", "date": "2013-02-19"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nMeredith C.\n", "review": "For this place to be a chain, I was impressed. \u00a0Outstanding beignets.

I've tried several of the espressos offered, all of which have been incredibly smooth. My favorite has been the Sightglass, but to my knowledge, Barista Parlor switches out their espresso menu every now and then. In regards to food, I've tried the strawberry poptart and chocolate waffle, both of which were good afternoon treats.

In the center is the lone cash register and the stations where they make the beverages. Hugging the walls, there are several seating options-- some meant to seat two, others meant to seat more.

You think these breakfast staples can only be done a certain way, but every ingredient was top notch. The bread soft without being mushy, the bacon was thick and juicy, the cheese smooth. Nice serving size to leave you full but not stuffed. My drink, per usual, was an iced mocha. To my delight, they used dark chocolate I believe. Such a great smooth flavor, not too sweet, not bitter. We finished off with a small chocolate glazed covered donut. There was a marshmellow in the center-- and it was all delicious!I picked up some of the fancy chocolate bars they had to bring back as gifts for friends. Pretty good selection of sizes and flavors.I know there'll be some gripes about the prices, but honestly, it's worth it for the kind of experience I got here.The staff was super friendly. The cashier spent some time talking to us since we said we were from out of town. The single menu and point of check out is awkward, but it does keep the place from feeling cluttered. My girlfriend acceidently dropped a plate of food and it broke on the ground. A staff member promptly cleaned it up and told us not to worry. A new treat on the house! Everything about this place screams hipster, and that's OK. They own it, and execute it well. You can tell a lot of thought went into branding this establishment, and I always appreciate places that go the extra effort.

Barista Parlor is awesome. I get that the menu is a bit confusing, and it can be slightly intimidating to ask a question, but just ask them if you are confused. I promise they won't bite. They sell different varieties of espresso on the bottom left side of the menu, and then you can add your milk option of 4oz - 16oz, depending upon what kind of drink you want. They also have an entire list of specialty drinks and the food is great, though it can take some time to come out. For food, the in house made poptarts are delicious for a sweeter treat, and the macaroons are awesome as well. The oatmeal is a HUGE portion, so much that I couldn't eat all of it, and was filled with fruit, nuts, and I'm not sure what else, but it was amazing. The biscuit sandwich is also excellent (but go for the bacon variety not the sausage). Open your mind a bit when you come here and don't expect a Starbucks.

With speed and clarity I jumped out of my vintage leather sofa and threw my favorite pair of Imogene & Willie jeans in the freezer. I oiled my beard, donned my favorite fedora, laced up my work boots and headed out of my studio apartment that my Dad pays for. The journey to Golden Sound wasn't without it's perils as a lot of drivers in this city fail to take notice of my vespa, but I made it safe and sound. Upon arrival, I realized how unassuming the location was, it made me feel like I had stumbled upon a secret that only myself and every other remotely cool person in Nashville knew about. When I walked through the door my heart swelled with excitement as I heard the familiar sounds of coffee being ground and saw handcrafted beverages being delivered to patrons on tiny wooden planks. I wondered to myself if maybe the wooden planks had once belonged to a farm owned by Willie Nelson, but my attention was diverted when I noticed the vintage record player on one of the shelves spinning. As the needle scratched across the vinyl none other than the voices of the bearded gods known as the Fleet Foxes rang throughout the room. It was then that it hit me like a ton of novelty mustaches that I had found my mecca, the place that I could enjoy coffee and sit in quiet judgement of my peers. I found a place of acceptance, not acceptance because we're all different but because we're all trying desperately to be exactly the same. Finally a place where I can be me, where I won't get funny looks because I'm working on a vintage typewriter and an iPad at the same time. A place to give 34% of my weekly earnings. I chuckled as frustrated tourist came in and left instantly when they realized they weren't at a Starbucks and that they couldn't get their 10 pump White Mocha with extra whip. I also overheard conversations that I know will go on to shape the future of our world, like one couple's deep discussion on the consistency of hummus and it's effect on their lunch choices. After finding a place to sit at the ridiculously long and thin wooden table. I hung my man satchel on one of the tiny wooden stools (which instantly fell to the ground) and went on a search for the magical spot where one places an order. Ten minutes later after discovering that the registers were actually just iPads, I picked up a menu plank and ordered an Ethiopian coffee. The girl working behind the counter's voice was like an angel when she asked me how I would like my coffee brewed. Ah, options! I love options. I chose the option to have it poured from a three-story balcony. It was at that point that I realized I'd not eaten anything in 2.5 days so I checked out their wide range of pastries and chocolates. I ended up going with the artisan pop-tart. What can I say... I just like it when one homemade pop-tart costs as much as three boxes of regular pop-tarts. I also ordered the Moto bacon, egg and cheese biscuit - obviously named after Mr. Moto the fictional Japanese secret agent created by the American author John P. Marquand.After waiting only a short amount of time, my coffee, biscuit and the artistic pop-tart were delivered to me on one of Willie's planks by a bearded man wearing an apron that I can only assume he stole off of a blacksmith in the 1800's. We had a few moments of small talk about Edison bulbs and moon landings. Both the coffee and the pastries were delicious, I even saved some in my beard for later!

Offerings were 3 types of bao, sweet drinks, and that's it. We tried the crawfish, onochicken, and hoisin cabbage. The bun has a bit of a sticky mouth feel, which I did not love, but the fillings, for the most part, were delicious. The crawfish filling was spicy and chewy, and the chicken filling was salty and flavorful. The cabbage filling was very tangy, and we missed the wood ear mushrooms that were listed in the description. The little filled steamed balls make a perfect lunch when you're out and about, as they're easy to eat and not messy at all.Three bao and a bottle of water totaled $13 even. I think $3 may be a more reasonable pricepoint for each bao (each one is $4 now, or 3 for $11). Still, Bao Down is basically capitalizing off of the fact that bao is not easy to come by in Nashville, so they can really charge whatever they want. I don't know how Bao Down compares with bao offerings around the nation, but I'm glad to see them bring this dish to Nashville. I'd throw them a fourth star if they brought the price down a smidge.

Granted, there's only 4 tables in the place, so they were at 25% capacity. They've only got one server here & one sushi chef. For she small size of the place, I guess that works.

I ordered the spicy tuna roll ($6.49) & the crunchy shrimp roll ($6.99).

NOT SO! \u00a0You had me at miso.Next you served me a calamari salad after informing me that the tiny octopus was not available. \u00a0And what did I think? \u00a0Well, again, if we're being honest I first thought you were being a little stingy with the meat until \u00a0I inserted your vibrant colorful, crispy, and complex salad into my mouth... WOW. \u00a0Doooon't........ Stoooop......... Doooon't........ Stoooop........ Don't stop! {ahem}..Sorry.Halfway through my teriyaki chicken, steamed shrimp dumplings, and just as my first dish of maki arrived I began to feel inadequate. \u00a0I felt under dressed and embarrassed that I had ordered a coke when every dish that you gave me was beautifully presented and tasted amazing. \u00a0Yes, I said it.. you tasted amazing. \u00a0So much so that I almost used the four letter word that most guys wouldn't touch even after 10 dates. \u00a0I will admit, that I was beginning to fall in love. \u00a0sigh. \u00a0Did I mention that the rice was perfectly cooked, \u00a0the seaweed was not overwhelming, the fish was tastefully fresh, and the flavors in my dish were complex and masterfully put together? \u00a0If I didn't, it was only because I felt small and insignificant in my grey hoodie and Dansko clogs. \u00a0I really should have dressed up for our first meeting!!As I left it was difficult for me to say goodbye. \u00a0Although you are small, unadorned, and have very little possessions I was very impressed. \u00a0I felt that I had finally found a long lost friend. \u00a0How did you get to Nashville? \u00a0How did you get to a tiny little hole in the wall off of Stewart's Ferry Pike is the better question? \u00a0Can I just say that I haven't had Japanese food of this quality since I left the big city of Chicago? You are so humble, \u00a0but seriously... you are amazing and \u00a0technically the best sushi in the city. \u00a0I mean that.Maybe we were destined to meet. \u00a0Whatever, the reasons we are now connected you and I. \u00a0One day I suspect you will leave me, \u00a0I know that I am not worthy of a world class meal from you everyday but until that day comes I will live fully and I will cherish every moment that we have together. \u00a0I can't wait till I see you again!Sincerely,Your Sushi Lover", "location": "\nMt Juliet, TN\n", "exp": " 47 reviews", "date": "2014-03-08"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nKaleena 'Kala' H.\n", "review": "My husband and I live down the street from here, so we decided to get takeout one evening.

The server brings her beer and she asks for a mug and at this point we knew what we wanted but he went to get the mug first and it literally no lie took about 15mins. The mug tasted like straight up dish soap. While she waited for the mug I noticed on my second beer there was some goop on it so I went to the bar to swap it out and that's where another problem laid. Three servers sitting waiting for drinks and a very slow inattentive bartender. Luckily a second bar tender saw me waiting and apologized and swapped out my beer for me.

We were looking to have some beers, hang out, and eat dinner, and I wasn't sure what to expect. Our wait for a table was estimated at 45 minutes (ending up being closer to 60-75 minutes) and so we ended up spending time in the bar area, which was packed - not surprising considering the deals they had going. By the way, when they say 2-for-1, it's literally that...NOT 1/2 price drinks. You order a beer, you get two. We were seated out on the patio, which was partially enclosed. I don't know if they move heat lamps out there ever, but they'll eventually need to or that space will be worthless. We ordered the garlic bread, fried ravioli, bruchetta, and chicken wing appetizers. I liked the ravioli but the garlic bread and bruchetta breads were weird - thick and block-like, like a cake, and dry. If I had really thought about the 2-for-1 deal, we would have ordered a bunch of slices of pizza, but instead we ordered four pizzas: a plain pepperoni (I think), the brass knuckles (buffalo chicken), the fedora (kalamata olives, mozzarella, and basil pesto), and the last request (veggies plus pepperoni, salami, and italian sausage, and jalapenos for an extra kick). The last request was my favorite by far. The veggies and meat were flavorful and the jalapenos gave it that extra boost. The fedora was bland except for the overwhelming salt from the olives - couldn't really even taste the basil pesto. I'm also not a fan of how thin the crust was...it was the kind of pizza and size of slice that you have to fold to be able to eat (unless you're going to use a knife and fork). Overall, we had a TON of food - no need to order four large pizzas for 7 people. The price wasn't horrible, but that was due to the 2-for-1 drink specials rather than the prices of the pizzas. Again, we had a ton of food, but it's not the kind of pizza I'd go for if I were ordering for myself, and the combos weren't that impressive, with the exception of the last request.

It's been one of my go-to spots for a number of years, both for dine-in and carryout.Appetizers range from traditional (antipasti, Caesar salad, pasta e fagioli) to the inventive (e.g. Vinny's Maccheroni: elbow mac, cheddar cheese, diced fresh jalapenos, presented as breaded deep fried bricks, and served with a spicy vodka sauce for dipping... YUM!).The pastas are also good, offering large portions, but for me, this place is about the pizza (and Peroni).The thin (but not crispy) dough has a wonderful slight sweetness and chew to it. From there, you'll find a broad range of premium toppings and sauces, again ranging from traditional to designer. Build your own or try one of their specialty pies. My favorites are the Dolan (spicy BBQ chicken, and I add fresh jalape\u00f1o), the Irate Italian (black olive and garlic), and the Brass Knuckles (buffalo chicken and bleu cheese).Service is generally good, though on a few occasions it's been a little slow, due mostly to volume.

I went and picked Tony up at the apartment and we head for 12 South to try out Mafiaoza's Pizzeria and Neighborhood Pub...we heard it was pretty good location and pretty good food. \u00a0They have a large parking lot in the back of the eatery with a back entrance. \u00a0We made our way it through the rear and went to the hostess station at the front of restaurant. \u00a0We were seated immediately near the front window...love their tables and booths. \u00a0There is a great bar area and a heated patio area in the winter/ open in the summer. \u00a0The interior is large and airy, but not crazy about the interior design. \u00a0I do like the open bar sitting area in front of the kitchen where you can watch the cooks toss the dough while making the pizzas and cooking the pasta. \u00a0Our waiter Chris was very pleasant and immediately greeted us at our table. He asked if we had ever been here before and we stated that we were Newbies...and he said \"Let me give \u00a0you a tour of our menu...starting in the front\"...and he went over the different sections, giving recommendations from each section. \u00a0I have to admit it was engaging and informative. He made personal recommendations and gave details about the different appetizers and entrees...I really knew I wanted Pizza but his description of the. appetizers and the salads, pastas, etc., I almost changed my mind.But Tony and I decided to get a large \"The Last Request\" ....fully loaded. They have two sizes Capone = Medium and Don \u00a0= Large...so we opted to get the Don for only $27 knowing that we would have plenty of leftovers for the next \u00a0day. \u00a0It was very good, I have to admit it was a little burnt but they are cooking with a large brick open fire oven..it didn't take long and Chris was bringing it to our table..It is huge!!Tony ordered two Pabst Ribbon Beer and I ordered a soda ( Coke ) I think....We enjoyed the meal. The bar area was lovely with a Christmas tree that is decorated really gorgeous. \u00a0I enjoyed the pizza very much but it was a little dry without enough sauce. \u00a0It could have used a little more cheese...I still prefer the Zeus from Five Points on the East End. \u00a0I will definitely go back here again to try out their pasta and salad with some killer wine..I checked out their extensive wine list and was very impressed. I want to try this one which is a sauvignon blanc wine from New Zealand, called Lonely Cow...which was pineapple and tangerine blend...sounded good I want to try it...The dinner check wasn't bad. \u00a0I paid the tab $45 with taxes and tip..and I tipped Chris 17 1/2 percent...he was awesome...I enjoyed him...I wish I had felt better, I would have loved to have tried that wine this evening...

I've been in a few times now and I can say without reservation that they're one of the better options for pizza+Italian dining in Nashville. The food isn't the greatest, nor is the service. However, their deals and ingredients will keep me coming back. I especially like their 2-4-1 Tuesday nights; You can get slices and draft beers 2-4-1. They pre-slice and pre-sauce their slices, so if you're wanting something without red sauce, you're out of luck. However, they execute well and quickly. Sometimes they execute too quickly. I always order their charcuterie board, and both times that I have, the main course has come out before I've finished my appetizer. Ultimately, I like what they do here. I think they have some areas of opportunity, but they've got the big things right. A little more attention to detail, and management that spends more time managing the staff and less time bussing tables and running food will go a long way to helping Mafioza's. From a profitability standpoint they could even move away from some of their amazing deals. From a consumer standpoint, I hope they keep them. In short, you can do a lot worse than Mafioza's.

We arrived around 7:30 on a Sunday night and the place was packed - we got ourselves put on the list for a table, grabbed a few drinks at the bar (two-for-one pints on Sundays) and staked out a spot by the wall to wait. Once we were seated we had a great view into the kitchen, where one chef was tossing pizza dough impressively. Sadly they were out of The Upside - an upside-down carpaccio dish (or as I called it, \"Meat salad!\") by the time we got around to ordering. Since we'd gone for appetizers at City House we split a Caponata salad and a DeMartino pizza. Our food came out fairly quickly, although we spent some time admiring the salad while we tried to flag down our server for cutlery. We had the salad first and then the pizza and it was timed well so we weren't waiting too long between the courses.

It's the only place in the 12 South area that is open late. The Tap Room stays open until midnight, most of the other nearby establishments only stay open till 10. Mafiaoza's is open until 3am, an enticing prospect when you are heading home after a night of libations. They also have 2-4-1 drinks on Sundays and Tuesdays, with 2-4-1 pizza slices on Tuesdays as well. But enough about the alcohol et al, on to the food.Their hot wings are not bad, they have a good crisp to them and you get a fair amount per order. They have been the most consistent appetizer in my experiences.Vinny's Maccheroni was not a good experience for me. It is described as baked mac & cheese that is then fried and served with a vodka cream sauce. I have tried them 3 times, and what I always received were blocks of burnt macaroni with a touch of cheese. Not appetizing.Their fried ravioli sticks are better, but they too suffer from overcooking on occasion, and they also tend to get over-salted.Of the salads, I have only tried the Caponata and the Caprese. The caponata is a nice mix of vegetables served with a balsamic vinegar dressing. My only knocks against the Caponata is that sometimes you get too little eggplant compared to everything else, and the balsamic dressing is too vinegary. The Caprese is slightly different from its traditional construction in that the tomato and mozzarella are served on a large bed of mixed greens. I personally would prefer less greens, but I don't think it's a negative per se. However, basil can be sparse and it is the same vinegary balsamic dressing that you find on the Caponata.Many people love the pizza at this place: they have a wide selection of specialty pies that can be ordered whole or by the slice. You can also make your own slice/pizza with any toppings you desire. I, however, have found the pizza to be a bit lacking. The slices, while ample, are lacking in sauce and covered in cheese that does more to detract from the experience than augment it. To me, a good slice of pizza uses the cheese to hold everything together and accentuate the toppings, not overwhelm everything.Their pasta dishes are my favorites, and the only ones in the bunch that I would suggest. I have tried the Davinci, the Mark, the Cugine, and the Joey. All were good; plentiful toppings, good sauce, good flavor. I recommend the Joey if you like things a little spicy.Ok, to wrap this thing up: the salads aren't bad, the pastas are decent. Everything else can be hit or miss.

Well, can you not ticket him for that?\" I asked.\"We can't do anything about it.,\" I could tell he was ashamed, \"He's the owner.\"My jaw hung open as the officer explained to me that since the restaurant was private property, a sign should be posted denoting any penalty for parking there [in addition to the space being painted; he had not posted a sign]. Beyond that, the decision is made to ticket or not ticket the person who parks there illegally; that decision is the prerogative of-wait for it-the owner.Just so it sinks in for the folks at home: the owner of the restaurant routinely parks in the only space marked for use by people with disabilities on the entire property, knowing he can do so without any consequences, by virtue of his ownership.

Overall, the kitchen had no reason to rush or careless in haste of making pizza for a full restaurant. The waiter explained how to order telling me that you can get anything by the slice: build your own or a slice of one of the specialty pizzas. He warned, however, that the slice price is based on the amount of toppings and that some of the specialty pizza slices can be pricey. No worries! It's 2 for Tuesday!I ordered an Informant (roasted veggie pizza) and a Dolan (BBQ chicken pizza). When they make slices, they have pre-cut slices of dough with a little sauce on it as a base so that they can make any kind of pizza slice you could order. Paying by the topping is fine and dandy, that's how most places work. However, I expect a reasonable amount of toppings if I am paying extra to have something other than your average pepperoni pizza. I got my order and each slice was severely lacking in the toppings area. They may as well have been slices of cheese pizza (definitely overloaded on the cheese). I feel cheated.

We came at 3 and parking was not a problem but I could see how that might get difficult but even that struggle would be totally worth it. I was excited about their draft beer selection, especially the fact that they had Angry Orchard on tap. This was starting off very well. Our server, Scotty was very friendly and extremely knowledgable. He pointed out the new local brews on the menu and once we told him it was our first time there, he walked us through each section on the menu. When servers do that it's pretty easy to tell if they know the product well and it was obvious Scotty could talk intelligently about all parts of the menu. We were impressed. They were doing a special that if you ordered their piccola (cheese and meat trays), the chef would throw in a few extra items free. What a great deal. We got a pick five and got three special items on the board. Scotty did a great job recommending selections. Everything on our board was delicious but I especially enjoyed the goat cheese with honey and peppers, I probably could have had a tub of that and some crostini and been satisfied with that. The timing was perfect as we were just finishing up our appetizer as our pizza came. We ordered the Fall Guy with meatballs and sausage and it was very tasty. One of the things I crave when I go back to Philly is something other than chain pizza.

I came in around 5. All I wanted was a tasty slice of pizza before checking into my B&B. Is that so much to ask?! I sat at the bar to watch the World Cup. The bartender got his job done, but wasn't especially friendly like you'd want a bartender to be. I asked if I could get a side salad, but was only able to get a small. I figured I'd box it up for lunch tomorrow. No... it came out a big pile of limp iceberg lettuce with three sad slices of tomato and cucumber. Ordered one pizza slice with sausage, mushrooms, and olives. While the crust was good, there was maybe a spoonful of sausage on the whole piece, virtually no tomato sauce, and such a dump of melted mozzarella on top that I had to scrape it off. I noted to the bartender that there was basically no sausage on my pizza, and he offered to get me a new one. As I waited a couple waitresses were filling drinks next to me bitching about an earlier unsatisfied customer. Second slice came up, literally domed with sausage crumbles and cheese. It almost felt like the kitchen was intentionally trying to be rude. I took a few bites and asked for the check. $12 for a small salad and a slice of pizza would be kind of ridiculous to begin with, even if it was enjoyable!

But the server never stopped walking... you had to talk to him as we rushed by \u00a0your table. He missed several requests our table of four had and didn't seem to care. We ate early last night (a Saturday) and still had poor service. Our server approached us, smelling like cigarettes, and with a trainee. We assume a trainee... because our server never mentioned the guy or why he was following him around. Very strange. Our pizza took nearly 28 minutes to arrive and our server never stopped by to check in on us or check the kitchen to see where our pizza was. Someone else delivered our pizza to us.

I'm giving it 3 stars even though I give Opry Mills and Mallory Lane 4 stars...and it's for 2 reasons.First of all - I don't understand why they can't get their fajita steak consistent with the other Nashville locations. If you go to Mallory Lane or Opry Mills the steak on the fajita skillet AND the quesdilla is super tender with a nice flavor, lime overtones. But Midtown's always comes out tougher than the other locations. I was talking to someone in management at the Mallory Springs location and they were talking about how they're always spending time with the Midtown kitchen trying to \"train them up\" but it just doesn't seem to pan out. Might want to check the equipment at some point.Second - the parking is an absolute nightmare. This isn't all Chuy's fault but I'm dinging them for not thinking ahead. I don't understand why the local valet parking company sends all their punks to his location but be warned - - give your car a once over before you hand the keys off to these idiots. I give it a 50/50 chance the car comes back with a brand new ding, scratch or dent. It's so bad - you really should carry a flashlight and do a walkaround check of the car before you give the driver a tip. And if you come at a slow time and park yourself - be warned - the parking valet company will block you in if you park in \"their spot\".The only reason I don't give this location 2 stars is 1) the management is very cordial, \u00a02) they can still do a macho burrito on Saturday/Sunday that compares to the other locations. If you want to learn more about the macho burrito read my review on the Mallory Lane location for Chuy's, and 3) They love my kids even though they trash the place.If you're headed to downtown Nashville for any reason - this is a good place to stop if you're jonesing for Tex-Mex and don't want to deal with the Vandy students at SATCO (San Antonio Taco Company) on 21st Avenue.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 12 reviews", "date": "2014-02-23"}, {"rating": "2.0", "name": "\nSarah S.\n", "review": "Noooo.

So we had some food here and also a drink. But to start us off, we were brought chips and salsa as is customary in most mexican restaurants. The salsa itself, compared to your standard mexican place that I've been to around Nashville. It definitely had a very good consistency and felt very fresh and delicious - my only complaint would be that it may have had a bit too much lime.For drinks, I ordered a sangria, while my friend ordered a mango frozen margarita. My sangria was pretty filled with flavor, and had a very decent bit of alcohol in it. Nothing crazy strong, but a good average amount. However, my friend had a different experience with her drink - she said that while it was tasty, it felt like it had no alcohol in it at all. I tried hers and she tried mine, and she agreed that mine was great and with enough kick to it, but I noticed that hers was indeed pretty soft on the kick.Another little small plus would be that the waiter gave us a bit of the jalape\u00f1o dipping sauce for us to try with our chips, free of charge. It was pretty delicious, but I didn't have too much since it was more mayo based and that doesn't go so well with chips or the food I got.For food, I got a ground sirloin beef set of 2 tacos. I really expected a small plate, but I should have just got a soup - it was a TON of food! The two taco tortillas were average sized, but had good bit of filling, and i had lettuce, guacamole, re-fried beans, rice, and diced tomatoes. The ground beef itself though was kind of bland in my opinion. I should have got the chicken, which seemed to have more flavor from the bit I tried.Overall, not a bad place, but pretty average.

My friends and I were enjoying lively libations across the street at Tavern when we started to feel the urge for some chips and salsa and maybe a margarita to add to our portfolio of cocktails for the evening. I should preface that I previously had never stepped foot into a Chuy's nor did I realize that it was a chain. I swear. If I would have know the odd events that were to occur, I would have happily stayed at Tavern and ordered up some bites there. From an aesthetic viewpoint, I actually think the \"Griswoldy\" light arrangement on the exterior is fun and adds a kitschy element to the neighborhood. The deck seating appeared to be spacious and will likely be a popular hangout in favorable weather. Once we stepped inside, I was surprised by how spacious Chuy's was. It certainly gave off a more \"corporate\" vibe that reminded me of TGI - Friday's, flair and all. Our server seemed very inexperienced in not only the menu offerings but also the drink menu. See Annelise N's review for the complete scoop what is now referred to as \"Jack Daniel's-gate\" within our inner circle. I seriously thought that were on a hidden camera show when she brought out her special version of Jack and water. WOW. I ordered the tasty Veggie Enchiladas ($7.99) which was comprised of onions, zucchini, yellow squash, red bell peppers, serranos, spinach, roasted green chiles, and corn in homemade tortillas with Ranchero sauce. I excluded the cheese as I am a vegan. The entree also came with beans and rice which is a fair price for such a filling meal. However, again the waitress was very erratic in her behavior when I was ordering and had difficulty answering questions on their veg-friendly options. This is even more strange because little symbols with \"anti-cows\" are featured throughout the menu to denote veg-friendly fare.I also ordered up a strawberry margarita ($5.99) which was totally forgettable. The other annoying factor was we had to repeatedly ask the server for more salsa which she kept forgetting. I would normally not ding a business so hard due to a server's inadequacies but this experience was so odd and truly affected our overall satisfaction repeatedly throughout our visit.

I saw the chunks of tomatoes, but they weren't freshly cut. I couldn't tell if it was a salsa cruda or a flash-cooked salsa.I tried the Southwestern, based on another review that said to try this dish with the fried egg on top. And I like to try unusual combinations and I love huevos rancheros. Unfortunately, this dish wasn't up to my expectations. I stupidly ordered too quickly and forgot to specify my usual \"no beans, extra rice\". So, while I barely ate the tortilla and egg, the chicken was left alone. I ate up all the rice, but the refried beans were not touched (I don't think I was asked which kind I wanted, if there were a choice). And I don't know why a \"salad\" is included if it's barely more than just a garnish. It did contain a few jalapenos.The sweet tea is fruity and I detected the noticeable \"crunch\" of undissolved sugar crystals when I stirred it with my straw. Not ordering that again. I prefer my sweet tea made from a simple syrup. Otherwise, it's just an iced tea with sugar added.The flan was very rich -- just the way I liked it.

Worst dining experience in my lifetime. I had high expectations because I have been to the one in Cool Springs and enjoyed myself. I went in on a Saturday for lunch, and it was early. 1115ish. My wife and I sat at the bar for some quick service because she had to be somewhere at 12. This is when the madness began. For starters, the bartender was rude. We had to flag him down to get refills because he was at the end of the bar talking to one of the servers. The bartender's conversation with the server was UNREAL. They were complaining very loudly about management, scheduling, the people they worked with, etc. I left feeling like I knew every problem going on in the restaurant. A server then came up to the bartender and asked if they were still serving mojitos, because he couldnt find the button on the computer to order it. The bartender said, and I quote, \"yeah, I *can* make it, but don't start ordering that bullshit this early in the day. I don't want to mess with that bullshit. Tell them to get something else.\"I was appalled. The bartender was not only inconsiderate, inattentive and rude, but he told his server to lie to paying patrons because he was too lazy to do his job. There was a nice server who we asked to check on our food, and he brought it out immediately, and it was lukewarm. Clearly had been sitting there for a few minutes. When we needed our check, we had to flag down the same server to get it from the bartender, and also asked the guy for a box for to go. I wouldn't go back here if they offered to buy me and 20 of my closest friends dinner and drinks. I have never seen incompetence on this level at any restaurant in my 30 years on this earth. Just pathetic. Look, I worked in restaurants for years in high school and through college. I know it can suck, but the people who pay your bills do not want to hear you bitching about management.

I will try and keep my reviews in perspective, because lets be honest, this place would never survive in a more foodie city.I have eaten at Chuy's 2 times already. First time, I had a steak burrito with a couple of sides. It was a wet burrito and filled with nothing but steak. Though I usually appreciate some accompaniments in my burritos, the steak was fantastic! Amazingly tender and had great flavor on its own. The sauce was also quite amazing. A bit on the spicier side, but I really enjoy that. So those of a more sensitive pallet, be careful, because everything I tried was on the spicier side. The chips are quite fantastically crispy without being greedy or too thick. As for the sides, I really enjoyed both the beans and fried rice. Though its hard to mess up refried beans, the seasoning was really great and the rice was not mushy, which I personally hate!Second visit, not so great. Sat on the patio this time, which is quite nice since I have not seen too many restaurants in Nashville with a patio, but the Mexican-Cobb salad was offensively bad. Fist of all, if I order an entree salad, I do not want a fricking side or ranch, it is suppose to be a prepared dish! Secondly, the green chilies and tomatoes were taste less, the lettuce seemed like some flavorless cross of Romain and iceberg. Redeeming quality, the fajita chicken on the salad was actually pretty good for cold chicken. So after that slight thrashing, I would say go eat there for sure, especially if you are planning on going out in Mid Town. The service was actually pretty good and the atmosphere relaxed.

My sister got a chicken one and when it got there we could barely find any chicken in it and the server just told her she needed to dig for it but he was sure it was in there. My step dad also go the chicken chili relleno and when he cut into it it was shrimp! The server took that one back and replaced it with a chicken one. Another thing I found extremely annoying was I started to get a stomach ache most likely from the poor quality of food the serve at chuy's and asked for a soda water and bitters. The server first of all had no idea what angastora bitters was then returned to the table and said they didn't have any behind the bar. I was shocked to learn that a place that claims to have a \"full bar\" doesn't have any bitters but whatever!Anyway, Chuy's wasn't the worst tex mex I have ever had but I do believe that there are many other quality mexican places to eat at in Nashville and I won't waste my time or money at Chuy's again!", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 22 reviews", "date": "2012-06-15"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nStefanie P.\n", "review": "It's a chain, its near a college campus and its the only sorta cool chain place in the area.

The re-fried beans had the welcomed textural addition of whole pintos mixed in.

This is something that I have only ever experienced in Austin, so I was very excited to see it on the menu at Chuy's.For dinner I ordered that burrito. It is HUGE! As big as your head huge! Its filled with a meat of your choosing, beans, cheese and covered with that creamy jalapeno sauce. It come with a side of rice, which almost seems unnecessary noting the size of the burrito.

However, when the food came, the entire selection of flautas, tacos, and enchiladas that was on our plate can all be summed up with the same word: BLAND. No element of this sampler was even REMOTELY spicy or flavorful, and the chicken taco just tasted like someone cooked a plain chicken breast, shredded it, and then stuffed in a taco shell with some iceberg lettuce. I will say, however, that the chips were pretty addicting. They were the super thin and salty kind that you could eat a million of. The salsa was very fresh and had a nice kick. The \"creamy jalapeno\" sauce was good, but again, no jalapeno flavor to speak of whatsoever...it just basically tasted like ranch, which is unexciting but universally appealing.

When they opened this latest location in midtown Nashville, we decided to give it a try, not expecting that much. What a pleasant surprise! Good food, fast and friendly service, and it brought back a lot of good food memories from Texas. I think it's important to note that this is TexMex, not Mexican - this might seem like a subtle distinction, but it's really a huge difference in practice. What we ate: vegetarian combo (a cheese relleno + veggie enchilada), chips & salsa, bean & cheese burrito, sopapillas.Pros:*SUPER TASTY chips and salsa with some zing to the salsa and nice warm chips (free, BTW)*Friendly and efficient waitstaff*The best vegetable enchilada I've probably ever had*Tasty rice & beans*Authentic TexMexCons: *The sopapillas were pretty \"eh\"*Portion sizes were too large (but I get the sense this is something they are known for? And also something most people don't mind)*I can see parking being a total nightmare on busy nights. We went at lunch and didn't have a problem getting a spot but this was already a tough area of town to find parking spots on Friday/Saturday nights. Kid-friendly scale:We didn't have our toddler along, but I think this is a totally kid-friendly restaurant. There were several babies and young kids there at lunch and they seemed to be having a fine time. Vegetarian-friendly scale:Two thumbs up, really. I normally hate veggie enchiladas, something about the flavors and the nasty overcooked veggies in them. I took a gamble here and I'm glad I did - really tasty, big chunks of fresh vegetables. My husband had the bean burrito and loved it as well. There aren't a ton of vegetarian options on their menu, but I was really happy with the ones that were available. Other notes: We didn't have a margarita as it was midday on a work day. I'm looking forward to coming here in the evening to have the chance to see what they're making.

I love spicy food as much as the next person with singed tastebuds, but everything - from the salsa to the rice - was overwhelmingly hot in comparison to the other spots.

So, from pints to snifters to tulips to... sippy cups... you're guaranteed to get a beer poured the way it should be and in the manner in which it should be experienced. That's quite the boon for an unassuming Elliston Place bar. The taps are impressive -- both from a variety standpoint and a numbers game. Beer snobs, you have found your place. Experiencing Black Abbey's Crossroads for the first time in the proper glassware was a real treat. If you're not a beer snob, however, Hurry Back is accessible enough to walk you through your taste profile and, perhaps, introduce you to a new favorite.* So, as a beer bar, Hurry Back is the bee's knees.Where Hurry Back falters a bit is in food and seasonality. Food is an afterthought here. That's not necessarily a bad thing. The focus here is on beer and that's why you should come. The fact that there's food at all, actually, is a good plus. But the food offered is a variance on drunk frat grub. On one hand, it's pretty cool that they've come up with a menu that so accurately hits that ultra-specific niche. The bad part... well, you were in college. You remember. This leads to the second (slight) ding: seasonality. This is a bar that works best in warmer weather. The bar space is pretty tight so the cool patio (to the side) is a needed element for optimal enjoyment. Plus, if you're eating a hot dog or a sandwich with Doritos\u2122 on it, doing so on a patio with a beer in hand just seems like the right place at the right time. Plus, there are board games, big tvs and hockey... so it's like you're in a fraternity house at Beer U. That's cool -- especially for warm weather. Taking away the outdoor/space elements, HB can flash you back to crowded, small keggers... and that's not fair to the inventory and/or vibe to the space. So, what's the answer? I dunno. Luckily, Nashville only gets about 2-3 months of *cold* cold weather. So, if you can bear the crowds or you're that guy/girl who wears shorts all year long and can hang out outside, go for it. Otherwise, I'll see you come summer.*Just, please... leave the hops alone.

In December 2014, I came down for the Paper Route show at Exit/In, and due to not wanting to stay in line in freezing cold weather, wanted somewhere to hang out for a bit. Came in to Hurry Back, and was very impressed. Was immediately greeted, and served relatively quickly, and was very impressed. Even had a plate of hummus and chips, which albeit it being bar food was fairly good. At the time would've given a 4 or 5 star rating.So, this comes to Tuesday June 16 2015. Came down to Exit In for the Mae 10th anniversary Everglow show, and again not wanting to stand in line for close to an hour before doors opened, wandered into Hurry Back for a little pregaming, aka not wanting to pay five or six dollars for a Coors Light next door. Walked inside, was relatively busy, but even so, it was no busier than my last trip. Sat down at the bar, and a bartender walked by, maybe nodding or smiling, but in no other way acknowledging me. At least two other bartenders walked by, and said nothing to me, nor acknowledged my presence. I waited at least 5 minutes, without any acknowledgement from anyone or any offer of anything at all.

But I believe this place is on an upward slide, so Caesar will be generous on this day.I have friends who come here for hotdogs at lunch or happy hour and they said it's the sort of place I would really enjoy. In many ways, they were right about my likes. There is a fine collection of board games, tons of places to sit inside and on the patio to drink and laugh and play said-boardgames, a Predators themed hockey game, and most importantly, dozens of great beers on tap. I was there on a Sunday, so they also had the Titans game on a handful of appropriately sized televisions and a projector that I would bet plays old and/or weird movies at night. Since I was there on a Sunday for football, a few of the taps had been tapped during the debauched Friday and Saturday evening by music fans stumbling out of the Elliston Place concerts. But it wasn't too many.What really sets the Hurry Back apart from other Midtown mainstays like the Brewhouse or Tavern are two things. 1) It has a wide beer selection that includes both locals and Belgians (and emphasizes beer cocktails, an underrated form of drink) and 2) It's super laid back. Just in case the board games didn't give that away.I had myself the Delerium Kriek (They call it the Red), the sort of thing that partying Belgians drink in Brussels. It was tasty and refreshing. Then I switched to the Yazoo seasonal. Both on tap and both wonderful. They also had meads, wines, and a great selection of beer bottles. Tim, the bartender and server, took good care of us even when the ladies in my party teased him.Their main entres are hot dogs, which are actually sausages from the Porter Road Butcher (see my review of their establishment for the wonder this brings me). I had the chorizo, and it was great.If I had a complaint about the place, it's the expense. I could see it being okay during happy hour or for the Midtown crowd, but I'm not sure I'd make it my local and drink here every day. The location is amazing though, walkable or bikable from music row to Fisk.I don't think I'll Hurry Back, but I think the name's a bit ironic anyway, so that's cool.

On Wednesdays, beers (both bottle and draft under $5 are 2 for 1) and well drinks are double pours. This is only a Nashville thing..but the token system is awesome. For those unfamiliar... if you buy something that is 2 for 1, you can get a token to bring back another time (even when its not happy hour) to get your free drink. AND the tokens work at both locations (PLEASE NOTE THERE ARE TWO so your friends don't meet you at the wrong place)!So the system for getting a table is not the best here. You essentially will have to wait out another table (as in uncomfortably standing near them so that you can lay claim to their table as soon as they leave). I am hoping this is not generally the case...but certainly for craft beer week and a championship game...I waited for ~30+ minutes for a table. However, the table was outside on the patio and was perfect. The ML Rose west location has a great outdoor section that includes fold out chairs and corn hole. So if you don't get a table.. you can lounge around outside and just get beers at the bar. Its much faster that way anyway. Our server was very nice but you can tell he was overwhelmed. I don't blame him, it was very busy and he was as sweet as ever.Food: We only ordered appetizers but the loaded waffle fries were good but nothing special. There wasn't much cheese and an overwhelmingly large scoop of sour cream. However, you really can't go wrong with waffle fries. Cost-- $7.95. The serving wasn't particularly generous either. I really want to try their burgers next time. Of note... Mondays are BOGO burgers and Trivia night!Beers: Such a great draft collection. The brought out a whole list of summer beers and the menu is segmented perfectly to cater to tastes (smooth, extra hoppy, etc). I had the calfkiller... a brew made in small batches \u00a0somewhere in TN. It looked very much so like a chocolate stout..but did not taste quite so. I really liked it! However... the definite winner that night were the Mayday brews.The Mayday blonde is fantastic! They also had Yazoo's 10 yr IPA (celebration) on tap that I will have to try with my token. Its a white IPA... which I am not familiar with at all.I will definitely be back- most likely this Saturday as they are hosting a Oskar Blues Brunch pairing that Blew my mind. They have a TenFidy bacon. Y'all.. if you have never had Oskar Blues TenFidy beer .. you need to. It will make you more of a man. (TenFidy refers to the percent alcohol of the beer). The brunch is $20 an a STEAL for that price. A normal can of TenFidy at a bar sets you back at least 10 bucks. But... yeah... maybe y'all shouldn't go.

I love good burgers- especially places that source local ingredients and beers. First the good- the beer selection is superb. They have numerous drafts, cans and bottles predominately from local breweries. A great mix of different options. We started with a brisket quesadilla. It was full of cheese, pretty thick and griddled on the outside. Problems- it has bacon on the inside. Some may think this isn't a problem, but for my husband who doesn't eat Pork- they really need to mention it on the menu. Second- for $10 it's a little on the expensive side. I don't mind paying $10 for an appetizer at all, but when there is only a few extremely small pieces of brisket on the inside seems over priced. The burgers - are just ok. I ordered the Nite Owl - but it wasn't as good as I was hoping. The stout onions sound great, but you don't even taste them nor did I really even see them. Kenny's cheddar is always good and the bacon was \u00a0great too- but just seemed like a plain cheese burger without any sauces or church. Waffle fries were just ok. Honeslty- burger up is hands down better and they have messed up my temp of the burger several times. Anyways- my husband got the brunch steak and eggs- and man did I feel bad for him. It was literally served in a gravy bowl- super small. No temp on the steak because it's shredded (!?!?). He put on salt, pepper and ketchup only to be still disappointed by the overlooked eggs and steak. He ended up ordering a burger for himself after that.

My husband and I have tried almost every new burger (we haven't tried the turkey burger because neither of us are into that sort of thing). The Nashvegas (pimiento cheese, tobacco onions, and bbq sauce on a sweet potato bun) and the Nite Owl (tomato jam, braised onions, bacon, and cheddar) are like small slices of heaven on buns (yeah, I went there).

If you're not in to bigger crowds, avoid the 2-4-1 nights where it tends to get a little crowded. Also, I've never witnessed a rowdy crowd here.Pretty People Watching: Yep I said it.

Happy hour M-F which includes $1 off liquor, wine, beers and apps. You can see all the specifics here.Beer/Drinks: Fabulous craft beer selection that rotates seasonally, and they offer one of the best drinks in town: the Bushwacker, basically a Wendy's frosty for adults. Good Service/Food: The burgers are fab, and I love the nachos and BBQ wings too (BBQ wings are no longer on the menu, but you can still get them).

They give spicy pickles to put on your sandwich. Yum! And their BBQ sauce is a little tangy, a little spicy and a little sweet. Just awesome! I know everyone raves about their cheese biscuits. We don't particularly care for them. They are like super sweet corn bread muffins with cheddar cheese in them.

I overheard him complaining to a co-worker that other waiters had been stealing orders to improve their service. After the third time he said he would check on it he came back with the bread, but they forgot the butter dish. Whatever, the food came shortly after. My pulled chicken sandwich had pickles on it, which was a bit surprising because it didn't say there would be pickles on it anywhere on the menu and I absolutely hate pickles. I told them I wasn't expecting pickles and they said they would fix it. It comes back 10 seconds later, clearly they just pulled off the pickles and sent it back. Anyone that hates pickles knows this doesn't change anything, the juice has already flavored the sandwich with an overwhelming pickle taste. My first bite confirmed this. I didn't eat any more of it, the waiter never asked if there was anything wrong with it and I ended up paying $10 (after tax) for a sandwich I took one bite out of.My girlfriend said her pulled pork sandwich was very dry and she barely ate half of it.

The fries are awesome. So fresh and tasty. The cole slaw isn't as sweet as some places it has a hint of vinegar and lots of green onions in it. Yum.

It's family friendly, but also has a sizable bar area, as well.I recommend the pulled pork (ask for them to include a little \"outside meat\" -- the charred, burned part -- to give yourself a pit-cooked experience). However, the chicken and ribs are great, as well. Biggest surprise is the beef brisket which, while it wouldn't please a someone raised in Texas, is a pretty good imitation of what they call barbecue down there.The collards are good and they have them on the menu all the time.

My original destination was supposed to be Martin's (located in nowheresville Tennessee -- Nolensville, which is approx 30 minutes from downtown Nashville), which is supposed to be the best in all of Tennessee. After driving all that way though, I found out it was closed for renovation. The unfortunate thing was that there was no notice, no message, no sign, no nothing of the news. Apparently that's common for some of these rib places in Tennessee. =/ For that reason, and after some research, I figured I'd give one of the next best a try... which brought me to Jim & Nick's. =)Next off... being from New York, I don't know how viable my review is. Because I was so in love with the food after having it though, I felt that a review was absolutely necessary!! For those that are like me though (a person whose never really had real BBQ), this place is as good as it freakin gets. From the first bite to the last, I swear I just stepped into heaven for a brief moment of time. It was simply and absolutely stupifyingly amazing!!! If you can make a trip here, I say with full force, YOU MUST GO!!! As for the details....1) Wine that I ordered was pretty damn good, especially for the low price of $3! They were running some drink specials the night I was there so I figured I'd give it a whirl. I normally would've ordered a drink drink, but since I knew I'd have wine later, I figured I'd just stick with that. 2) THEY WERE INSANELY QUICK! And when I say quick, I mean I blinked my eyes and the food was there. As I said, since I'm not from the south (likewise with the boyfriend), we had no idea what to order so we took a while to decide. Once we did, he left for the bathroom, forking aside the ordering responsibility. As soon as he left, the waitress came and took our order. After that, I took a sip of my wine, finished the 2nd bite of my cheesy bread and BOOM! The food was at our table! The boyfriend didn't even return from the bathroom before it came. That's how quick it was!!3) The food was AMAZING!!!! I had the baby back ribs, cinnamon apples and baked beans. He had the smoked chicken. The first... I think I drooled all the way to the very last morsel. Even my boyfriend who doesn't care much for meat in general, let alone ribs was in love with it! The chicken.... well it was chicken. Nothing really to write home about.4) Don't know about other nights, but on the Thursday night that I went, it wasn't too crazy, loud or messy. Even though the place looked like a fast food joint/applebee's type chain, it was really clean and nice. The restaurant even had a drive-thru, which I personally found to be somewhat funny. 5) The prices were very reasonable. If you get one of the combo meals and share it, you can actually be comfortably full, and at the low price of $15.99. If, on the other hand, you feel that you can eat a whole ship, well then you definitely need to get an entire plate for yourself.", "location": "\nNew York, NY\n", "exp": " 150 reviews", "date": "2010-02-27"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nChristopher F.\n", "review": "Very good BBQ one of the best I have ever had. \u00a0This restaurant particularly specializes in Pork and various sausages. \u00a0I would recommend trying the sampler, I had the pulled pork, the red hot sausage, my wife had the ribs, the beef brisket, and pulled pork. \u00a0Everything was amazing the sides are just as good the Mac N cheese is real good and the collard greens good as well. \u00a0The wait staff is some of the most courteous and professional I have ever come across. \u00a0In addition, they gave us a free basket of onion rings not sure why but was not complaining. \u00a0Prices are decent if you are on tight budget the sandwiches offer an excellent value.", "location": "\nAnn Arbor, MI\n", "exp": " 264 reviews", "date": "2010-01-13"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nadrian E.\n", "review": "I had a surprise here!?!

The prices are great here, you can eat pretty inexpensively or go all out, depending on your mood and budget. \u00a0The portions are also pretty on par, almost everything you order comes with your choice of at least two sides. \u00a0You end up with the perfect amount of food, enough to make you satisfied but not so much that you're tempted to stuff yourself to finish all the deliciousness. \u00a0Really my only complaint besides the distant location, is how busy this place can get. \u00a0I definitely recommend going on a weeknight or off hour, otherwise y", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 170 reviews", "date": "2009-01-20"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nHeather R.\n", "review": "I'm a born and bred southerner whether I lay claim at all times or not, so I'm pretty particular about my Q.

The stretch of street the coffee shop is on is quaint, attractive and gets you in the mood for what you're about the discover. RB is a coffee shop for all seasons and occasions. In fact, it's a bit short-sighted of me to call it a coffee shop.

The wifi is strong and the light is good. These are all important qualities for a good work space. But what of the java, man? It's... delightful. While the standard coffee drinks are potent, strong and enjoyable, the proof in the pudding is in the seasonal offerings. The standards will always be there. In my estimation, always get the special stuff while the getting is good. In my case, the good getting came in the form of the La Petite Fleur latte. This autumn seasonal was a light, creamy blend of lavender, clove & mint. Do you understand why I used the word 'delightful'? From the first sip, I was a fan.

I wouldn't come if you are short on time or starving by the time you arrive.As for the coffee, it is good. They pride themselves on organic and fair trade teas and coffee. This is one of the main reasons I frequent here for my caffeine addiction. But, if you are going to go with organic, please make your milk and syrups (and whatever else you may pair with your coffee or espresso) organic.

Tenn Sixteen is a perfectly serviceable neighborhood restaurant. While one might not drive from, say, Sylvan Park to come here, denizens from Edgefield, Maxwell Park, East End, Lockeland Springs, and the like would/should surely come here for some beer, bites and a relaxed environment.I don't know if this is an everyday thing or just a Sunday thing, but I was mighty pleased to discover a two for one deal going on. I helped myself to two Jackalopes (poured in the proper glass). Had i been there to watch the game (or, TV in general; there wasn't much discrimination when it came to what was on the tube), I would have been more than satisfied to sit at the bar, drink some beer and TV/people watch. But, I'm a fatty... and fatties eat.Yes, the NOLA things is a bit confusing... but go with it. How many NOLA-inspired eateries are in this part of town? In any case, I think the menu is more Southern-inspired with NOLA accents than straight up etouffee, po' boys and the like (which you can order here). I started with a cup of gumbo and, immediately, wished I'd ordered a bowl. The roux was thick, the spices were humming and the ingredients with thick, chunky and plentiful. It paired very nicely with my beer. I couldn't decide on what I wanted for my main course. I don't think I chose as strongly as I could have... but I, nevertheless, enjoyed what I got. I ordered the bbq chicken (see? Southern) with the gouda mac & cheese and red cabbage slaw. As I am want to do, I mixed everything together. The bbq sauce added a nice sweet and subtly spicy kick to the meat -- which was a big hunk of white meat. This was anemic piece of chicken. I ate the fowl atop the cabbage which was a good idea. Not only did the slaw add texture but chicken, bbq sauce and slaw (especially being so close to Memphis) is always a good idea. The mac & cheese was ok; I wanted it to be better. I have a slab of smoked gouda in my refrigerator right now. I'm pretty mad about the stuff. The pasta dish could have had much deeper flavor and thicker consistency. As it was, the cheese was a bit bland and runny which is too bad considering the potential.

Despite the name of the restaurant being an abbreviation for Tennessee and the logo being an outline of our fair state, the theme inside is apparently New Orleans Mardi Gras. WHAT?! This is the most confused theme I have ever seen. I guess to drive home the Mardi Gras vibe they painted the walls a variety of yellows, purples and greens while hanging the most hideous plastic bead lighting fixtures I've ever seen. Add to this a dizzying array of flat screen TVs and some really terrible paintings you have a big mish-mosh of decor. I think the whole thing would be better if they created a theme around the name- a very TN-focused vibe, or change the name and go full-on Louisiana.Since it was Sunday Funday we decided to have a few adult beverages with our meal. The beer selection on tap was quite impressive as well as their bottle list. Unfortunately, they didn't have in stock everything that was listed on the menu. Twice Steve ordered a beer and twice our waitress came back to tell him that they were out of it. Super disappointing to Steve. He did finally wind up with one of our favorites, the chocolate stout from Fort Collins Brewery.I went with the perennial morning favorite, the Bloody Mary. Tenn 16 made a solid one and I'm always a fan when it's garnished with pickled okra.For my entree I chose the three egg omelet with veggies and cheese with a side of cheesy home fries. This omelet was inedible and I pretty much just picked out the vegetables and pushed the eggs to the side of the plate. Why? They cooked the omelet in a pan that was way too small for the amount of eggs and fillings, creating a small tough block of eggs that were terribly overcooked and stiff. Omelets should be light and fluffy and allow you to taste the joy of eggs (eggs are WONDERFUL). This omelet was more like a brick and less like a food product. The cheesy home fries were pretty awesome though. We all had them as sides for our entrees and agreed that these were our favorite part.Steve ordered the crab benedict and once again Tenn 16 proved that they cannot cook an egg. Poached eggs that are traditionally served on a benedict are lightly cooked so that when you first put your fork to the egg the yolk gently pours out covering everything in golden deliciousness. Tenn 16's eggs were overcooked such that the yolk was mostly solid and nothing was runny.The service wasn't very good either. Our waitress was forgetful and didn't stop at our table nearly enough. After we were done eating, she would stop by our table and ask if we needed anything else, and then leave without taking away the dirty plates. She did this twice before I told her explicitly that we were done and the plates could be taken away. Granted, my plate still had the stiff overcooked remnants of my omelet, but Steve and our friend had mostly cleared their plates. Tenn 16 was busy at this point, but they appeared to have enough staff working that the service should have been better.Overall, I would say skip Tenn 16 for brunch. There are tons of places nearby that serve a solid brunch (Marche, Mad Donna's) that are definitely worth the wait.

Good spot to watch NFL Sunday Ticket:My wife and I would come here during the football season to catch the Pats games. Its a good spot for Sunday ticket: not too crowded, have 8 TVs, so if you get there early you can usually pick your game before they set up the spots, and they have a terrific beer selection with 2-1 on Sundays during the games. The downside (for Sundays) is that you can really only see 4 games on either side of the bar, so if one of the games you are interested happens to be on the other side, you are out of luck. Also, they only serve brunch on Sundays until 3:00pm, so even if you want something a bit more substantial (to pair with a beer during the game perhaps) you are left with mostly breakfast options until the second game. Their brunch is actually fantastic (bananas foster french toast and chicken & waffles are both great), I'm just usually not in a brunch mood during a football game. Good spot for dinner:We have now gone to Tenn Sixteen for dinner twice, and both times we were very impressed with the experience, from the food to the service. The ambiance is fantastic on a nice cool evening when they open up the large windows to the street. The food is a nice blend of southern comfort food with some new orleans style creole options. The fried green tomatoes are an outstanding appetizer. My wife's favorite menu item was the shrimp and grits, which are creamy with plenty of cheese and just a little bit of spice. I found what might be my favorite sandwich in Nashville: the meatloaf sandwich. My expectations weren't that high, I like meatloaf, but it certainly isn't my favorite dish. But this sandwich is like a gourmet burger on steroids. Gorgonzola and a smoked tomato aioli give the sandwich a ton of character, and add in bacon with the meatloaf and you have yourself a contender.

The fried green tomatoes are particularly disappointing, bland, and taste like they they came from the freezer.

The granola tastes like it came from the cereal aisle at Kroger and the combination of cinnamon with red onions and gorganzola just wasn't good.

The place is located kind of weirdly on the side of a building tucked behind some construction at the moment, but the hanging banners and frankly - ginormous - sign along the main street only just prevented me from turning early and getting lost. (Lost is kind of my forte).In any case, we were seated quickly and got our drinks. There was great happiness at the table when we discovered the lunch menu on the back page - huge portions still and a great lunch price tag! The options were only slightly pared down from the dinner menu, too so it still took us a while to decide.We ended up sharing an appetizer plate for the table and I got the Basil Noodles lunch portion as my main - spicy level 4 out of 5 - very hot. Per norm, we were treated to the yummy little broth soup that comes out to whet your appetite shortly after we ordered. Our appetizer platter came out fairly promptly after that and was plenty for the table of five even though it was two spring rolls and four dumplings. The chicken was moist and flavorful and he sauces that came out with the appetizer platter were very yummy with one sweet and spicy and another peanut butter-y goodness. We hadn't gotten to the point where hunger means you actually finish off the full appetizer platter before our main dishes came out. I really liked my spicy noodles - they were the perfect spicy level I'd expect when I ask for four out of five - flush to the face, slight sniffles start up and red lips can feel the capsicum. Mmm...I think the decor is a little cheesy, but neon lights aren't really my thing and it wasn't offensive at all - one big plus for dinners is that they didn't overcrowd the middle floor tables and (bonus!) their bathrooms were super clean.

It ruined the whole meal! We shared it family style amongst 3 people, and since it was approx 8 oz. a small portion was left in the serving plate. The fish was coated heavily with an egg batter and doused with chee chu sauce (pretty much a coconut based red curry slightly sweet), so it was initially hard to tell at first that the fish was had gone off. We informed the waitress and it was understandable that there was not much fish left in the plate, but informed her that the fish was bitter and not fresh. We did not ask for a discount or a refund at all but just asked her to inform the kitchen. There was no apology yet. Usually they take the dish back and if there was a question the chef usually tastes it to confirm but no such effort was made. Again this was not an individual's meal it was family style so it wasn't like eating someone's left overs. The waitress said \"I can give you a discount but you should have told me when there was more fish on the plate\". It was explained to her that three people took it as we were serving it family style, again no apology. She looked upset stating well I can give you a discount but not a refund since it's all gone!!! Again mind you no manager or owner came to inquire. After informing the service I felt I was being indirectly accused for not paying for the fish, so I told her to please charge us as that was not our intention but due to her bad attitude and bitter taste still lurking on all our taste buds, I did not leave a tip. When a new establishment serves rotten fish it tells me that they don't know how to handle/store \u00a0fish products or meats, or have a bad distributor, and don't care for the quality of food being served.

Luckily pizza and tacos are my main food groups so I was happy to trot next door to Bella's cute courtyard. My friends and I had some Yazoo at a great price, and shared bruschetta for an app. It was delicious-- heavy on the olive oil. The tomatoes were a bit pink, and I like them dark red and juicy. But hey, winter is barely over. For dinner I had the gnocchi. I spent more than I was looking to spend but it was worth every penny. A nice deep red sauce and cheesy goodness hugs the little potato filled pasta so well. So delicious! My friends really enjoyed their pizza and panini as well. The crust is fluffy and flavorful. Our server was very friendly and funny.

What an unexpected surprise. While there's never a bad time to eat pizza, I must say that coming to BN in the summer time is a joy. Why? Because of the alleyway. The alleyway (like someone mentioned above) is reminiscent of a movie set what with the strewn lights, brick facade and strains of live music. It's also fantastically romantic so fellas, if you're looking to charm your lady with a night out... I'm just sayin'. So, when it's warm, come here and eat in the alley (I know it sounds odd; I promise, it's a winner of an idea).But even if it's not warm, come here and eat. You'll have a marvelous time (and I never use that word). Come hungry, ready to explore the menu and be open to a progression of flavors. I started off with a New Fashioned Cocktail -- a twist on the classic Old Fashioned. Not only was it well-made, I was surprised to know that I could find great cocktails at an unassuming Italian restaurant. To pair with it (and whet my appetite), I started with the caprese salad. It was the standard caprese but all the ingredients were fresh and the flavor popped. By dinner time, I'd decided on the penne alla vodka and a bottle of wine. I know, I know... what about the pizza? Well, it wasn't a pizza kind of night but judging from the pies brought out to other tables, you can't go wrong with the pizza selection. My pasta was nicely-cooked, perfectly tossed with sauce and fairly populated with pancetta and onion. If you've had this dish before, you'll love it here. Again, the presentation/dish wasn't anything new but I wasn't ordering 'anything new.' I was ordering a comfortable stand-by and that's what I received. I found the waiter's description of the malbec to be right on the nose. The bottle was incredibly drinkable, fruity with a bit of a nutty finish. It's a great wine. What wasn't so great was the mark up. A glass of the stuff is just about as much as a bottle is to buy at the store. A bottle at BN will run you, about, 3 times what you'd pay at a store. It's a good wine. It pairs well with the food. It's drinkable. But don't gouge the customer on the markup. That was the only sore point of the evening. The service was a bit bumpy but our waiter was so earnest and was trying to so hard, I couldn't hold the snafus against him. Effort makes a difference -- as does ambiance. Would I have been so taken with the meal/evening had we sat inside? I don't know. I do know that the inside belies the quality of the food/drink you could/would expect at BN. And, perception is reality in many cases so... there's that.

The first time being the reason why I am now a Nashvillan (I should get a cape). Clearly I have been primed to only have the most positive experiences with the place. I hear the term \"tucked away\" used a lot with this restaurant. I would say that is an accurate descriptor. Bella Napoli is embedded into music row, allowing it to have a very quaint courtyard very reminiscent of al fresco dining in Italy (I just googled all these terms). After imbibing in spirits at Taco Mamacita, we found it convenient to stop by next door for dinner. I just want to first off say that do not let the pizzeria part of the name confuse young undergraduates and make them think this is a place you can get a $2 slice of pizza. Bella Napoli is not a place you want to go if you are following a strict budget. It is a place you want to go if you want high quality pizza... on someone else's tab. Each pizza will run you approximately $15 with the exception of the Margherita which will run you $13. In our group, we ordered the grilled chef salad ($15), the Margherita pizza (the true litmus test for pizza) and a calzone. The calzone can be easily shared amongst two people. Out of the three, hands down the Margherita pizza won. Well..we all know the salad was never in the running. I remember asking our server (who was fantastic) what were their vegan options. And I quote, \"the side salad.\" AND that's how I knew we were at an authentic place. No real pizzeria is going to use that frou frou fake dairy cheese stuff. Anyway, the Margherita pizza was spot on. It is about 11 inches in diameter (my roommate and I had a long discussion about this at 6 am today) and very thin. You can easily eat this as one person since it is A. freakin delicious and B. very thin crusted. The lightness of the pizza really enhanced the taste because it allowed for you to truly experience the sauce. I felt there was a very appropriate sauce to cheese ratio, as a lot of places don't quite understand the concept of a Margherita pizza. In regards to the calzone, my roommate would describe it as \"a good crust stuffed with the right amount of cheese.\" Sorry for that..he's a man, that's as imagery packed statement I'll ever get of a folded pizza from a guy.

She brought out a tiny little bowl of sauce for my daughter and I to share and my only complaint would be for when the bill came. \u00a0Asking for extra sauce when ordering became a $1.50 charge for each of us on the bill and then we were charged $2.00 for the tiny little cup of sauce for dipping. \u00a0I think that is outrageous!! \u00a0I mean, come on. \u00a0We got an extra teaspoonful or two of sauce for $1.50 each and not much more for another $2. \u00a0For that $5 I could have made a good size pot of sauce, even using San Marzano tomatoes. \u00a0 I cannot remember ever being charged for extra sauce at other Italian restaurants. \u00a0I also have to agree with some other reviewers here that recommended that they ought to serve some bread or rolls to patrons when they come in. \u00a0I mean, come on...would it kill them to put a little basket of bread out with some olive oil for dipping? \u00a0Lastly, I think they may have recently raised their prices for alcohol and wine beverages. \u00a0I ordered a glass of Moscato for which I was charged $9.00 which I consider to be a bit high. \u00a0After this experience, I may just go in for the lunch special which is a pretty good deal although the last time I had that my side salad that came with the pizza had shrunk from previous visits during lunch. \u00a0Hopefully, Paolo (the owner) will take some of our suggestions and quit nickel and diming his patrons for things like sauce that should be offered gratis and hey, put out some bread or rolls because many times there's a bit of a wait for the food to come out.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 1 review", "date": "2015-05-03"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nCarolyn S.\n", "review": "Very good, I hold pizza to a different standard now because of this pizza.

I think the entire EV is very cute and cozy but the area that BNP has taken ownership of with picnic tables, Italian music and hanging lights are enough alone for a return visit. Molto Bella!Secondly, the inside actually transports you, rather seamlessly, with the lack of windows and Italian channel T.V., to a small Italian eatery in a village in Italy. So the atmosphere made up for what we found to be a lacking meal for our first visit.I have heard great things and was excited about trying the pizza. My husband opted for the Chicken Parmigiana which I was afraid wouldn't live up to his distant, both figuratively and literally, memories. The waiter was very attentive and the Ruffini Chianti was moderately priced but generously served. We ordered the Antipasti Platter as a starter and all of it was fair. We enjoyed the coupling of two slices of pizza bread with the meats, but could have used more. The bruschetta piece was small and crumpled on impact dropping much of its offering on to my plate below. My husband didn't care of the bologna, which is strange. I found it rather bland but pleasantly thinly sliced.I prefer my pizza unsliced and that is the way it came. It was not soggy at all as I have read in other reviews. In fact it was a bit dry. The tomato sauce was used sparingly and that is my favorite part! The pizza dough was cooked to perfection and therefore I will return.My husband actually left some of the chicken un-eaten, which is unheard of, so I knew without tasting it that it was run-of-the-mill at best. He chose to eat the penne it was served on without it. He said it was \"OK\", and he would definitely order something else next time.

Their pizza tastes (as far as I can tell) as though nothing has been added that should not be--like dough conditioners to hold the dough together, or silicone to keep the cheese from clumping.Additionally, their marinara sauce is a bit runnier than the uber-concentrated paste that often ends up on most pizza. Thicker sauce generally tastes sweeter as it contains more sugar per volume. Also, thicker sauce has less water, creating a less soggy crust. But, I prefer the Bella approach which is to use a relatively thinner sauce, and create a crust that is crispy, chewy, and YES, a little soggy all at the same time!Overall, the pizza reminds me of the pizza that I had in Naples, Italy 15 years ago. I don't know if I'll ever get to travel back over there, so I am thankful that a place like Bella is so close to home.I think most of the negative reviews on here ( those who complain of not enough flavor, and soggy ingredients) were probably expecting something similar to Mellow Mushroom or Papa Johns, or perhaps pizza with way too much salt added and processing chemicals.I have only one complaint about the pizza. It comes out burnt. This, I believe is intentional. It is a more authentic pizza experience, but I would prefer the bottom of the crust be golden brown instead of black. Not just because charred food is generally considered carcinogenic, but I also prefer the taste.

All the more reason for him to daydream about his next visit here. First of all, the alleyway and outside seating area is absolutely adorable. I felt like I was on Mulberry Street in New York, surrounded by tiny Italian string lights, a wrought iron fence and checkered tablecloths. We started with two appetizers - the mussels and the stuffed eggplant. Both were a light start to the meal, well seasoned for the most part (the eggplant needed a little salt) and had me excited for what was to come - the Parma pizza. Jeez.This may be an ambitious thing to say, but even having spent significant time in New York, this may be the best pizza I've ever had. I try not to make broad statements like that, but I feel like it's deserved in this case. The crust is thin but chewy, with lovely blisters from wood-firing. The toppings in the case of the Parma were classic and served up generously - fresh Buffalo mozzarella, crispy, salty prosciutto, diced tomatoes and a heaping pile of arugula that eventually wilted into a delicious, melty m\u00e9lange of flavor and lovely mouthfeel. I'm going to have to stop myself now.For dessert, we tried the tiramisu - another dish I've enjoyed countless versions of, and I was pleased with Bella Napoli's version. Nothing innovative or original here - just a straight-up, well done tiramisu. Our server was quick, fun and well-informed. The owner thanked us for coming and made sure we enjoyed our meal.

Nothing special about the tables (uncomfortable, but compared to the outside GREEN PLASTIC table and chairs) this was our option. Outside area is quaint and the setting is inviting but the green plastic furniture..TURN OFF..it would be much better with cast iron/metal cafe tables..not this cheap lawn furniture..My husband opted for the Lasagna al Forno $13 and I chose the Fettuccine alla Boscaiola $14 and our appetizer was the Bruschetta $6; I took a iced tea with lemon/lime unsweetened and he chose the budweiser bottle beer..now here we go!Bruschetta was described as: Toasted bread, served with cherry diced tomatoes, olive oil , fresh chopped garlic and fresh basil; It was not TOASTED but it was good. The topping made it very soggy, too soggy but I enjoyed it. My hubby had one (you get 6..they are a $1 each) he hated it said too soggy..couldn't handle the soggy oily bread..but I ate the rest and you will see why soon.Here comes the food about 20 minutes into our order...not bad if crowded but we are only table inside and there are about three outside (drinking college aged customers) so I would hate to see how slow on crowded night. Now keep in mind..there is about 20 employees for the dining room milling around us..and not one ask us anything. I had to return my tea (colored water with no flavor) and get a soda..we were there total of 1 hr and 30 minutes and no one asked me if I wanted a refill..I was livid!!now our entrees: Tony's Lasagna is described as; Fresh pasta sheet layered with meat sauce mozzarella, bechamel ,and parmigiano--sounds divine..well it was burnt cheese from the fire oven, with gobs of tomato sauce poured over to hide the burnt cheese..but you can taste it guys..Tony and I split it. He liked his portion; I had to give him some of my half back..it was horrible, but I liked the tomato sauce..I needed it here in a bit.

Tony took 2 bites and we pushed it back. We asked for bread to go with our pasta meals and they brought us BURNT thin pizza crust..NO BREAD in an italian restaurant. we asked for parmesan..they handed us shakers of kraft ...no REAL PARMESAN Cheese..I thought this said ITALIAN restaurant on the doorThank God I had my Bruschetta left over that was my dinner..5 pieces of bruschetta (soggy but the best damn thing on my table) with one soda..You dont get any bread or side salads when you order this food.

\u00a0We just spent 250 bucks with you - and you can't give us a split ticket? \u00a0Given the fact that the pizza wasn't good and the server, although he was polite, kept our drinks filled, etc - wouldn't budge on splitting checks. \u00a0With 9 people, splitting 4 ways wasn't really practical. \u00a0Some ordered alcohol. \u00a0Some ordered salads. \u00a0Some ordered dessert. \u00a0There wasn't a fair way to split it. \u00a0Just really put a bad taste in my mouth. \u00a0That, coupled with the goopy, doughy, poorly seasoned pizza with too strong of a smoke flavor in the crust just made this a no-go for future pizza. \u00a0I have had much better pizza elsewhere. \u00a0Everything may not be imported from Italy. \u00a0But last time I checked - just because it's imported doesn't mean it's good. \u00a0Ask former owners of a Le Car or Yugo. \u00a0Or hell, even the old Fiat's.Its a pass for future outings. \u00a0The only real saving grace was the tiramisu. \u00a0It was pretty good. \u00a0But that's not enough to have me go again.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 86 reviews", "date": "2011-04-06"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nMorgan L.\n", "review": "I've been to Bella Napoli four times now, and every time I have a better experience than the last.

The staff were all really nice to my 15 mo toddler, the high chairs were in good repair, and my son is a huge fan of the bruschetta. Vegetarian-friendly scale:A lot of the dishes have prosciutto or other cured meats, but there are several vegetarian options available and I think they'd be willing to leave the meats off of other dishes as well.

Even more slim are Nashville's Neapolitan pizza options, of which Bella Napoli is one of the select few.

The baseline of any pizza for me is the Margheraita and theirs lives up to my standards. The real shining star for me though is the Capricciosa which is baked ham, mushrooms, and mozzarella. I have become quite the hater of meat on a pizza lately but it really all comes together on this platter of pie perfection. The crust is also superb and on par with other Neapolitan pizzas I have experienced. Honestly even the worst Neapolitan crust I have had was better than most great traditional crusts so that is saying quite a bit.

After we went the first time, I think I would have given it 5 stars. At first I thought the pizza was awesome; it has definitely been tasty every time I've gone, but unfortunately, every time we go, both the pizza and the experience were less awesome. Yes, the food is good, but it's not like you're being mentally whisked away to eat at a little cafe in Sicily, the way they'd like you to think. Their downfalls are a few things. One, they're way too expensive; every time we went it was because we had a Groupon or Living Social Coupon, and even with the $30 removed from the check, I ways always surprised at how much everything costs, and then disappointed when I consider how much what we just ate was worth to me. (believe me though, I'm no cheapskate when it comes to good food, but there needs to be a cost-to-worth ratio that works)Second, they're trying to do this \"ultra hipster meets authentic Italy meets reclaimed warehouse meets loud sports bar\" thing that just doesn't work for me. This translates to snobby hipster college kids wearing stupid hats and thick-rimmed glasses thinking that the exposed brick, loud TVs, bar, and imported tomato sauce is making them cooler just for being there. If you're into that, fine, but that's not the experience I'm looking for, neither for good authentic pizza, nor a dining experience in general.Third, they're inconsistent. I know for a fact that the pizza I ordered the 2nd time I was there wasn't covered with lots of diced tomatoes (I hate raw tomatoes), yet the next time I order it, I'm picking piles of tomatoes off. \u00a0I also know that the first 2 times I was there, they served the pizza cut into slices. The 3rd time, they set the pizza down whole; when I ask him to cut it, he goes into this argument about how they don't cut it because that's \"authentic.\" Interesting trivia tidbit, but cut my pizza because that's how American eat pizza AND you weren't this \"authentic\" last time. (\"authentic\" quite possible meant \"lazy\" that night)Fourth, (at least to me) it seems they don't care to improve their business to create a better customer experience. They refuse to do call ahead or reservations; I know that's pretty common in Nashville, but \"everyone else is doing it\" isn't a good reason for anything. Why not reward return customers with the opportunity to not cram into that tiny hallway or wait for a table? Also, when it's warm they have some outdoor seating, but it's not covered. It would be so easy to cover that part of the building with a retractable awning. Instead, their customers get rained on, so they have to stop eating and quickly move all the tables to another area. \u00a0They also told us there was a 30 minute wait when there were obviously 3 vacant tables right there. \u00a0I know I didn't know the whole story, but whatever the reason, making customers wait while they stare at empty tables is a bad idea. Also, the TVs are really distracting, If they got rid of the TVs, amped up the customer service, and focused on consistent customer experiences, they could really improve the whole experience a lot.Fifth, now that I think about it, the food isn't so awesome. It's definitely good, don't get me wrong, but awesome enough to wait for 30 minutes to get a table, to wait another 30 minutes to get your food to pay $20 for a pizza a little bigger than a dinner plate that changes the recipe every time you go? Once, yes, twice, maybe, 3+ times? Nope.Bottom line: if you've never been, go, it's a good experience to have and the food is good. However, if you're looking for a quiet spot to have a discussion over great food, don't bother. There are plenty of places that do great pizza, this isn't your only choice.

My friend had a restaurant coupon for him and his girl, while I chose to order from their happy hour specials. When the bill came, they refused to honor the lower prices for me and instead just gave us the coupon for our whole bill. Not good. I anticipated it would be about 20 dollars for all of us after the coupon and half price pizza, but it ended up being about 65 dollars, including tip which was part of the coupon. A shocker to say the least. Any other place on the planet would have been happy to oblige us with separate checks and honored any specials they had running. 2) They burned my first pizza and then tried to argue that it wasn't burnt. I really hate it when restaurants do that. We had two pizzas side by side. My friend's pizza was nicely browned with a hint of black. Mine was completely black and tasted of coal.

I'm very picky about the kind of sauce that goes on pizzas, and while my pizza was sauceless, the tomato sauce on my husband's pizza was tangy, fresh and light, not at all like the kind that seems like canned tomato paste. Also, the service was really speedy - we had our meal within 15 to 20 minutes of ordering, which I didn't expect at all!The atmosphere was also great! We dined al fresco in the little alleyway outside the restaurant, which was delightful and really made us feel we were somewhere other than Nashville.

WE WAITED 15 MINUTES before anyone came to our table, and that was only because my sister got up and complained....some lady came over and got our drink orders.(by this time I was ready to go but we had already paid for the groupon to try the place out, I'm SO thankful we didn't pay full price for this place)4.)

So, use your Groupon at dinner, when it actually makes a difference. First was the salad, which was listed as having olives.

We were waited on by two servers, both very friendly and extremely attentive. We were brought some pita (which was good but could have been warmed a bit to make it better) and a plate of assorted fresh herbs (mint, anise, cilantro), a radish, cubes of feta and some butter. Honestly we didn't know what to do with the herbs, but ordered some hot tea and the mint came in handy. I ordered the House club plate which consisted of gyro meat, chicken, grilled onions, peppers, mushrooms and tomatoes (think fajita style) and a large serving of rice and a shirazi salad. My fiance ordered the Chicken and Barg kabobs that also came with rice. My meal was fantastic- very flavorful and cooked to perfection and very reasonably priced ($9.99). The vegetables were cooked perfectly and everything (including the rice) was seasoned very well. I am not normally nuts about gyro meat but this was the best I have had in Nashville. The shirazi salad was delicious as well, especially on a hot day. My fiance's kabobs, again, were cooked perfectly. I tried some of the Barg (tenderloin) and it was tender and flavorful. I would definitely order the House Club again, and while my fiance really enjoyed his, he said he would probably opt for something a little less pricey next time ($20.99). We skipped out on desert since we were both very full by then but the waitress said the Persian ice cream is very popular and we want to try it next time around.

It was our first visit, spurred by a Groupon purchase, and I am sure to return on account of the food and the service. After promptly being seated, our server brought lentil soup, lavash, cilantro, and feta to our table. We proceeded to snack down immediately, as we had arrived with an appetite. The soup was a light, welcome antidote to the rain outside. We ordered hummus to round out the pre-entree experience. It had a strong tahini flavor that I enjoyed. My entree was the chicken kabob with lamb shank, and my companion enjoyed the Sultani, a combination of two spiced meat kabobs similar to kefta. To say that all meat was juicy or tender would be an understatement; slow and low techniques truly brought out the best in these meals. Stuffed, we ordered rich Turkish coffee and baklava, planning to pack all leftovers for later consumption.I would be remiss to not mention the service at Shish Kabob, which enhanced our meal considerably. The servers, apparently brothers, were kind, warm, and helpful. All interactions were hospitable and pleasant, and I felt welcomed into their establishment to share their food.

Maybe I just don't like the flavors of middle eastern food. Whichever it is Shish Kabob food and my palate aren't likely to meet again because ....A restaurant can mess up rice, but it's slightly hard to do. ... They managed it in a very unusual manner. The rice tasted ... stale. Which is pretty weird cause rice usually lasts just about forever and tastes the same today as it will ten years from now. \u00a0I tried throughout the meal to take bites of it thinking it might taste better or that my taste buds were off, but it still tasted old and stale and I just couldn't finish it. I did really enjoy the gratis salad of cilantro, feta cheese, and olive oil served with bread. Nice light flavorful start to a meal, that. The lentil soup served with it was ok. (some part of it at least came from a can, darn my taste buds for being able to tell)The meat I got was lamb shank and a ground meat kebab. The lamb shank was huge, as in I wanted to act like a barbarian and grab it in both hands and gnaw on it huge. It was good. Fall off the bone tender. The ground meat kebob ended up being taken home as dog food. It wasn't the way it looked (like a very long but limp piece of male anatomy normally not eaten in polite societies). It was the taste that was off putting. Not sure if it was the spices, the texture of the ground meat, or the flavor of the meat itself, but whatever it was I just couldn't do it. The hummus was nice. It had a really rich deep but not too overpowering flavor of sesame. Not sure if it was tahini or sesame oil mixed in, but whatever it was it worked well. Not the best hummus I've ever had, but it and the salad were the only things I really enjoyed here.To end on a good note, the service was wonderful.

My husband's sausage slices were really 2 slices of cheese pizza (previously baked) that they threw sausage on and reheated. Not impressive, but he said it was delicious. They did initially mess up my husband's order (they gave him pepperoni instead), but they happily and quickly corrected it. Don't plan on this place for a quick bite, unless you order slices of pizza. It took about 20 minutes for our order to be ready.

Sure there are Southern staples like Arnold's Country Kitchen that immediately come to mind, but would you believe that a NY-style pizza parlor is also at the top of my list?Just so we're all clear: Manny's is a total dive. It may not be a literal hole in the wall, but it's close. Walking into this place is sort of like walking into a vortex that takes you back to a friend's super shady basement rec room, or maybe a 1980s arcade (there are even a few of those vintage machines hanging about). Only difference? None of those places had 'za like this! While the crust here doesn't qualify for thin crust status, it's some of the best I've ever had: crispy with a nice bite to it (never soggy!), but also soft and pillowy at the same time. There aren't (m)any other pizza places in Nashville that I feel are good enough to let simplicity shine, but at Manny's just a simple cheese slice (or even a peperoni slice, if you've just gotta have some meat) is a celebration for the senses. The flavors are fresh and clean, truly a slice of heaven! I have also recently taken to trying out their \"rolls\", which are essentially stuffed pizza dough. The spinach roll may be one of the best things I've ever eaten - so garlicky and rich, and the side of marinara sauce was so packed with basil flavor I loudly proclaimed my desire to take a bath in it on several occasions!Like I said, atmosphere is somewhat lacking (though I admit that Manny's has its own kind of gruff charm) but the food is so good, it hardly matters. If the stale eau de 80s is a turnoff, it's easy enough to get your meal to go (we have certainly called ahead for pick up when we know we want an entire pie). The only other downside to the place is that the hours are pretty limited (they close at 6 pm on days that they're open), but even this inconvenience can't keep me away. Oh, also it's downtown, in the Arcade, so parking is an issue, but if you call ahead, you can park in the Arcade and nip in for your pizza without a problem.It's not really an exaggeration to say that when I'm not eating Manny's pizza, I'm dreaming about it.

Having grown up in Memphis as well as frequented all of the major BBQ cities of the country, I'm pretty picky with my Q. As soon as I saw the giant smoker outside, I had a feeling the rumors of good and honest BBQ were true. I walked in and there are only a few tables for dining in. There's not much as far as decor but that's not what I look for or expect at any decent BBQ joint. I ordered the rib plate with smoked cabbage and greens. The ribs were fall of the bone, tender, and perfectly smokey. On top of the delicious meat, the smoked cabbage was insanely good.

Walk up to the counter, place your order and wait.... Very small place (think Bolton's)...Great big smoker out in the parking lot, cranking everyday.I have driven by here countless times but it wasn't until today that I noticed the big smoker - smoking up and making the air smell like smoked meat..Their moto is \"A pig ain't got a chance\" and I can tell you what a nice surprise it was.I was across the street, looking out the windows of where I was and saw the smoke coming out of the big smoker and I asked my merchant if he had ever tried any of their BBQ and his eyes lit up and he said \"YEAH, it's Goooood!\"So after finishing my business, I drove across the street and walked in.. Everyone was cheerful and people were eating out of styrofoam cups - Brisket chili!I told them I had never been there but I was a Bolton fan and they told me, \"Wait till you try our chicken....\"I ordered the 10 smoked wings - no sides.(brought my chicken wings home (10 for $7.50 + tax)and devoured them.. smoked, slow burn, (I should have asked for more spice), dry rubbed, delicious, melt in my mouth good. While \"Dad\" was making my wings, everyone else was telling me about their product.Packer's Brisket that they smoke..Brisket Chili, Brisket on a plate, on bread, in a chili....He told me his hot dogs were to die for, and that he makes his own BBQ sauce... No bottled crap.Sides are extra \u00a0$1.75 and $3.50 and they include; fries, cole slaw, potato salad, baked beans, smoked cabbage, grilled corn.Extras are 25 cents - pickles, onion, tomato & sauces)A different dessert (homemade) everyday.Dad told me he used a dry rub on his pork ribs..Fried fish sandwiches are Whiting and Catfish..They also serve burgers and cheeseburgers.Prices are very low... \u00a0nice for those of us that don't need bread or sides...Hours are M-Thur 11am to 10pmFri & Sat 11 to midnight.I can't wait to try Dad's brisket.

Definitely the best of either I have had in East Nashville - superior to Edleys, \u00a0Cantrells , and Drifters which were our main BBQ options before this one opened. The brisket is tender and flavorful with the perfect amount of smoke flavor, and the pork has a nicely varied texture. I am not a huge barbecue expert and haven't tried many of the places in the Nashville area generally considered to be great but I was very happy with this as a local option. I hope some more expert barbecue eaters review it soon. The sides I had were fine but more forgettable, including the brisket chili. The brisket in it was great, and it had good texture, but the chile flavor was distinctly chili powdery. This is a place that seems to specialize in meat (the smoker out front is always delightfully smoky) with the accompaniments beyond meat being more pedestrian. The fries are fresh cut though so as long as you eat them fast they are tasty. Both sauces I tried were very good. Talking to my high school age cashier (who was the niece, I think, of G himself though she may have been his daughter) each member of the family makes their own sauce. Several hotness levels and varieties to choose from. And I think everybody in the restaurant when I went was part of the family. They were very welcoming and encouraged us to come back, talked to us about our two year old, and G even gave him a free piece of strawberry cake on the way out. We will be back.
