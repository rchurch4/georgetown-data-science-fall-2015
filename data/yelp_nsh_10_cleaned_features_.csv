We showed up at out reservation time and gave the hostess the name we put it under earlier, and they said they didn't have us down at all. Then they seated us and a waiter came up and started addressing our table and then was rudely interrupted and intercepted by another waiter by saying ""I know my tables"". After he claimed our table, he then took our drink order and when we all ordered waters, he rudely said ""Bueller, Bueller, Bueller."" The best part of this meal occurred when my family and I got up in order to serve ourselves at the salad bar...During our waiters introduction, he said that he would bring cheesy bread, garlic mashed potatoes, and fried bananas during our meal. We then got one of the three sides. Then we asked for them twice when they didn't serve the rest of the sides. During the meal when the meats came around, my mom asked for medium rare and got a piece of meat that was cold to touch and purple when she cut into it. Once we'd finished all of our food, the absent waiter came to our table with the mashed potatoes and fried banana only for us to say we were done and wanted to see what deserts they had to offer. Granted, the manager came by and asked about the meal and we told them our experience. She then took $25 dollars off and provided a dessert and cheesy bread to go.

"210 25th Ave NNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"I want to preface this review with the fact that I'm not a huge red meat eater. I've never went out & ordered a steak at a restaurant, I'm not sure why, I just enjoy chicken & seafood more. Why would I come to a Brazilian steakhouse that has men walking around with meat on skewers? Well I was invited to dine here with a restaurant reviewer, & I thought it would be something different to try. The restaurant is very nice. It's upscale but I don't feel like it's putting on airs about it. All the staff I encountered were very friendly. Our server was nice, but almost robotic in his description of the food & the concept. Speaking of the concept, you sit down & first are able to pick what you'd like from the salad bar. Then once your done you flip a red card over to green, this indicates to the meat men that you're in the market for some meat. I had a ""Brazilian Allure"" cocktail that had vodka but tasted mainly like cotton candy. It was super sweet. Too sweet for me. It was $12. Salad bar, I would call it more of a cold bar, they had lettuce yes, & dressing but other than that there isn't really anything that I'd put on a salad. They have artisan salami & cheeses, olives & even some hot rice & white wine sautéed mushrooms that were great. Onto the meat. I ate probably more than I should at the salad bar because I could've left then & been fine, but the meat was a calling. I could smell it. It's not hard to notice it because at any given point there isn't about 4-5 guys walking around with the stuff. This isn't a place to bring a vegan or vegetarian because the meat smell is everywhere. Along with the meat, your server brings you mashed potatoes & fried banana to ""cleanse your palate"" as he told us. I tried the flank steak, garlic beef, Parmesan pork chop, Brazilian sausage & another meat that I cannot remember. Everything was hot and tasted fresh. If I was a red meat lover I would've been in heaven, but I enjoyed trying it all. After you've stuffed yourself with meat, the server brings by a tray of the different cakes & pies they have. The dessert is the only thing you're allowed to take home with you. I sampled the carrot cake and the bananas foster pie. Both were good but I wasn't blown away by them. I suspect they aren't made in house. The price. For salad bar only its 24.95, & if you want the meat & the salad bar it's 44.99.

You start off with their appetizer bar which really could be a whole entree. The appetizer bar is top notice with gourmet and artisan selections you won't find else where. Then when you're ready they start bringing out different cuts of succulent meats and won't stop till you say so. I highly recommend the rib eye and the bacon wrapped filet mignon. You'll also be served their garlic mash potatoes and those decadent fried plantains....Here are some tips before you arrive:1) dip your meats into their lobster bisque...2) eat as many of their cheese puff rolls as possible3) savor every delicious momentLong live the dynasty of Texas de Brazil",Texas de Brazil,6153200013,51.0,2015-02-15,"Franklin, TN",/biz/texas-de-brazil-nashville,5.0,43,"Nashville, TN",Leah V.,36.1622296,-86.774353,35.1680139,-86.1084401,78.11414522602897,False,1070.0

"210 25th Ave NNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"Let me start this with telling you how much I have enjoyed this restaurant in both Memphis and Richmond....but that was several years ago. I was so pleased to learn one had opened in Nashville so we could celebrate my birthday there. The restaurant is beautiful and in a great area of town. BUT...we never had a chance except to have two glasses of Malbec at $10 a glass sitting at the bar. As we arrived, parking was crazy! We could not make the turn off of Elliston/West End as the cars for the valet were backed-up to the light. Parking was for both Kobe Steakhouse and Texas de Brazil. We waited in the line about 5 minutes and saw a spot by the park, deciding a good walk after dinner would be nice.Upon entering, a very young hostess greeted us by saying her reservations were all running late and we would have to wait 20-25 minutes. We could see empty tables and since this was a Sat night, thought somewhat odd. Well, we waited about 15 minutes and another hostess approached us addressing us with the wrong name. She admitted she was confused and went on with her hunt. At that point my husband confessed, ""It took three times calling for me to make the reservation. I was hung up on once, there was no answer and I then finally got someone."" As we sat at the bar, I noticed a staff member come from the back with a small cardboard box that was torn open. A bartender took three or four small fluted glasses directly out of the box, without washing, placed them on a tray, filled them and a waitress picked them up to serve to a table in the back. OMG!  After witnessing this, I approached the hostess. I advised her about what I had just seen and questioned her, ""we've been waiting over 30 minutes since our reservation time. When will we be seated?"" She only offered they had just opened. I replied, ""You guys have been open at this location for at least two months....with good reviews. You have locations in multiple cities."" The hostess could offer no suggestion when we would be seated. I noticed that a table of guys behind us, although they were seated when we arrived still had not been served. They did not appear too happy! However, a table that was seated with apologies shortly after we arrived were enjoying their meal. We waited another 20 minutes with no one offering to seat us, merely smiling at us from the hostess station. The crowd at the hostess station was changing but it's unclear if they were being seated or leaving due to the wait. However, my husband indicates a large party was seated after we arrived. Being frustrated my husband made a reservation at another restaurant. Upon leaving a bartender bumped into my husband and he was so grumpy at this point, kept walking out the door. I mentioned to her we had waited over 45 minutes WITH  A RESERVATION, looking at that empty table in the corner the entire time. THEN she offered to seat us! I kept walking... at least the chilly walk back to the car served to calm us down after such a frustrating experience! Thank you Texas de Brazil for such a nice birthday surprise! LOL. The moral of the story, make a reservation at another restaurant as a back-up plan... don't  wait like we did and have your celebration spoiled!

A bottle of Sriracha fixed that quickly.

So we passed this place running errands this afternoon and thought, ""hey, I've never noticed that there before by the tunnel?"" So after a few stops, we head into the parking lot to scope the place out. I jump on Yelp on my phone to check the reviews. Solid reviews... no terrible ones... oh and a Yelp special discount! Oh damn... weekdays only. So we go inside, past the walls of bamboo and have a seat at a table (No booths BTW). Our waiter comes over pretty quickly to get our drinks and greet us. I notice that the sodas on the drink menu used to say ""no refills,"" but the ""no"" has been marked out. The blonde orders a Dr Pepper, and I (the heathen) order a Coke. They bring out a full, iced glass for both of us AND unopened cans of Coke and Dr Pepper!?! WOOHOO! Coke with a Coke chaser! It's the little things that thrill me. After all, if my waiter keeps my drink full, everything else can be crappy and I will still tip at least 20%. We all look over the menu trying to decide what to get. The Vegan orders the Yellow Curry w/ Tofu. The blonde orders the Pad Kee Mau with chicken (Drunkard Noodle). I order the String bean w/ chicken... hold the Jesus. We also got a couple fresh spring rolls. While not the best fresh spring rolls I've ever had, they were pretty good... not as flavorful as say, King Market or PS Noodle Pot. So the food comes out shortly after we finish the fresh spring rolls. Good portions across the board. We all start to chow and remark how great each of our dishes are. So we then start trying eachother's food. Seriously... some of the BEST yellow Thai curry I've ever tasted. The drunkard noodles were amazing too. And of course, my string bean chicken was awesome. The service was excellent throughout the meal. We had both a waiter and waitress come around for drink refills and status checks and everything. Not pushy, but very attentive and the type of service that just made you feel welcome. Noticed several people come in to get carryout while we were there. Also several couples with about 6-8 tables filled. This place isn't far from work for me and is kinda on the way home.

And I'm curious what the chef would do if we ordered a ""regular Thai feast"" in advance. We did that once as a group at Smiling Elephant, and it was revelatory.We wandered in on a very hot Saturday afternoon, and the atmosphere was cool and pleasant. Were immediately greeted warmly, told to seat ourselves - the seats, by the way, are comfortable even at my wife's petit height.The chef himself came out when my wife ordered ""Thai hot"" to make sure she meant it - and for the very first time in Nashville, she was served something truly Thai hot. I asked about Yum Woon Sen, one of my absolute favorite bean thread salads that was not on the menu, and he assured me he could make it. What came really didn't bear much of a resemblance to any YWS I'd had before, anywhere in the world, and though the basic cold noodle salad with some veggies and chicken and shrimp was all right, it was a bit disappointing when I'd been expecting something else. My own personal test of Thai restaurants are the Larb Gai and the Tom Yum soup. His Larb Gai was fine, though nowhere near as delicate as Smiling Elephant's. And at a requested ""seven hot"", it was really really spicy. Almost too much, obscuring the taste of the food. I don't know how Smiling Elephant manages to do lethally hot dishes and retain their delicacy and taste, but this restaurant could use a bit of help in that direction.Service was fine, the girl serving was pretty young but nice. She didn't check back with us at all, though; we had to find her to ask for the check, or motion from across the room to catch her eye when we needed something. But still, she was pleasant and professional otherwise. Unfortunately, Smiling Elephant has set a standard for Nashville Thai that's going to be difficult to beat.

Just a funky, odd flavor.  It was the equivalent of drinking clean tap water with a bad taste to it. You drink it because you're thirsty.

It wasn't even Pad Thai. It was a plastic container filled with your basic run of the mill Chinese food concoction (no tofu btw). Water chestnuts, beans, carrots in a salty, watery soy based sauce. The crispy noodles were in a separate box and were not stir fried at all.  I decided to live with what I got and I have to say it really sucked. The crab rangoons were passable.  They had an almost medicinal, for lack of better description, taste to them. Kind of funky.  The fresh spring rolls were good.Anyway, I hate to bitch.

"2100 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"I'm going to start by dividing people reading this into three camps: Steakhouse Lovers, Steakhouse Detractors, and then everyone else who would ask why they should go to one.I'm going to address the third group because people who frequent or hate Steakhouses need not pay attention to my review anyway. I've been to Morton's in Nashville and Sullivan's in Austin, so while I'm no aficionado, I did know what to expect. Ruth's Chris is a chain and while it's nice, I'm sure local-lovers and Steakhouse experts would know more of why that would matter.For those not familiar with such an establishment, know this: there is likely to be little available at Ruth's Chris that you will find unfamiliar. It's traditional steakhouse fair presented with an almost manic sense of understatement. Their steaks are served a la carte, as is almost everything else including sides. This is typical for this type of place. You're supposed to feel like your steak is a Cadillac and your sides and salads are expensive options you add. I wouldn't buy a car with air conditioning sold separately, but I don't drive an expensive car.The good: Portions are generous and everything that hit the table was high quality. Our salads were great, fresh and tasty. My Chop Salad was like a wonderful cole slaw with blue cheese. Steaks were seared with a flavorful crust of char, creepy tender, and cooked to temp-perfection. I had a NY strip and devoured it greedily. Cocktails were surprisingly creative and tasty, and their wine list was large if somewhat over-priced. Service was good and the ambiance was nice and pretty comfortable.The less-good: I just don't get the value proposition of Steakhouses like this. My strip was $46. By itself. Sure, it's all about quality, but making something outrageously expensive doesn't make it taste better. Adherence to traditional Steakhouse means limited choices outside of steak. The dining room's climate control was off- there was a period where it was sweltering and then abruptly cooled off. Likely an unlucky moment. Valet park- don't even dream of self parking at this location.So there you go. Steakhouse regulars will complain that I'm complaining about Steakhouses in general. Steakhouse haters will not understand that it's still a good meal.

For the details, continue on...I took a trip here alone to see for myself what this restaurant was capable of. To get a fair idea of how the food quality and taste was, I ordered a variety of different things (and spent a heck of a lot of money!). But that's OK, because I went in prepared to spend to enjoy myself.I ordered the Lamb Chops for $40, the Lobster Macaroni and Cheese side for around $16, and the Creamed Spinach side for around $9. For dessert, I had the Bread Pudding for around $15 (or somewhere around there). Based on the price and the reviews, I was expecting a 5/5 experience for each and every dish, but this expectation for excellence and perfection did not necessarily hold. Oh, it was definitely good, just not as good as I had psyched myself out to believe. The lamb chops were cooked pleasingly tender and I loved how the edges were burnt just right to add that bit of charcoal flavor to the meat and fat. However, I could not taste the mint, and the overall flavor impact was not there. I felt like it needed something to make it less bland. For $40, I should not be thinking this at all. The lobster macaroni and cheese was delicious, but again, the cheese was runny and rather bland, and the flavor did not ""pop"" the way I was hoping. The creamed spinach was OK. It seemed like a very simple side; there was nothing fantastic about it. I found myself thinking that each spoonful was costing me $0.50 instead of how wonderful it was. Finally, the bread pudding is what made my night. It was easily the best tasting dish of all my courses and had the best presentation. The service here was something I admired greatly. My waiter stood in a corner monitoring all of his tables to see if they needed anything immediately. Because he was overlooking multiple tables, I didn't feel awkward or singled out. In between courses, my waiter arranged the plates and glasses in front of me to best suit my reach. He would also scrape any crumbs off the table with some sort of flat instrument; that was a unique experience.

No problem getting a table for 1 and I was not made to feel strange for asking for it. I dined late and was also not rushed or anything. Service is superb. Towards the end of the meal, when the place was clearing out, my server was super friendly and kept chatting me up but not in an annoying way. The food; You come to Ruth's Chris for the steaks and they are worth every penny. You cannot buy steaks like this at the grocery. I had the filet, cooked perfectly medium rare. And really, for the price it has to be perfect and I've never been disappointed at a Ruth's Chris. I started off with a tuna appetizer that was quite nice. Ceasar salad was a typical caesar salad. I don't think they are made fresh? But it was good. Along with my steak I had the lobster mac n cheese which was devine. Yes, that's a lot of food for one person! The server was surprised at how much I ordered. But, I LOVE to take home steak from a good steak place and have it cold the next day. It's my secret guilty pleasure. I had half of my filet and half the mac n cheese and it was just as good the next day as when it was first served. My one complaint was that they asked for my name when I asked for a table. No big deal. But everyone that came to my table called me Mr M______ all night long. By the end of the meal that just became annoying. I know they were just trying to make me feel special? But I've been to other Ruth's Chris spots where they did not do that to me. It's minor, but like I said was a bit annoying all night. Having said all that, I would probably give it 4.5 stars if I could. If I'm in a town with a Smith & Wollensky I would prefer to eat there. They have better appetizer and side selections I think.

We knew that we could definitely get it at Ruth Chris because of the experience we had with the one in Virginia Beach. We celebrated our 3rd Anniversary there and everything was exquisite! So we went ahead and made a reservation to eat at 7:15pm. We got there and there were a lot of people standing outside waiting for the valet to get their vehicles. Not a big deal, it's Saturday night in Nashville. We waited approximately 5 minutes to hand my vehicle over to the valet and proceeded down to the restaurant's hostess, whom had a pleasant smile. We arrived right on time ready to be seated. Unfortunately our table wasn't ready. What's the point of a reservation if you are not going to get your table at the time prescribed. Especially at a pricey place like Ruth Chris. Anyway, we had to go wait/stand in the bar area. Needless to say, my wife wasn't very happy. We waited about 10 minutes before they came and got us. This place is nothing like the Ruth Chris in Virginia Beach. It was very crowded. It's as if they put so many tables in the place that it has become a fire hazard. We are literally sitting elbow to elbow with the other patrons. Our waiter came to get our drink order after about 5 minutes of us being seated, which is average I guess. We know the service is always good at Ruth Chris but we could care less. We were looking forward to the STEAK. Well, we placed our main course order. We both went for the ""sur and turf"". Which was lobster and ribeye or filet. I had the filet and my wife had the ribeye. This is where our experience went south. Our steaks arrived at the table on a sizzling plate as usual. My wife asked for her steak to be cooked medium. I asked for mines to be cooked medium well. Our steaks were overcooked. So overcooked they were tough and inedible. My wife literally left three quarters of the steak on the plate. Yes we could have most likely send them back but thats not something we usually do. This is definitely telling in a restaurant where most patrons come for the steak. The filet was like a small hockey puck. It was almost like it was meant for a little kid. (wish I knew). Our waiter was very good though so didn't blame him for the food. We went ahead and left him a $30 tip on a $185 bill. Oh, we did get a complimentary dessert since it was our anniversary.

I always start with the wedge with bleu cheese. I've had the ribeye and the fillet and both are excellent. I prefer the deeper flavor of the ribeye, but their fillet is really top-notch for a lean cut. In fact, their fillet is more flavorful than any cut of steak you'll find almost anywhere else.

This Ruth's Chris location is bigger and nicer than the one on LI. We had a very nice server named Jamie that made the night pleasant and the service was spot on. The first course was great. We had 4 appatizers-shrimp cocktail (2), caesar salad (1), BBQ shrimp (1).  All appetizers were excellent.  My wife and I had 2 glasses of merlot with dinner and my nephew had 1 beer (bottle). For dinner we had 3 filet's and my younger son and I split a porterhouse for 2. The filets were all excellent I would suggest not getting the porter house as I was expecting a porterhouse like I get a Peter Lugars but was disappointed because the strip side had too many of those white tough uncuttable connective tissues that ruined the experience for me. The filet side was perfect.  When Jamie came by to check on us i pointed out the fact that i needed to be a surgeon to eat the strip side  he leaned over and said thst it looks like just one piece   I managed to get around it but it was not what i expected  For sides we got mashed potatoes. These are great but swimming in butter. Tasted great but if I knew they would be so doused with butter I would have gone for a baked. The asparagus was done perfectly and the creamed spinach excellent. For dessert we all split 1 chocolate lava cake ala mode and one American cheese cake. In retrospect I would have order something else instead of the cheese cake. To me NY cheese cake should be firm and this was not, it was also overly sweet. The chocolate cake was everything you would expect. We passed or coffee and got our check. The total before tip was $357.00 and other than the porter house issue the food was great.

Take it or leave it. :)This place has the best sushi in Nashville. Hands down.Since I live around Nashwood (that line where Nashville and Brentwood meet), I don't feel the need to venture all the way out to Downtown or Brentwood (lazy!) to get my sushi fix. Gas ain't cheap yo and public transportation is a complete joke around these parts of town. So it's kind of hard to find a good sushi spot. Peter's is always busy, Hanabi...just no, Miyako..still need to hit that place up, Sushi O Sushi..it's been awhile I need to check it out again, Samurai...Wild Wasabi..Sam's..and Rusans are a little out of the way. However, Sushi Me changed all of that. It also didn't hurt that it's about 12 minutes away.I remembered the first time that I went with my friend. Our stomachs were famished after walking around shopping and catching up making fun of the folks we had the complete misfortune of going to high school with. We played this typical convo game that's probably all too familiar with your friends and family talking in circles if you don't have an strong opinion of where to go:Me: So, where do you wanna eat?Friend: I dunno. Where ever you wanna go is fine by me.Me: I dunno, sushi?Friend: Ok.Me: Do you wanna try out Sushi O Sushi or Sushi Me?Friend: Doesn't matter, let's get some!Me: But where? We can't be in two places at once!Friend: Haha, I'm hungry..just anything!(went on for a few more minutes until we settled on Sushi Me)Yeah, the longer we talked, the more we starved ourselves. Smdh first world problems.When you step inside, you get a modern Asian vibe with all the red, white, and black. Classy, but still casual. A full bar is there if you want your alcohol fix with a TV for sports watching.We were seated at a table and were completely overwhelmed by the sushi menu with pictures. Indecisiveness of several choices doesn't suit well with me, especially if I want to order the whole menu...which is my dream goal. Someday, it'll happen!Service was good. Maybe we always got lucky with the service? The waitress did her job by promptly checking if we're doing okay and refilled our waters.When the waitress brought out our sushi, we were like, ""OMGGGG SO PRETTY!"" That we didn't want to eat it, but it must be consumed. My friend and I sampled each other's rolls and LOVED every single bite.You won't be disappointed. In presentation and taste, this joint takes the cake..more than Rihanna could ever say! I had the Big Daddy, Angry Banana, Dynamite, Cabo Wabo, Playboy, Green Dragon, Love Me, Mango Tango, Black Dragon, Vampire, and Lenox on my various repeat visits. I bet the other rolls are as great too. Price ranges from $9-15.Main thing here: I'm talking about ordering off the sushi roll signature menu! If the entrees aren't up to your standards...try their sushi. PLEASE IT'S SOOOOOOO WONDERFULLY DELICIOUS! I cannot express that enough.If you don't like sushi, then you need to try it FRIED. Period.

I feel that this 'plan' to develop this place was very well thought. Roll Report: Fireball Roll -  A massive roll, with massive pieces that was recommended by server. Our fav! Baja roll- Simple (in compared to others) but the jalapeno and cilantro gave it a kick! Angry Banana Roll - Yes, you're reading that right, toasted bananas, whipcream, strawberry sauce and crab. Gross? wrong! Very dessert like. I Make sure you're a big fan of bananas (i am not) because its very very bananay. They suggested this be eaten last as a 'dessert' It's a sorta behind Lenox Village next to a big undeveloped field so its sorta tricky. They do not take American Express, but to take Visa and Mastercard.  Prices: Specialty rolls are anywhere from $8.95-$11.95.",Sushime,6153311819,280.0,2011-05-11,"Nashville, TN",/biz/sushime-nashville,4.0,87,"Nashville, TN",Stefanie P.,36.1622296,-86.774353,36.1622296,-86.774353,0.0,True,1130.0
"6900 Lenox Village DrNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"I came to Sushime with a group girls. One of the girls in the group had eaten here before and really enjoyed it. This was a great spot for a girl's night dinner. We were sat at a long, almost secluded table. They easily dealt with the separate orders. The food did come out a bit piecemeal, which for a group is a tad awkward. I am more of a sushi purist so I wasn't expecting to be amazed by the food. I wasn't amazed. I ordered some pretty basic rolls: tuna, spicy tuna, and yellow tail. I also ordered an order of salmon sashimi. My sushi wasn't bad. It was definitely better than the kind that you can find at the grocery store. If I lived in Lenox Village, I wouldn't mind eating here in a pinch. However, I wouldn't drive out of my way to eat their rolls again. The other girls each ordered two or three rolls and then shared them amongst themselves. They ordered the fancy rolls for the most part. They seemed to enjoy most of the rolls. There was only one or two that lay partially consumed at the end of the meal. They had a really awesome drink special when I visited on a Saturday night: $1 hot sake. I would come back for that deal, seriously one dollar.Our waiter was totally overworked. He brought our checks and had our credit cards long enough for us to notice: probably fifteen or twenty minutes. He wouldn't visit our table for awhile but I saw him running around like a mad man. The other girls thought he was rude. He rushed the salmon for me because I didn't order enough food, so I was a bit more grateful.

The first time I visited this restaurant the sushi was impressive. I made the mistake of trying the Pho, and as my auntie says, ""I just haven't learned to appreciate it yet"". The last time I visited, the sushi was again on par. I had the Love Me roll, and the Firecracker, I believe. My wife tried the Las Vegas, and the Cabo Wabo. The Las Vegas was the clear winner that night. The first visit, customer service was adequate and accommodating. Last time, not so much.

"6900 Lenox Village DrNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"I think when you go to a restaurant - the experience is often colored by the ambiance, the table you get, the service you receive and the food you eat.  Sometimes, if most everything is good you can overlook some of the other things that is not so good.So, tonight (a Wednesday Night) we had a group of 7 of us meet for dinner at 7pm.  Most of us, including myself, had never been here.  Three of my friends were already seated when I arrived.  I found that we were seated at a table for 4.  They basically crammed three people on the booth side, they added another chair to the other side of the table where the chairs were and then another one at the end of the table.  It wasn't busy.  There were plenty of other tables.  I'm not sure why they couldn't have pulled up another table to seat us more comfortably...?They took our drink order and it took 15-20 minutes before we actually got our drinks.  I guess 4 sodas and 3 waters takes that long.Appetizers were finally ordered after drinks were delivered and they come about about 10-15 minutes later.  At this point, we have been seated at this incredibly uncomfortable table for about 30-40 minutes and we still haven't been able to order our meals yet.Finally we order our meals - and about 20 minutes later - the food starts to come out   They bring out salads and soups.  Except only 1 person got the soup - and everyone else got salads.  They brought more soups than needed so they just left it at our table and told someone to eat it if they wanted.  The salad was nothing but iceberg lettuce with it drowned in some dressing.  And I mean LITERALLY drowning it this dressing.  There was so much in my bowl it filled up half the bowl with dressing.  Finally - the entrees start to come out...Except - they didn't have ANY of the sushi ready.  So, half the people who ordered 'non' sushi stuff had their food.  The other half didn't.  We were trying to wait for our friends who had ordered sushi...but we kept waiting and waiting - and finally, our friends told us to start without them since our food was hot.  Their food comes out - finally - after most of us were finished with our meal.  They STILL didn't have all the sushi out yet, though.  It was going to be a few more minutes before they could finally have all the sushi.  The opinion of everyone that had the sushi thought it was pretty fresh and tasted pretty good.  However, I got their 'Tempura Dinner' - which is supposed to consist on tempura chicken and vegetables and a warm tempura dipping sauce.  The tempura chicken was nothing more than chicken strips and was very, very bland.  The dipping sauce wasn't included when they brought out my meal so I had to ask for it which basically tasted like watered down soy sauce and it, too, was bland.  It was quite possibly the worst meal I've had all year at a restaurant.  It wasn't that it tasted BAD - it was that it didn't have a taste at all. So, to review:Service was slowThe table was crampedThe salad was badThe entree was blandThe food didn't come out together which is never ideal - leaving others to eat (and finish) before others got their entree.  Had to ask for things that supposedly came with the mealAll in all - I wasn't impressed.  Not with the food.  Not with the service.  Not with the cramped table.  The ambiance was the only thing that was good for me here tonight.  I could have dealt with the cramped table if the service was fast and the food was good - but it wasn't.  Needless to say - SushiMe might be for you - but not for me.  I won't be back.",Sushime,6153311819,86.0,2011-08-10,"Nashville, TN",/biz/sushime-nashville,2.0,87,"Nashville, TN",Joshua B.,36.1622296,-86.774353,36.1622296,-86.774353,0.0,True,3583.0

Some bread was dropped at the table but we let her know we couldn't eat it so she could give it to another table. The friend (who has Celiac's) found a pasta that looked good on the gluten-free menu but was concerned that the bacon might be the same they use in all the other dishes, in which case it probably wasn't gluten-free. She made it a point to ask the server and was assured ""We can't put it on the gluten-free menu unless it's totally gluten-free.""The food comes out fairly quickly. My roommate had the Absolut pasta which was good. I had the Seared Ahi Tuna Salad and asked to take off the crunchy noodles and glazed pecans and substitute avocado but was told she would have to do a charge on the avocado and couldn't substitute it for anything (that's a silly rule). The tuna steak was delicious but there was hardly any avocado on there. It was the equivalent of one slice. I finish my salad pretty quickly and set it off to the side. And it sat there. And sat there. And sat there. As did an empty drink glass and empty water glasses. The waiter had stopped by quickly to check if everything came out okay shortly after the food was dropped at the table and then we didn't see her again until it was about 7:20 (the movie started at 7:30). We asked for a to-go box and the checks. She walks by the table 4 times without either of those and as far as we could see there was only one other table she was dealing with and not many in the restaurant period. She finally comes over with a to-go box but no checks and at that point we had ate enough to make it pointless to take it with. She passed by a few more times with no checks. Finally someone else notices us and asks if we're ok. We ask for the checks, he says he's going to go get the manager. Never see a manager but our server finally comes by and drops the check. We immediately put our payments in the check-holders and prop them up on the corner of the table. She walks directly by them multiple times. The other guy finally came by and noticed we had the checks and I had to ask him to run them for us. He says he can't handle the cash and walks off to get our server. Drinks were overpriced imo. They charged $2.00 for that one slice of avocado. I was finished with my food around 7:10 yet we didn't end up leaving the restaurant until 7:40 due to waiting on checks and paying.

My friend has Celiacs, an auto-immune disease, and the reason why the no gluten is do important. I got a salad which was fine, but the grilled shrimp on top was cold. I ate mine because I was starving. My sister just asked for her pizza to go back in the oven, didn't request a new one all together & my friend asked for hot ff without the bread crumbles. The manager was very nice & fixed all of this. Then said she would be happy to buy us a dessert, which we thought was kind, but we never ordered one because there was a hair in my friends food! Not just a long human hair, short, kinky, rough, reddish colored hair. I'm praying it was from a beard- need I say more! Our server was pretty much nonexistent through the entire ordeal. However she did make a comment about the food looking ""dead"" in the window. For those of you not in this industry- this means the food had been sitting there a very long time! Why on earth would you serve it if this is what you thought?!! I'm sure it was dead- we had been sitting there 1.5hrs! Two hours into the meal when the hair was found we flagged down the manager again. She apologized immensely & said the GM would be out to talk to us shortly. He never showed up. Irritated, disgusted & completely annoyed we left enough money on the table to pay for the bottle of wine, the 1 individual glass my sister had to begin with & my salad. Probably a little extra too, but not much. Then we got up & left. Never in my life have I had to do this. I've been a bartender for over a decade & was a server in my parents restaurant prior to that. I will NEVER go back. This place seriously needs to get it together & a part of me feels like we should've walked out without paying all together, but couldn't because we are honest & weren't just trying to get a free meal.

"1803 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"This place was a perfectly amenable sports bar. We actually ended up going two days in a row because it was one of the closest sports bars to where we were staying showing the NBA Playoffs that had a patio. It's 72 and sunny - don't stick me inside a dark and dingy bar! For shame, sir. For shame. So we went on Monday evening after a failed attempt at a shopping trip since all the shopping places close at 6 (lame). But thankfully made it in time for happy hour. I know this is a Nashville-wide thing, but the 2-for-1 beer deals still blew my mind. It's insane! How do they make any money? So while the atmosphere was exactly what we were looking for, the food was a bit...lacking. Actually, I take that back. The BF ordered chili, which was really actually good, despite the fact it had beans, but we're not in Texas so I'll give them a pass on that one. But we also ordered chicken strips tossed in wing sauce, and they were kind of a giant disappointment. I will say, it's not technically on the menu, so we have to put some of the blame on ourselves, but still. The breading was completely falling off and the sauce, while it had a decent kick was kind of...Asian-inspired? I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but it just wasn't great. We ended up leaving most of them untouched. So the next day we returned, mainly because our waitress informed us that Tuesday was all-day 2-for-1s (again...how do you make money?!), and there was another game on so we headed back because we figured we'd just eat before, and you can't go wrong with beer, a patio, and big TVs.This night was actually kind of funny, we ended up getting there super early (I was NOT missing shopping again people) and I think ran into a Match.com happy hour or something? Whatever it was, it was great people watching, and it was all clear before the game started. We also did the trivia thing they do on Tuesdays, 'cause we're nerds, and totally lost. But no matter.

"1803 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"It is only fitting to start my coverage of Nashville's most memorable places with the one I've spent more time in than my own home: Sam's Sports Grill  in Hillsboro Village. If you're looking for a thrifty, casual happy hour or the perfect spot to watch the game, Sam's is your place.My love affair with Sam's began when visiting my Vandy friends in college, and its solid, dependable, delicious food is what has kept me coming back. Sam's menu features exactly the kind of food you'd expect from a sports bar - wings, pizza, sandwiches and salads - but the thing that makes this place special is that it does these things extremely well. For example, when I told my friend Carson Popkin, 28, that I was writing this post she just said ""Wiiiiiings..."" and stared off hungrily into the distance before coming to and saying, ""They're phenomenal.""But wings are not the only thing Sam's is doing right. The Cajun Pepperoni Pizza is a salty, crispy pie with just the right spicy kick, and the Campfire Chili with cheese and onions is simply one of the best bowls of chili I have ever had. And I've had some chili. When soup and chili cheese dogs make up 80% of your diet, you become an expert fast. In short, the food is straight-forward, fresh and very well-executed. Whether you need to grab a club and fries for lunch or cure your hangover with a Blue Moon and a burger, Sam's will do you right.And that is in no small part due to the atmosphere. Sam's is a quintessential sports bar with happy hour from 3-7 every weekday except Tuesday (when it's two-for-one!) and at least 20 TVs broadcasting games at all times. (It is a smoking establishment, so take that into consideration before you pull up a stool.) On any given Saturday there are 100+ sports fans screaming their guts out for their teams, and the wait staff generally does an good job keeping pace with the thirsty legions. It's even better when the weather is nice and they roll up the garage doors on the front side. Breeze + good people watching is the ultimate relaxation-maker.Sam's also has a lively game of trivia on Wednesdays and even livelier karaoke night on Fridays. In short, Sam's is my Cheers (and ironically, Sam was the guy who ran Cheers - coincidence? I think not). I'd suggest that you make it yours too... Except overcrowding would make my standard Saturday table even harder to come by, and we clearly can't have that. But what the hey, go visit them anyway. In no time at all, it'll be the place where everybody knows your name.1803 21st Avenue SouthNashville, TN 37212(615) 383-3601Sam's also has a second location in Hendersonville, so you suburbanites don't have to miss out on the fun.",Sam’s Sports Bar and Grill,6153833601,3.0,2011-03-09,"Nashville, TN",/biz/sams-sports-bar-and-grill-nashville,5.0,124,"Nashville, TN",Ashley B.,36.1622296,-86.774353,36.1622296,-86.774353,0.0,True,2672.0

I'm afraid hearing someone crying over having to get their freakin' brand new car washed twice made me want to throttle some people.  The sports crowd has generally been a nice group when I've been there.  During the day time you can usually catch a more rugged crew... that's the only time I've had a bar patron tell me what to do with my life at Sam's without any word spoken by me.Restrooms - go from OK to ""I will hold it for the next 3 hours"" quickly.  Generally when the place is d-bag-overrun the mens room needs to be waded into.  I would not wear any non-fluid-tight shoes in there.  If you can fit into the bar though, chances are the bathrooms are at least ok.Larger groups, this place is probably not for you if you want to sit at one table.  A group I was with had 12 people and we managed to sort of hold down an area, but we usually had 2-3 people up.All in all, I like the place.  Their pizza is not the best, but it's still about as good the next couple of days.  It's definitely something to check out.  Parking can be a mess if anything's going on, and the lot is generally patrolled by someone looking for a handout when the crowd is bumping.One thing to note, if you're on a motorcycle, your gear is not safe.  Sam's and Boscos are evidently frequented by drunken kleptomaniacs.  I've had gloves stolen (was doing a Christmas eve ride, so I got to ride home with no gloves in 36 degrees) have seen and stopped someone trying to pick up someone's helmet and have heard tale of completely non-valuable things stolen by drunk people out of open cars.  So if you're a biker, do the uncool thing and take your gear in with you.  If you're a car owner lock everything / keep stuff out of site.  It's not the homeless who wander the area that are stealing, it's drunken college students.",Sam’s Sports Bar and Grill,6153833601,573.0,2010-10-21,"Nashville, TN",/biz/sams-sports-bar-and-grill-nashville,3.0,124,"Nashville, TN",Paul K.,36.1622296,-86.774353,36.1622296,-86.774353,0.0,True,3605.0

I ordered a Sierra Nevada and it came out flat and warm. My friend ordered a Yazoo Pale Ale and received a cloudy, orange colored, spicy smelling blue moon. We sent them back and ordered Sweetwater 420 instead. They where also flat and warm.The manager said their must be a problem with the draft system and offered us bottled beer instead. I ordered my standard choice of Sam Adams figuring it was a safe bet.He returned  with a brown bottle with NO LABEL and quickly put it on the table without saying anything or apologizing and walked away. When I took a sip it was one of the same flat warm beers that came out of the draft, I couldn't quite identify it, but it wasn't Sam Adams.

Okay, back to the shiny happy stuff! Sam's is a kick ass sports bar. Not only do they have a great selection of tap/beer bottles, the bartenders are very skilled with the cocktails (even delicious coffee based hot drinks in the winter). Even better than the booze is the food. CHICKEN TENDERS. I'm not kidding, these are the best in town. Perfectly crunchy, beer-battered pieces of heaven! I love getting the traditional wing sauce along w/ ranch or bleu cheese for dipping. You can get them tossed in the wing sauce, but that tends to kill the crunch. Another star are the wings. Even if you think ""Extra Hot"" might be too much, just try it. I'm usually a strict medium - weak hot when it comes to spicy foods, but they smelled so good I had to steal one from my boyfriends plate. They aren't on the menu, but they will gladly add some extra heat to the usual hot for you. Other standouts include the rib appetizer, beer battered onion rings, cheeseburger and (when they have it) the creamy chicken artichoke soup.

There seemed to be some arguing amongst the staff, maybe due to the shortages. Also, the trash was overflowing and needed to be taken out. I didn't hold any of this against them because stuff happens. On my second trip, similar story. They were out of carnitas again (won't hold it against them because I think it's a national thing) but also completely out of hot salsa, black beans, a couple of others, as I went through the line. It was a matter of asking the kitchen for more to replace an empty bin. At all the other Chipotles I've been to they're pretty seamless. Line staff notices they're nearly out of black beans, they shout to the back for some more, and pour the new batch into the existing bin. This location wasn't doing that at all. They were scrapping the bottom of the hot salsa bin, giving me half a serving and calling it good.Also, this location is pretty dirty. A lot of unbussed tables, low supply of Tabasco sauces out.

"2825 W End AveNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"You know about Chipotle. They make burritos. So why review it?Because there are two things I want you to know:1. Yes, the guacamole is pricey, but it's free if you get a veggie burrito. They don't publicize this, and you have to ask for it at the end.2. On a per-calorie basis, this is one of the cheapest, most delicious ""real food"" restaurant lunches you can get. I am of course not counting traditional fast food in this equation. For around $7 for a burrito, you get roughly 1000 calories (more if you get cheese and sour cream). For some people, you can make two meals out of that. I can't, but it's still a good deal.The biggest problem with Chipotle is salt.

And not just one, but multiple Chipotles to feed my hunger for delicious burritos.If you have never tasted a Chipotle burrito before, for whatever crazy reason that has kept you from it--maybe the whole ""chain restaurant"" thing scared you off, you need to try one. All of the components of this delicious masterpiece are incredible, starting with the ever critical cilantro-lime rice. Yes, the most amazing and fragrant herb on the planet has been paired with the most delicious citrus accent to create the perfect base and marinade for the rice.  Then you can add either beans or peppers/onions (for a fajita burrito) and the meat. I always go for the chargrilled chicken--yum! Toss on that fresh pico de gallo and maybe some of the spicier salsas and some cheese and sour cream and lettuce and wrap it in a warm tortilla or spoon it up in a bowl for a lower-carb and lower-calorie option. I prefer the burrito bowl option because otherwise the burrito tends to just get quartered-off and since no one can ACTUALLY fit the whole burrito in their mouth, you only get half of the ingredients--it doesn't mix well. Usually they'll let you get the tortilla on the side if you want it still to eat it with your burrito bowl too.Also, their guacamole is fantastic.

"2825 W End AveNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"I won't lie: the only reason I set foot in Chipotle was because I received a ""buy one, get one free"" coupon and figured that was enough of an incentive to give the place a try. Don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against the place, but despite living within spitting distance of the place (yum?), I'd never frequented it simply because I don't really do fast food.I guess the obvious comparison to make is between this and Qdoba (where I admit that I have eaten MANY times in the past). I think that for the money, Chipotle is the better pick simply because the ingredients seem fresher, which is probably reflected in the relatively slimmer menu at Chipotle. Rather than overwhelming you with myriad options, you pretty much decide whether you want a burrito, a burrito bowl, tacos (soft or hard), salad, or tacos. The filling choices are the same for all of them (chicken, steak, barbacoa, carnitas, or veggies) and everything costs about $6.25. It seems like Chipotle has decided to focus on providing the best product possible, so while eating here every day would probably get boring, what you do get tastes pretty good. Also, the portions are HUGE. A single burrito will probably get you through the day because the amount they manage to cram into a flour tortilla (how do they do it?!?) is enough to feed a small family... or the average American, I suppose.The first time I came, I got the carnitas burrito, which was sufficiently good that my husband and I decided to come back. I think the barbacoa burrito is probably my favorite - the meat is juicy and nicely spiced. We both splurged and got guac on our burritos, and while $1.25 for this add in (the only one you have to pay for) may seem pricey, it was well worth it because this guacamole is muy delicioso. That said, if not for the coupon we had, two burritos and one drink would have cost us nearly $19... which seems kind of insanely expensive for fast food in my mind. Sure this is a healthier choice than a lot of other places, but for $20 there are a lot of other (non-fast food) places I'd hit up first before coming back here.

Here's why.I ordered the Combo Plate (chopped beef brisket, pulled pork, turkey, bologna, sausage; $7.99 with two sides). Grab a tray, the meat is served to you with sauce poured over the top, and then you serve your own vegetables. The portion size was just fine (picture is uploaded). The sausage was by far the most flavorful meat on my plate, but like the previous commenter said, probably not made in-house. The turkey was a little dry and the beef and pork were average to bland.Sides (macaroni, green beans, texas toast) were a bummer. Some generous salt on the green beans helped, and the macaroni was fine (can't really screw up macaroni). The toast was room-temperature.However, here's the dealbreaker: the BBQ sauce was ... inexplicable. Watery and bland, without a hint of spiciness or seasoning.

The burritos are mission style which means they are massive. They have all the standard meats, vegetarian options, and toppings that you find at most mission style shops so you can customize your burrito however you see fit. For the calorie conscious they offer naked burritos in a bowl which is always a plus for me.If burritos aren't you thing they have quite a few other options like Mexican gumbo, tortilla soup, tacos, quesadillas, and a host of other standard tex-mex type fare. Other noteworthy items - I like the fact that they have a rewards program via the Qdoba card and every 10th meal is free. I'm also a fan of the habanero salsa. It noticeably hotter than what you find at the other local chains. All in all this is a solid option for a quick burrito.

But in the interest of fairness, I'll list the specific reasons why Qdoba sucks, rather than simply ranting about the philosophical reasons not to eat there.1) Their burritos are bland. This is because their meat is bland. They have no flavor profile, because their flavors come in packets from national HQ. Their salsas are also quite bland.2) I'm sorry Nashville, consumption of queso sauce is acceptable only on nachos at sporting events and on occasions of extreme drunkenness. In my burrito, never.3) Their employees need to learn to roll. They just slop the ingredients onto the tortilla in a big mound without even a not to rough linearity (is that a word?). Then, they carelessly schlump (that's right, schlump) it all into an amorphous softball-like blob that quickly seeps through its wrapper and makes you devolve into taking a spoon to its bland, mushy innards.4) Nine bucks for a burrito and a drink!?

I'll explain why:First...When we walked in, we were not greater with a smile and welcomed. We were merely asked how many and seated in the far back corner of the restaurant as opposed to the best available. After we were seated, it took over 10 minutes for our server to even get to our table and take our drink order, which then took her another 10 minutes to bring to us, then another 10 minutes to return for our order. This pattern continued throughout our visit. She had no customer service etiquette at all, which seemed to be a trend throughout the employees. A manager never approached us to ask how our experience or food was. And when we checked out, the young lady at the front just chewed her gum, barely acknowledged us, ran my card and handed my receipt. No ""How was everything?"", no ""Hello"", no ""thank you""....not ONE word. This was after we stood there approximately 5 minutes while she was doing something on a piece of paper before she put her hand out for our check. Secondly, when the plates and utensils were brought to our table, they were soaking wet. No one had taken the time to dry them of before bringing them out. Not one employee in the restaurant was smiling. Our food was cold when we FINALLY got it. The gift shop area looked just sad, like there was no attempt to make it look neat, stocked or sell-worthy and they outside (which has SO much potential) looked like it hadn't been maintained in years and appeared very dull. The whole atmosphere was very bland.Honestly, I only give two stars because I have so much hope for this place. My first time here I was thoroughly impressed. And if it was not for the amazing food and good prices, I would not have rated it as high as I did.

Service is friendly, but accident prone. Ambience is bland and boring.I will probably never go back. There are too many awesome restaurants in Nashville to waste time with this place. I was also disappointed that the wait staff was not dressed in silly costumes as other Yelpers have suggested.

Sister-in-law found this place while searching on line. We went for dinner and were seated in a semiprivate room at a long table made up of four tables pushed together. Menu is limited and all meals served family style, which include coleslaw, fries, hush puppies, marinated onions & skillet bread. Our waiter seemed harried. He took our orders and once the food started arriving, we found more than one discrepancy. When he brought out the skillet bread, (uniquely served in cast iron mini skillets), he proceeded to show how to flip it in mid air, which instantly fell on the floor, instead of the pan where it belonged. Their signature item is 'fried catfish fillets' which was very good. ($11.95) Children's menu has catfish, and chicken ($6.50) or shrimp (6.95) This is a unique 'theme' type restaurant. Plates are gold pans and cups are tin. Lighting is very dim and with a dark menu, hard to see. Waiters are in period dress. Lots of rocking chairs in the foyer to sit in while you wait to get a table. The ambiance was nice, with added treat of looking out the window at the firefly's flitting by. I would suggest that they put more than one person with such a big group. Our server definitely needed some help. We had to ask more than once for refills on water & sweet tea.

Last week, we were in the area looking for rental houses (!!!!, not khan's related, but hell yes) and we swung by to try some sweets. We were with vegan friends who love this place and advised us that the wait for other food would be too long. We decided on the pumpkin cupcake with cream ""cheez"" and the ""cheezcake"" brownie. The brownie was pretty good. Super thick so I took one bite and that was enough for me because I don't have a huge sweet tooth. I didn't taste any cheezcake even though the one bite involved a piece of the cheezcake swirl. Still a good tasting brownie. I liked the cupcake as a whole just alright. The frosting wasn't that great to me. There was more spice in it than the cream cheese flavor. I was vegan for a short while so I know what to expect from vegan cream cheese. I just had higher expectations for the frosting from a vegan bakery. However, I did like the cupcake itself and I ate it all. Fast forward two days (yes, only two days). We were driving around aimlessly looking for rent signs again and we decided to stop for lunch. This round we didn't get any baked goods. I chose the special of the day: the bless your heart wrap. It was a whole wheat wrap filled with crispy ""chicken,"" mac & cheez, collard greens, and sweet potatoes with a side of potato salad. Per my suggestion, my husband chose the surly bird. I've heard it's awesome and he almost ordered the same thing i did. I wanted to try two different things and sharing food is one of the perks (and disadvantages) of being married!

"733 Porter RdNashville, TN 37206",4.5,"I'm a meat eater. I don't hide it and I'm not ashamed. But during a time in college and after I was vegetarian and vegan (until someone dangled bacon in front of my face at a diner). I can appreciated solid vegan food and I really enjoy the stuff on occasion. I have had a few cakes from Khan's before they opened their retail bakery at The Wild Cow but until a few weeks ago I have never gone inside their storefront on Porter Road.Khan's is very small. There are room for about 3 two-top tables, the bakery counter and that is it.  The decor screams ""hippy-vegan-cafe"" which is neither a good nor bad thing. It is just a fact. Steve and I went in for lunch and beside one gentleman finishing his sandwich and another waiting on a smoothie the place was empty. And even though the place was empty, it did feel that we waited a very long time for something as simple as a sandwich.I ordered the special which was the ""Kale Me Crazy."" It contained fake crispy chicken, baby kale, carrots, artichoke hearts, cucumbers and a mint tahini dressing. I honestly wasn't a big fan of this dish. It was about 80% kale and since the chicken was the first ingredient listed I was expecting more chicken than I received. The mint tahini sauce was great, but I felt that something was just keeping this dish back from being a great wrap.  It did come with a side of potato salad that was SO GOOD. I would have never guessed that it was vegan. That potato salad seriously blew my mind.I will say that I was at Khan's a week before and ordered the Cactus Burrito (seitan chorizo, black beans, cactus, poblano peppers, avocado salsa, mixed greens and cashew cheese in a whole wheat wrap) and I really loved that thing.  My only issue with that burrito was that I wanted it to have way more cactus. I love cactus and so few places showcase what it can do.Steve ordered the Surly Bird which had the same crispy fake chicken as my wrap, but his sandwich had a whole cutlet of it. The Surly Bird also had fake cheddar cheese, arugula, tomato, red onions, chipotle agave mustard all grilled on naturally leavened whole wheat focaccia. His sandwich was the clear winner. I was surprised by how much I loved the grilled bread and the fake cheddar cheese. Plus in this sandwich you can taste just how good the crispy fake chicken is.Since Khan's is a bakery we couldn't leave without having something sweet. We went for the chocolate chip whoopie pie. This was the fanciest (and maybe healthiest) little Debbie snack cake. The cookies were very soft and had a great chip to batter ratio.  The cream in the center was very light and fluffy and not overly sweet like some sugar frosting tends to be.I should also mention that on Valentine's Day I went to Khan's to get a sweet strawberry chocolate cupcake for Steve. He liked it so much he didn't even let me have a bite!While Khan's sandwiches have been hit or miss for me (and trust me the hits are WORTH it) I can honestly say that this is the best vegan bakery I have ever been to. The sweets are just so darn good that you can buy them for your next get together, not tell anyone that they're vegan, and no one will be able to guess. So if anyone wants to get me a cake my favorite is the Elvis cake (banana cake with peanut butter frosting).",Khan’s Desserts,6159154972,94.0,2014-02-21,"Nashville, TN",/biz/khans-desserts-nashville,4.0,75,"Nashville, TN",Lauren W.,36.1622296,-86.774353,36.1622296,-86.774353,0.0,True,3274.0

Seriously! That made the wait totally worth it!   The coffees were perfect, mine was the light roast and hubs had the dark roast.  But  OH. MY. GOD. - the APPLE FRITTERS!!! Freshly made, still hot, and just as I was telling hubs maybe we should just share one, he had already scarfed his down and said ""sure I'll share yours with you""!  WHAT the ?! I took one bite and realized NO way was I gonna share that bit of heaven with anyone, it was ALL mine!  Soooo freakin' good!  Be careful, cuz if you buy a lot, for later, you'll probably just eat them all right then and die in a happy diabetic coma.We also ordered the Surly BIrd Pannini and the Greenhouse wrap to-go ( for later in the day at a picnic at Arrington Vineyards).  We kept them in an ice chest until we ate them about 5 hours later. Sometimes sandwiches get kinda soggy kept that long, but not these - they kept very well (due to being expertly wrapped in paper, with the pickle wrapped several layers outside the sammies so as not to impart the dreaded pickle sog).  I'd had the Surly Bird before, and it's still one of my favorite sandwiches - served on house-made whole-wheat sourdough focaccia, with yummy crispy ""chicken"" seitan, vegan ""cheddar"", arugula, tomato, roasted onion with a chipotle agave mustard - the combo of all those ingredients on that perfect bread - amazing!

"3798 Nolensville PikeNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"Since I work in the area, I've driven by Los Arcos many times but never stopped. Recently a coworker suggested that we stop there for dinner. Honestly, I was a bit skeptical, but all it took was that first bite to win me over. The food, staff and atmosphere were all excellent, and LA has become a frequent dinner destination for me.Los Arcos' pricing is typical for what I would expect from a Mexican restaurant in that area, but the portions are extremely large and the food is of above average quality. I've tried every variation of enchiladas that they have to offer, and I have nothing but good things to say about them. Their rice isn't as dry as what I typically find in restaurants, and the refried beans are out of this world.If you're craving a little liquid relaxation, the margaritas are reasonably priced and very well made. A couple of their margaritas paired with chips and salsa or queso is a great way to unwind after a long day of work.The only negative that I've really run across with Los Arcos is that special order items seem to take quite a bit longer to be brought to the table than a standard order. While I would expect a slight delay for some special orders, I don't see why something as simple as leaving off the lettuce or tomatoes should add any significant amount of time to the preparation of my food.

I came here for the first time with a friend during the Southern Festival of Books this past weekend. It was a Saturday afternoon, and we learned upon arrival that they were closing in another 10 minutes. We just wanted a piece of cake, which was already prepared and sitting in a glass case. As we were looking at the case deciding on which we wanted, we were stiffly informed ""We're Closed!"" by a gentleman who worked there and that we would not be able to order. Then he turned to the woman working the register (who was in the process of taking a man's order) and told her to continue helping that man, because ""he's a regular."" He proceeded to point us toward the door and made it abundantly clear we weren't welcome even though it was 10'til. Unbelievable. With all the tourists that were in town this weekend for the home game & the book festival, I am baffled that someone would chance dirtying a visitor's experience in our city with that kind of nonsense.Despite how rude we felt this encounter was, I went back the next day to get my cake & a coffee-drink. Because, you know, cake is cake and I have needs. And I've got to tell you, the customer service was lackluster and the cake was at best mediocre. The coffee was so thick and sweet I threw more than half of it away. My boyfriend got a panini, and that was really good, but still--definitely not worth patronizing this business after how I've seen they treat their customers. I work in corporate retail, so maybe I'm overly sensitive to these things, but I very firmly believe that there is absolutely NO excuse whatsoever for poor customer service.

"601 Church StNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"This review covers a range of experiences. I work at the library next to Provence, so this place is kinda the only game in town if I want some coffee at work or don't have time to pack breakfast or lunch. I used to go at least 3x a week to this place. There are some good things about Provence, but unfortunately, most of them are bad. This only applies to the downtown location. I've only been to the Hillsboro village location once.The good: their chocolates, tortes, and sweet things are damn good. Their croissants are stellar, when they don't overcook them. Their bread in general is good. It ought to be. They've won awards for it, apparently. The coffee is pretty good, too, even if Starbucks' is better. Tomato basil soup, shepherd's pie, and pot pie are all tasty and have none of the faults the other hot items have. The sweets case is refrigerated and has a door on it. Nice and clean.The bad: The pastries case does not have a door. I have seen flies all over the contents. The food from the hot case (quiches, paninis, etc) is greasy and lacking in filling. It just doesn't look or taste fresh.The ugly: Beware the open refrigerated case across from the checkout. Every item I have ever purchased has been spoiled. Olive tapenade (With way too much anchovy. And it didn't come with bread.)- spoiled. Orzo salad- spoiled. Couscous salad- spoiled. Tuna salad- spoiled. Greens- wilted, wet and brown at the edges. They make entirely too much food for that cooler. It sits there too long and turns, and then people buy rotten food. That Tuesday sticker on the bottom? It's probably last Tuesday. Also, the coffee grinder is next to the ice machine, and they often leave the lid off the machine. I'm fairly sure that's a health code violation. it also means your ice water will often have coffee grounds in it.The service is abominable. They have no system for handling customers efficiently, so the wait is always at least 10 minutes, even for a simple cappucino. I waited 17 minutes for Ben to heat my panini for 40 seconds. And when I went to my desk and opened my package, it was only half a panini instead of the whole one I ordered. I also discovered I'd been overcharged about $1.50. I went back to dispute it, but now I don't know how many times I've been overcharged in the past.The staff is friendly about half the time, and generally preoccupied the rest of the time. The manager, Ben, is always surly. I don't think I've ever seen him with a definite expression on his face. But I'm not mad about that. I didn't go there for the conversation- I went for food. Didn't get either. I'd love for this place to take a turn for the better, but until then, Starbucks is a block down Church St, and there's a foofoo little sweets bakery half a block up 6th Ave if you can catch them while they're open.

It opens at 7am, I have a 10min grace period before having to officially clock-in, and so it should be a breeze to go into the Provence then hop along into my work. It is not!As stated before, Provence is supposed to open at 7am. The manager usually doesn't get the place opened until 15-20min after that. He moves around like he's made of molasses and smells like he's just inhaled a chimney worth of smoke, sometimes. When one does go in to order the customer is either met with warmth and friendliness, or the customer doesn't exist at all. It's not uncommon for one to see three bodies roaming around behind the counter without so much as a glance at the people waiting in line. I once asked a person going before me had she been waited on, and she said, ""No."" This was shocking because she and I were the first two in line!Apparently, they were just getting ready for the lunch crowd and hadn't pulled everything out yet. This wouldn't have been a problem if it wasn't for the fact that this location does this constantly! I've actually had semi-cooked food delivered to me because one of the guys hadn't put the food in at an appropriate time, therefore it wasn't ready by the time the lunch rush. That, of course, didn't stop them from serving it and charging $10. So, I received bland half-cooked food that I could've made better at home for less cost. One also has to pay extra for drinks, like with most places. However, one can't get free or reduced price refills, unless it's coffee.The only reason this place is getting two stars is because some of the staff are great, and the pastries are decent.

I ordered the bbq shrimp to start, and it was probably the best dish of the night. Then I had the sliced filet mignon. It was really overcooked (I asked for medium). The risotto underneath got a crusty top to it, I think it was sitting out in the back for too long. Wine was great, but the food was just such a disappointment.

Especially considering that a place like this should have top notch service. Sat at the bar and it took 5 minutes after I ordered my beer to receive it, the person I was with ordered a cocktail and was told 5 minutes AFTER I received my beer that they did not have the puree to make it. This would normally be fine except for the fact that it took the bartender 10 minutes to make her aware of that fact. Ordered a different cocktail and all was fine. The dessert donuts we ordered were blah. Just overpriced donut holes with nothing remotely special about them. I ordered a prime burger cooked medium. It was definitely cooked well done so I asked for some mustard to attempt to make the burger not so dry. I kid you not it took at least 10 minutes to get my mustard..... Just a ridiculous amount of time for something so simple. Also the only time I was asked about my food all night was immediately after it was brought out ""does everything look good?"" I was never asked about it again you know the point where they ask ""does everything taste ok?"" Well I was never asked anything like that so.....Also my friends iPhone was spilled on by our bartender and he just stood there without saying anything for 30 seconds and then he finally tried to wipe it off and said ""I'm sorry"". We didn't receive any type of accommodation for this. I would expect at least a few dollars off the total bill but alas nothing was removed or discounted.I was a bartender at an upscale restaurant like this with $30-$40 plates for 2+ years so even though I may be young I know what service is to be expected.

"2525 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"Flemings, for a chain, should have stronger training and QC practices amongst it's many locations. This location was particularly disappointing to our group of 11, who have visited the likes of McCormick & Schmicks, Ruth's Chris, and Smith & Wollensky in the last few months. Even compared to my last Flemings visit in Phoenix, this place was more like a Chili's than a high-end steakhouse. What was the problem? A mediocre wait staff, a slow kitchen, a disorganized FOTH, and hostesses with attitude. On a half-full Thursday night house, timing was off, courtesy and respect were forgotten, and basic hygiene was ignored. Could I be oversensitive? Maybe. But for $50 a steak, I expect the following: - prompt, courteous greeting upon entry and after the announcement of our reservation - a hostess that, when seating our group, ensures everyone's comfort and courteously speaks to all members of the group - a server/waiter that presents himself professionally, speaks clearly and enunciates, and uses speech that is appropriate for the classy environment in which he serves - a kitchen that understands how to properly time a large group order and prioritize according to the same standard as a small order  - the delivery of our on-menu food order IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR'S WAIT - a bussing or support staff that keeps their fingers off the plates when serving - a server/waiter that ensures each member of a group RECEIVES THE CORRECT ENTREE AND SIDE DISH before disappearing -  a server/waiter that performs a PROPER CHECKBACK!That really sums up the issues. I provided two stars in my review for properly trimming and cooking my steak, and for keeping our wine and water glasses full.

They, unlike their upscale counterparts include cocktails in their happy hour. The cocktails are strong and good. I went to Flemings twice last week. I sat in the bar area both times. Beth and Matt are awesome, knowledgeable bartenders. When I went on Wednesday, I let the bartenders know that I planned to return on Friday with a larger group and I asked if they could assist with the seating. The bartenders said that they would help accommodate us and unlike other restaurants, they remembered and came through for me. That is a huge plus in my book.Now on to the food and cocktails-Wednesday, I orders the Pomtini, which rocks. My sister ordered the Tickled Pink which was advertised as being only 99 calories. I tasted it, and I didn't like the fake sugary taste to it. But I am not a diet or splenda type of girl. I like all of the million calories inside of my cocktails. :-) I ordered the seared ahi tuna and my sister order the Prime burger. The  portions were nice for the price that we paid. Well worth it! The tuna was perfectly cooked and it was served with a spicy mustard sauce. I love spice in my life, so I loved the sauce. The Prime burger was HUGE! It was served with 2 huge onion rings. The burger is the best thing on the apps menu for the price. It will totally help you if you plan to drink several of those $6 cocktails. The next time I go to Flemings I will definitely try the Prime burger. All in all, even when the restaurant got packed with the after work crowd, the service was still excellent. Friday, I ordered another Pomtini to start off with. I ended up switching to the Tropical cocktail. Beth made it will blueberries instead of the cherry which made the flavor even better. I started off with the bar b que shrimp. The shrimp was a nice size, but it was completely different from the New Orleans style bbq shrimp. Although it was different, I loved it. I tried the calamari next. I wasn't as pleased with this dish so I shared to the girls at my table. I didn't like how the calamari was pre-tossed in the sauce instead of having it on the side to dip into. After a while, the calamari had a soggy feel to it. If I was to order it again, I would ask the chef to put the sauce on the side. Again the service from Matt and Beth was wonder.

I don't know why other people have it low reviews-- I would take them with a grain of salt.Everything here was impressive-- from the food to the service, Magnolia South pays special attention to give patrons a good experience. My date and I had the four course tasting menu with wine and it was a wonderful meal. When I made the reservation, I noted that I'm a vegetarian, and the restaurant had no trouble accommodating. I didn't feel like I was missing anything that meat-eaters get-- every course was delicious. We started with a charcuterie board that was phenomenal. In addition to three flavorful cheeses, the board featured several meats, grilled homemade bread, some pickled condiment, pickled vegetables, peach jam, and the most WONDERFUL homemade honey-cranberry butter. Wow-- I could've eaten thai butter on anything! The waitress said it's made daily and the chef is always trying new combinations.After, we had the fried green tomatoes, fresh pasta and marinara (all made in-house!), and finished off with a fresh fruit and vanilla tart and a rich, smooth chocolate buttermilk pudding. We each chose a glass of wine from the menu, and the waiter recommended a red that my date really enjoyed. The water served was a nice touch too-- it was infused with lemon and cucumber and felt like we were at the spa.More than anything, the environment was an enjoyable place to be. The restaurant is located on a quiet street in a beautiful, old building. There are two dining rooms with quaint settings. The restaurant pays attention to the details-- everything is expertly and carefully decorated. The restrooms were spacious and clean.The service was amazing too. Multiple waiters stopped by to explain every dish as it was presented and ensure we had all of our needs taken care of. The waiters were polite and professional-- they didn't hover awkwardly and never rushed us, but they did ensure everything progressed smoothly and in a time-sensitive manner.

To further that honesty, lets be truthful with our selves... when you go to lets say KFC and they ask you what two sides, what are you most inclined to?

Their bulgogi (marinated beef) is also excellent, but a bit on the price-y side.As much as I love the tofu soups, I tend to order the Dolsot Bibimbap more often.  Seriously, every time I go to this restaurant, I tell myself that I'll order the seafood tofu soup but then right when the waitress comes to the table, I will second-guess myself and end up ordering the Dolsot Bibimbap. Why?  Because it is the best of both worlds and possibly the most delicious meal ever.  Dolsot Bibimbap is a traditional Korean dish that basically amounts to a bowl of rice with different toppings and a sweet chili sauce (that you add in to your tasting).  But, the best part is ""Dolsot"" which means a hot stone pot, so just like the sizzling pot the tofu soup is served in, this rice dish is served in a piping hot stone bowl so you cook/fry the rice to your liking.  It is absolutely remarkable and I love that you can add in as much of the chili paste as you want--so if you want it spicier, you can add more.  Most Korean restaurants just end there--but So Gong Dong Tofu House anticipated the torment of deciding between ordering a tofu soup and the Dolsot Bibimbap because every Dolsot Bibimbap is accompanied by a small tofu & mushroom soup!  IT'S THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS! :)As all Korean restaurants do, your meal is also served with complimentary barley tea (iced or hot) and a variety of daily cold side dishes (which you can always ask for more of, although whenever I go with my Korean friends, they sometimes get embarrassed by how many times I want to ask for more of the side dishes!).  The quality of the side dishes are great.  Sometimes they'll give you omelets or even japchae (sweet potato noodles with veggies)!The service isn't spectacular here. Sometimes, you have to wave over the only waitress attending to the tables--but the food is worth the wait and the lack of service.  Yes, it can be slightly pricier when compared to Korea House, but the quality makes up for it.  It's authentic, delicious, hot, and gosh...now that I'm writing this review, I have a burning desire to get in my car and drive over there!",So Gong Dong Tofu House Restaurant,6157812022,310.0,2011-02-13,"San Francisco, CA",/biz/so-gong-dong-tofu-house-restaurant-nashville,5.0,72,"Nashville, TN",Jess Y.,36.1622296,-86.774353,37.7792768,-122.41927040000002,1963.4667482795255,False,2971.0

"1310 Antioch PikeNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"As a huge fan of Korean food, I hate to say that this is the worst Korean restaurant I've been to in Nashville due to some of the worst service I've ever had, overpriced dishes, and small portions.First of all, let's talk about the service. The entire time my friend and I were there, we were given one small cup of water and were never offered a refill. Even worse, our very modestly sized side dishes were not refilled either. In fact, the only time I saw the server was when I received my water and when I got my dish. I understand that service in restaurants in Korea is second to the food, but at least at these restaurants service can be requested by ringing a bell. Sadly, no such method of summoning service exists at So Gong Dong.I could have gotten past the awful service if the food had been incredible, but sadly that just wasn't the case. I ordered one of their combination platters which consisted of a soup plus half order of bulgogi for about $20. Although this would be a ton of food at any other restaurant, I have to say that I was able to eat the soup and the bulgogi all in one sitting and still be a little bit hungry. Clearly, this restaurant is attempting to serve ""upscale"" Korean food, but ultimately this place fails to do even that; the soup and bulgogi were both good but are no better than what I've had at Korea House or Midori.Ultimately, So Gong Dong provides average Korean fare at excessive prices with miserable service.

I have been in there a few times, and they are playing the same tape of a bunch of country music stars sitting around singing songs and talking. It's even got a skinny Vince Gill in it.

"4111 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"We were in Nashville for 4 days and Flip was the only blight on our food journey. I read the reviews and the overall star rating was questionable, but I went ahead, hoping they had improved as some reviews mentioned they had only been open a few months. I wanted to love this place, but instead I was happy to leave and never return.You walk into the restaurant and there is desk where presumably a hostess might be, but isn't. We stood there for about 7 minutes with another group ahead of us. Finally a waitress came by to seat us. Ok, not a great first impression. I don't know why they don't have a dedicated hostess during lunch rush, but alright I could get over that. We ordered the poutine with the gravy on the side because we know chorizo in Arizona, but don't how they prepare it in Nashville, in gravy. It took quite awhile for it to come out, but I get it, they were busy. The gravy was surprisingly good. Sadly, that is where the journey of delight ended. The fries were SOOO salty. I love salt. I have several types and generally over-salt my food. So when I say they were too salty, they were way too salty. We had very little breakfast and were hungry so we kept trying to eat them. The egg was beyond poorly prepared...the whites weren't cooked but the underside of the egg was nearly burnt, with those unappetizing plastic curled edges. The cheese curds never got to the melted gooey stage because the fries were not hot and we had the gravy on the side. Poor execution is an understatement. Another reviewer had mentioned that the fries were overly salted and I am ashamed to say, I assumed they had corrected the dish. Save your money, time and tastebuds and don't order their fries.The sweet potato tots and marshmallow cream were tasty. Easily the best thing we ate. The tots had those almost over-done edges that offset the sweet and provided a great bite with the marshmallow cream. As other reviewers mention, this side is more sweet than savory.So, this is a burger place. Specifically a burger ""boutique"". Hubby and I decided to split a burger so we could have room to try the appetizer and a couple sides. We ordered a classic bacon cheeseburger. To say it was disappointing would be mild. Who looks at this stuff before it comes out? Two strips of bacon sat limply across the burger...I'm talking almost opaque fat here. This was no strip of bacon, this was a bacon noodle that couldn't stick to a wall if it tried. Booooo. If I want to eat congealed fat on my burger, I will order it. I want crispy fat! I asked if I could get bacon that was cooked, the waitress apologized and got it replaced. The new strips were much better, but in the range of applewood smoked bacon it's still mediocre bacon. There wasn't the deep luscious smoked bacon flavor you get from quality bacon purveyors. Onto the burger: It's virtually flavorless. No delicious juices pouring out of this burger as you bit into it. No fantastic grilled beef flavor dancing on your taste buds. The burger itself is super mediocre. We didn't get a shake. It was our original plan, hence the split burger, but we just didn't want to pay for anymore disappointment. We had such a great experience with Jeni's ice cream we decided to revisit them later instead.There are other burger places on yelp with much better reviews. I would pass on this place.

"4111 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"My girlfriends and I were up for trying this hip new burger ""boutique"" that recently opened.  There's even valet; that's fancy, right?  We were told it would be about 25 minutes wait for our table at FLIP Burger Boutique, but in reality it took nearly an hour's wait on a Wednesday night.  That's what we get for going to the popular, new place!  It may have taken longer because we needed an wheelchair accessible table, but I wish they had an established waiting area vs. a ton of people standing huddled around the hostess stand in front of a drafty door.  I kept almost bumping into this group's table/chairs as more people entered.  One of the reason FLIP is so popular is its creative director, chef Richard Blais, winner of Bravo's season 8 'Top Chef All-Stars.'  I don't watch the show, but I knew that the restaurant's ties to reality TV were no doubt responsible for the packed crowd on a weeknight.  The place had modern decor with a throwback retro feel like a diner; it kind of reminded me of the decor in a themed Disney restaurant or something.Because we're super cool chicks, we decided to order milkshakes to start and dig our spoons in.  There was likely double-dipping, but we're blogger buddies so WHY NOT?  We got a Krispy Kreme shake and a Turtle shake, both delicious.  There were doughnut bits in the Krispy Kreme shake, but it wish it had tasted more doughnut-y.  Maybe some cake mix would have helped a little?  Sprinkles?  Still, like I said, both delicious.  Well worth the Lactaids that Lauren and I popped beforehand.Jenna ordered some Braised Brisket Empanadas for the table to split, and they were delicious.  They had this cilantro lime mayo that was a really great complement. I didn't get a photo of these, because we ate them so quickly!As a big-time burger fan, I was anxious to try the main event.  I deviated a bit and did not go for a ""classic"" choice, instead going for their Chorizo burger: chorizo-spiced pork, hashbrowns, fried egg, manchego, Spanish paprika, almond romesco.  (I skipped the smoked mayo, as I'm not a mayo fan.)  Overall, the portion size was generous; I could not finish the whole burger after indulging in the earlier bites!  The burger had great flavor too, though I think the ""hashbrowns"" were actually fries added to the burger.  I added fries to my order (they don't come with the burger) and wish those were a bit more crispy.  They did not exactly win me over on the fries, though again the portions were generous and there were enough to share.I really appreciate that FLIP really thinks about its ingredient sourcing.  That means local pork, organic beef, sustainably sourced fish, and sauces made fresh daily.Would I come back to FLIP?  I might, if a friend wants to go.  It's not bad, though I hope the wait times start to die down.  Burger Republic is still my favorite burger in Nashville, and I also prefer Burger Up and The Pharmacy over FLIP.  But like I said, I would come back if someone else really wanted to, to mix it up and try some of the more creative burgers.",FLIP Burger Boutique,6154542917,155.0,2015-02-16,"Franklin, TN",/biz/flip-burger-boutique-nashville,4.0,169,"Nashville, TN",Aubrey W.,36.1622296,-86.774353,35.1680139,-86.1084401,78.11414522602897,False,3073.0

You know how sometimes you get the vibe that the chef makes a certain thing a certain way, and they really don't want you to change it?  In the most polite way possible, that's the vibe I got, so I ventured.  And I shouldn't have.  The deep fried was too greasy, too much batter, and seriously the outer rim bits of burger were all breading so I just skipped those.At weekday lunch you can combo your burger with a side and soft drink for like $3.50, but of course they give that a fancy name.The sweet potato tater tots were quite good, and they are served with this sweet melty marshmallow-inspired sauce on the side.  It was good, but you can't eat that much sweet.  I like honey mustard with sweet potato tots or fries, but when I asked the server, they don't have honey mustard.  (Remember the polite as can be, this is the why the chef does it comment earlier?  Yea...)Hubby's burger was on point, and his regular fries when dipped in the ranch dressing they did have in house was on point.It was overall a little heavy, would've enjoyed some lettuce or tomato on the burger rather than burger, small almost dry spot of pimento cheese, and three pickles.Lunch for the above with tip was just over $40.  And then we walked that block and a half back up the hill, now super full and wishing we'd have skipped... well, more than we did.Good burger?  Yes.  A little too hip right now, so parking and waits and overall service a little challenged?  Yes.  Best I ever had, so putting up with chef's inspirations and whims, although very politely... no, thanks.",FLIP Burger Boutique,6154542917,299.0,2015-02-09,"Franklin, TN",/biz/flip-burger-boutique-nashville,3.0,169,"Nashville, TN",Sarah B.,36.1622296,-86.774353,35.1680139,-86.1084401,78.11414522602897,False,3603.0

"4111 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"Burgers are my favorite ""bad"" meal - the kind of thing I crave when hungover or when I haven't eaten all day and want to get all my calories at one sitting. I have been to FLIP in Birmingham so I was eagerly anticipating the opening of this place here. Plus, I am a total Top Chef junkie and cannot resist a restaurant by someone I have seen on the show.So I was invited to the friends and family soft opening and agreed immediately. We got there and were seated immediately. Ambiance is casual but modern and slick and new. Big bar in the middle of the room and tables all around.If you were wondering about the menu, well, they have all types of burgers. Yes, as the name says, it is all about burgers so if you don't like that you probably shouldn't go. They do have a turkey burger option, some standard burgers, lamb burger, ""chorizo"" burger, etc and so forth. And they have sides such as fries cooked in beef fat (um...YESSSS), onion rings, etc. Oh and they also have booze, which is my favorite.Drinks were good cocktail creations and there were choices for whatever liquor you prefer. They also have beer and such. And probably Coke and water too but...boring.Given my first trip to FLIP in Birmingham I steered away from the chorizo burger. Not that it isn't good, but that it isn't CHORIZO. To me, that implies a burger either mixed with or totally made out of CHORIZO which is SAUSAGE. This is PORK with CHORIZO SPICES. There's a big difference. Just FYI. So this time I went with the lamb burger because I can totally get into any Mediterranean flavors. The burger was big and well spiced and flavorful. The fries were good as only fries cooked in beef fat can be...if they were just a smidgen skinnier I'd be putting these on my best French Fries list.Service was friendly and excited if a bit disjointed but it was a soft opening so overall was impressed. Our waitress was so pumped about everything on the menu and seemed excited to be working there so it was really fun and refreshing.Definitely give this place a try when you are craving a burger.

"4111 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"I am always searching for a great hamburger in franklin/nashville area. When I heard flip burger was coming to nashville I anxiously awaited while it was built, checking with my friends in Atlanta who worked at flip there about the status, etc.. Total freak about it. When it opened I couldn't wait to try it. I had heard such great things from my friends in Atlanta and the pictures looked awesome. My husband and I finally went and I got the southern burger with fries and a captain crunch milkshake. 1. The burger was so unique and delicious. (Not 'delish' but delicious) It was deep fried, topped with pimento cheese and bread and butter pickles. O.M.G. The deep fried crispies around the patty, aka breading, was very tasty. 2. Fries are NOT included which is stupid but after I finished by burger I didn't even want them.. Which was also a waste of 3 bucks. Boooooo. 3. The milkshake was a disappointment. There was zero nitrogen in it, no foggy awesomeness I had seen in pictures and mine was spilling over the glass when the waitress brought it to my table that she had to go get napkins to clean the glass. It was VERY thin. Not milkshake like at all. And it was a lot smaller than I had anticipated. Just so-so. I was super pumped about the nitrogen shakes too.

The restaurant was full, but no wait and plenty of seating at the bar. Some reviewers noted loud music - that was not an issue for us on Sunday. I ordered the bison burger and the kale slaw. The kale slaw was excellent - cold, crunchy, and not overly doused in mayonnaise, and the portion size was generous. The bison burger was not good. As another reviewer noted, it was more akin to an inexpertly made sloppy joe. The chili completely overpowered the burger, and it made the entire ensemble mushy, a la sloppy joe. A $14 sloppy joe. I'm not a big fan of chili, so my bad for not noticing that chili was an ingredient. That being said, my lady (who likes chili) thought my burger was too chilified as well. Speaking of my lady, she had the sliders, opting for turkey, stack, and fried chicken. She was kind enough to let me sample each. All three were very good. Surprisingly, the fried chicken was our favorite of the bunch. The stack was excellent as well - if I come again, that's what I will order. The turkey was nice too, the alfalfa sprouts made it. She ordered the sweet potato tots. Not good - soggy, no flavor.The bartender (who waited on us) was great. Service was fast.

"4111 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"We arrived at 11:30 AM on a Friday. The parking lot was packed so we figured the restaurant would be packed as well. It was less than a quarter full, so I guess people who come to Flip are averse to car pooling. Hostess greeted us and seated us promptly. We ordered a few appetizers and asked for a little more time to look over the menu. I ended up ordering the lunch special (burger + side + drink for Burger price + 3.75), ordering a Stack, Ceaser Salad and Sweet Tea. The appetizers we ordered arrived promptly: beef tartare, onion rings and fried pickles. The onion rings were a disappointment - slightly undercooked, lacking flavor and mealy. The fried pickles were excellent, although the ones near the bottom were absolutely swimming in grease. The beef tartare was just OK - it tasted mostly of capers and looked really pre-made. Like, put in a ring mold last night and plopped out for our pleasure the next day. A lot of the beef was gray, contrasting sharply with the bits of beef that looked nice and pink. It's just color but visuals matter when you're eating raw meat. There was also something stringy on top, like a sauce that had dried out to the consistency of plastic that was unpleasant. Would not recommend the tartare in the future. Our burgers arrived fairly fast. The Stack was delicious, with the only downside being it was almost too buttery. It tasted a bit like a breakfast sandwich in that respect, but the pickles and b+b sauce were worth the price of entry alone. Burger was actually a bit small - an average male could probably inhale two of these. The Ceaser Salad was ATROCIOUS. I suspected the tartare had been set the night before, but I absolutely believe this Ceasar had been sitting around for at least a couple of hours, if not more. Once you dress a salad, you should eat it right away. The longer it sits, the slimier and nastier it gets. It's inedible after a night in the fridge. This is the salad that was served to me. Nasty, slimy and old. Croutons were the size of crumbs and too few. The whole salad was COVERED in shredded parm, like they were trying to hide the lettuce underneath. I ate a few bites and pushed it to the side. It was a stark contrast to the rest of the meal. I tried some fries too. They were good but cold. Smokey mayo was good. Waitress was OK but she added an extra burger to our tab. So watch your checks. Prices overall weren't terrible but this place is more expensive than say Five Guys. And I really didn't see anything that blew me away besides in the in-house pickles. It was all pretty standard fare. All in all, I would eat here again, but I don't want to fight with people over parking and the lunch rush was overwhelming the restaurant as we were leaving.There were probably 5 or 6 parties waiting for a table.  I also think it's silly that I need to valet my car in this part of town.

"4111 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"It's tough to open a burger place in Nashville, even if you're Richard Blais. With options like The Pharmacy and Burger Republic, outstanding food needs to call me all the way out to Charlotte.As a ""Top Chef"" and Blais fan, I wanted it to be outstanding. I really tried. But with the loud music, absent waiting area and fair food, I won't be returning.Specifically, here's what didn't work for me:1. Since it's a rainy day, the outdoor seating area was closed. My guess is this space is used for overflow for folks waiting for tables. Without that area, the tiny space in front of the host's stand (which inexplicably faces the bar instead of waiting guests) was crowded.2. Other reviewers have noted the loud music, and I'll second/third/fourth their complaint. It's nearly as bad as Adele's sound quality, with the music video-playing TV's volume on blast in the dining area.2. There were nine beers on draught, and they only had three of them. They didn't say if they were out or if those supplies haven't yet arrived -- the restaurant's only been open a week -- and those beers they did have weren't all that appealing or local.3. I ordered the fauxlafel (chickpea, arugula, cucumber, pickled beets, red onion, tzatziki yogurt spread) on a lettuce wrap instead of a bun, which is an option I was glad to see. I expected to be able to pick it up and eat it with my hands; you know, like a lettuce wrap. Instead, the burger was placed atop a wedge of lettuce, so I had to eat it with a knife and a fork. This isn't a minus -- yet the burger was so dry that it crumbled eat time I tried to stab it with the fork. The flavors were nice, and I liked the crisp lettuce against the yogurt spread.4. My husband's bison burger tasted like an elementary school's sloppy joe. It was messy, fell apart and not special. I'm surprised this came from Blais's genius mind; maybe I don't understand it yet? Maybe there are hidden chemical compounds that will burst with flavor in our mouths overnight? Doubtful.Here's what I thought was grand:1. The beef fat french fries come with smoked mayo and ketchup as dipping sauces, and the smoked mayo is excellent. Why have we been dipping into ketchup for so long while this existed in the world? I'm someone who orders truffle fries and regrets it -- They're greasy and not worth the extra couple dollars. Here, the beef fat was light, and the flavor's worth it.2. The milkshakes are delicious. They leave no coating on the roof of your mouth, and are hit-the-spot cold. I had the foie gras milkshake -- yep, that's right; only Blais -- and the server (who had a great personality/disposition) said I'm the first to order it from her. They melt the foie gras down before blending it, and there are small, delicious pebbles of it mixed through the shake. Small bits of doughnut rested in my husband's Krispy Kreme milkshake.There was more ""eh"" than ""yum!"" in our visit this afternoon (around 2:30 on a rainy Sunday with a 25-minute wait), so we're unlikely to return.",FLIP Burger Boutique,6154542917,23.0,2015-01-25,"Hermitage, TN",/biz/flip-burger-boutique-nashville,2.0,169,"Nashville, TN",Katie L.,36.1622296,-86.774353,36.21381235,-86.61299421,9.694586431574802,True,2999.0

An awkward 5 minutes passed from the time we sat down to when the hostess noticed our waiter had not greeted us, so she took our drink and app orders on his behalf.

Not much parking but free valet. Tip your driver hostess was nice and we were seated quickly at 1245 pm on a Saturday.

"4111 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"I decided to take a break from restaurant week and check out FLIP on their grand opening day! YAY! Needless to say, I was not disappointed. FLIP lived up to its expectations! To start off, I ordered the krispy kreme milkshake, which was muy delicioso. HOT DAMN were the milkshakes good! The milkshake had a very thick and creamy texture along with tiny bits of krispy kreme glazed doughnuts. After satisfying my sugar cravings, it was time for the more savory dishes. Even after studying the menu both in store and online countless of times, I will still lost as to what I should order. I know it's lame, but I decided to stick with the classic and added bacon to spice things up. The burger was juicy and had all the components you would want in a burger!!! I was kinda disappointed that this FLIP burger location didn't offer the fry side sampler... As a result, I was forced to give up the onion rings and got the fries and sweet potato tots. sacrifices had to be made... :( The fries were flavorful and not too oily. The tots were AMAZING. (that is saying a lot since i'm not a huge fan of sweet potato) They were seasoned with some sort of spice mix that gave them a little kick. There was also a marshmallow sauce that you could dip the tots in and for me this sauce was what made this side so delicious. It provided the perfect balance to the spice mix.

"4111 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"I visited the first Flip Burger in Atlanta not too long after it opened and it was a great experience. I was a meat eater at the time and the burgers were great, but the shakes were even better. Since then, time has passed, I'm a vegetarian, and now there's a Flip Burger in Nashville. After checking their online menu to be sure there was at least one vegetarian burger option, my husband and I decided to check it out for lunch. It was okay. Pros:*Great flavored shakes*Delicious fauxlafel burger *Friendly serviceCons:*Really bizarre physical layout *Few places to wait (inside)*Fried foods are all swimming in a pool of oil*Straws were too narrow in the shakes, or they weren't blended enough*Expensive for what it is*Slow serviceGood for kids? I don't feel like this is a place where I would take my almost 5yo. Not because of the food or the atmosphere, but mostly for the slow service. Maybe in a few months when the hype has worn off, the wait times for a table have decreased, and the hiccups in service have been worked out. At the same time, it's not really a date night kind of place to me. Good for vegetarians? Well, they definitely had some vegetarian-friendly options. The fauxlafel burger was probably the best version of a falafel burger that I've ever had - lots of places offer this, but almost no one in Nashville does it well. It wasn't the best vegetarian burger I've had in Nashville though - that would be a tie between Fido and J Alexander's. The beet and goat cheese salad was really large and very tasty. It's a bummer not to be able to enjoy the fries here, since they're fried in beef tallow (but at least they're up front about it). They also have a veggies and hummus platter, if that's your thing. Overall impressions:We arrived a little bit before noon on a Wednesday and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. No big deal and not a surprise for a recently opened restaurant. However, this left us with some time to ponder the really bizarre layout. If it's cold out, the only place for customers to wait is the fairly small open area right by the check in desk. I suppose people could wait at the bar if they wanted, but all of the bar seats were taken while we were there by people eating lunch. This won't be a problem in warm weather (lots of space to wait outside), but it really made me wonder if Flip failed to do their homework re: the local climate, and didn't understand that it does get colder in Nashville.      That brings me to weird layout thing #2. They didn't have double doors, so basically, every time someone came into or left the restaurant, there were major drafts throughout the entire front half of the restaurant. And this was on a fairly warm day! And that leads naturally into weird layout thing #3: between the awkward non-waiting waiting area and the drafts, the weirdly positioned tables on either side of the front door seemed really unpleasant to sit at - which is of course where we ended up getting seated.      The food itself was decent. The beet salad was tasty, although verging on over-dressed. It would be nice if they offered a fauxlafel burger patty as an add on for salads, instead of just meat. The fauxlafel burger was fab, as I said above. Both the onion rings and the fried cheese curds were served in a kind of odd way. I'm used to fried foods having some kind of paper to absorb grease at the bottom of the serving dish. In this case, there was no paper, so there was basically a lake of oil at the bottom of each. The top layer of fried food was great, but everything towards the bottom was just greasy and nasty. The onion rings were also served at a fairly tepid temperature. The shakes were as tasty as I remembered them being from the last time we visited the original Atlanta location, but either they were under-blended or they're using some straws that are just too small for the chunks of stuff in the shake.  Our bill for one vegetarian burger, one salad, an order of fried cheese curds, a side of onion rings, and two shakes was $38, pre-tip. Big safety concern: Their valet parking lot is across Charlotte from the restaurant. This means their valets have to dash on foot across the incredibly busy traffic on Charlotte and then navigate your car to the restaurant parking lot. This is, in one word, TERRIBLE. Not only is it a safety issue for their valets, it's a huge safety issue for anyone driving on Charlotte. So, if you're driving past Flip, please be aware that this is going on. I have no idea who approved this idea, but they were nuts. It was scary to watch on a sunny, bright day; I shudder to think what it's like at night.",FLIP Burger Boutique,6154542917,51.0,2015-02-05,"Nashville, TN",/biz/flip-burger-boutique-nashville,3.0,169,"Nashville, TN",Kim U.,36.1622296,-86.774353,36.1622296,-86.774353,0.0,True,4638.0

I understand that it may be a liability to have customers walking through the service station but based on how service was going, our little personal bathroom escort should've been busy assisting his co workers and getting some tables turned. 3rd rant -The food was average at best. Out of the 6 people at our table, not one person's burger was cooked as specified...medium rare was well done, medium was well done, well done was rare. I got the Trio with the classic, butcher block, and turkey with beef fat fries. All 3 were over cooked and dryer than dry. The toppings were basic and underwhelming. Overall I was not super stoked on this place but I'm hoping it's just the inevitable hiccups that happen with a new restaurant opening. I will go back in a few months to see if there is any improvement because the concept is great, but for now I'll be sticking to Burger Republic and The Pharmacy.",FLIP Burger Boutique,6154542917,10.0,2015-01-24,"Franklin, TN",/biz/flip-burger-boutique-nashville,1.0,169,"Nashville, TN",Jenny H.,36.1622296,-86.774353,35.1680139,-86.1084401,78.11414522602897,False,2034.0

We started off with the Fried Pickles & Fried Cheese Curds.  I prefer Dill pickles, and these were B+B, but the breading was incredible and just the right amount without overkilling the frying.  If you're a B+B pickle fan, this should be an automatic go-to.   The Fried Cheese Curds could not have been more perfect, and I am not exaggerating when I say they are the best I've had. Ever. The cheese curds are served with a sauce that tasted a little like tartar sauce to me, and I think that could be swapped out with a spicy ranch of some sort to give it a nice power kick, but once again personal preference...Moving on to the burger, I got the Butcher's Cut, medium, and it was cooked to perfection. Pink + juicy center, while not moo-ing.  Just the right amount of blue cheese as well, so it was not overpowering. And whatever is in that red wine jam, I want it on everything. I got a side of fries and OH MY GOSH! These were the perfect combo of crunchy on the outside, yet mushy on the inside. I almost went with the sweet tater tots (and definitely will try at some point!), but so happy I went with the fries. A ""side"" is enough for (2) people in my opinion as well. Next time I'll definitely have to try a Nutella Milkshake..... Highly recommended, and worth the wait! You can always go next door to The Beer Pale and grab a beer.

"4111 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"In a landscape that's pretty saturated with gourmet burger places, we were curious to see how FLIP Burger was going to stand apart. I was skeptical at naming it a ""boutique"", but after dining there, I actually think the name is quite appropriate. FLIP's focus isn't on making the ""best burger"" per se, but rather on providing unique twists and flavor combinations using a burger as base. It's a subtle distinction, but comes down to what the focus point of the meal is. We tried the Butcher's Cut, and while the patty itself was nothing extraordinary, the melding of the other ingredients/toppings made for a very tasty dinner in the end. The wife had the Chorizo burger, which was also quite good. The egg was too runny for our taste, making for a very messy meal, but the overall flavor was quite nice. The biggest food disappointment for us was the burnt marshmallow foam with the sweet potato tots. The tots were excellent, but the heat from the tots melted the marshmallow foam into a gooey mess.

HOWEVER, NO one was able to see the fireworks. Many people like myself waited hours to enjoy the fireworks and were not made aware of the blocked view. When I asked for my money back, I was told that I signed a ""contract"" saying I understood the view would be blocked. I never signed anything of that sort and simply walked in and bought my tickets and that was the end of it. There was NO mention of the very limited view. I have pics of the ""view"" or lack thereof, and plan to post them on tripadvisor. I encourage you to go there and see it. Hundreds were ripped off on July 4th.

"100 BroadwayNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"We had been to the HR last weekend and our server sold us on the HR's NYE private party. We decided to go with the least expensive ticket at $75 per person since we had to buy 3. We were told we would be outside, but it would be covered, heated and have a table/seating. It would also include access to the HR Café itself and the bathrooms. Luckily we had eaten prior to arriving at the HR for NYE. We were supposed to be let in at 8pm. After waiting in line the HR security finally let us in at 8:15pm. There was a very small covered area with 2 heaters. The area where the tables/seating was not covered nor were there any heaters. There was one bar and absolutely zero wait staff. We were given 2 drink tickets, but after we used those tickets we were only allowed to order from the limited bar outside. The HR had security at every door and would not allow us into the café, the bar inside or the store. We could only go to the bathroom and then had to leave. About 15 mins before midnight I went to the bathroom again and saw they were giving out champagne to the people inside. There was none provided outside nor were we given the option to purchase a glass. This was the only time in the night there was not security at the door guarding the café, so I walked into the bar and asked the bartender if I could get a couple of glasses of champagne. He looked at me in disgust and said ""yeah, if you paid for it"" and walked away. My badge clearly said ""club level"" so he knew I was not part of the $125 ticket for inside. I was completely offended. After I had just spent $100 eating there with my family on Sunday night, then another $300 for NYE. I was treated so poorly. I wasn't asking for it for free, I would have happily purchased it. I live in Nashville and am appalled that someone in our city would treat paying customers so poorly. There were 2, yes 2 heaters outside for about 100 people. It was ridiculous. Yes, we had a great view of the main stage, and yes we didn't have to fight for a bathroom, but after spending $400 at the HR in one week I would have expected to have been treated better.

I love love love their chicken noodle like soup. Their noodles are a white noodle and they look like bamboo shoots. These are not bamboo shoots so they are carbs. But whatever... it is great chicken soup for 8 or 9 dollars. If soup is not your go to, their eggplant dish is sooo good for vegetarians. Their Black pepper shrimp is wonderful and the the Kung Pow is also our go to.  They have Dan Dan noodles too. All favorites. We also have had their Tuna Sashimi. Save that for  your Japanese rest. visit, unless you really need some. Also the dumplings. You can get those at the grocery and they are good, but spend your money where you can't get it somewhere else. They used to have a corking thing where if you  bought some wine and did not finish it, you could take it home. I don't know if they do that anymore. That was about 7 years ago when we heard about it. Most servers are extremely knowledgeable. If you don't like one. ask for another .The managers are very good. Bathrooms were clean.

"2525 West End AvenueNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I'm probably the only Nashvillian who hadn't eaten at P.F. Chang's up until two weeks ago, but you'll have to forgive me because I was too poor to eat there before I moved to Canada (to whom I must give thanks for paying me a living wage). I listened to acquaintances goo and gush over the menu, wondering what the hell was so special about a place with pan-Asian cuisine. On a personal level, I wonder no longer, yet I'm still no closer to understanding what all the to-do was about. A friend and I arrived at about 7 p.m. on a Wednesday night. The restaurant was busy, but not full, and we were seated almost immediately. I knew something was weird when servers kept stopping by the neighboring table. It didn't take long for them to start sitting down and chumming with the table's occupants, who I'm pretty sure were fellow servers off the clock. If you've ever worked in a restaurant, you should have some idea that it's not kosher to sit down at a friend's table when you're on the floor, and that it's totally inappropriate to help yourself to bites of their food and sips of their drinks. And the incessant up-down, down-up was supremely annoying. Our own server wasn't fraternizing with them, thankfully, and he mitigated the behavior of his annoying co-workers. He kept our glasses full and our meals straight (without an order pad). I had a forgettable drink (a margarita?--you'd think I'd be able to remember something like that, seeing as I only had one), then some passable spring rolls, which, based on the menu's description, I expected to be fresh and raw rather than fried. I had the seared ahi tuna salad, which was tasty, but again, nothing mind-blowing, and tried my friend's cucumbers (also tasty). I hadn't eaten anything extraordinarily bad (save the spring rolls), but I was left with a lethargic food hangover, which makes me think there was fat and sugar hiding in everything else I ate.In sum, far from the worst dining experience I've ever had, but also far from the best. At $70 for two appetizers, a salad, a side, and three drinks, I think I'll pass in the future (or let someone else pay).",P.F.

"2525 West End AvenueNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Went here with my fiance for our 3 year anniversary. Thank goodness we made a reservation as the place was packed and the wait was, from what I was hearing, an hour or more for those just walking in. We only had to wait about 20 minutes as we had a reservation.Again, save yourself the wait, especially if you are going for a special occasion (birthday, anniversary, etc...) and put in a reservation online in advance. Usually 48 to 72 hours before hand is good enough to get the time you want, except on really busy days, like Valentine's for example.Also, while PF Chang's is definitely not authentic it is still very good, and a wide variety at that. Honestly, at least as far as I am aware, finding a good vegetarian chinese restaurant is not easy, that being said I like meat, but still not all my friends do.Anyway, I digress. As to our experience, our waitress was really nice and took great care of us. The service was fast and the food was excellent as per usual. And when I asked for a big dish of lemons for my water, the waitress brought me a cup size bowl of full of lemons. The salt n pepper calamari was perfect and the dumplings were absolutely delicious. Originally I wanted to try something new, but once again I caved to getting my favorite, the Singapore Street Noodles and once again, I was not disappointed, they were so good I cleaned my plate.

Austin has a location of its own and of which I was acquainted, so I knew what I was in for.This location shares a parking lot with the Borders, a Starbucks, and a Fleming's Steakhouse, among other businesses, so parking is going to be an issue. We opted to use the valet service, which technically doesn't charge you, but works for tips. Still, it's worth it if you have already spent five minutes trying to snipe for a parking spot.We started off with appetizers: lettuce wraps and Sichuan flatbread, which were great. The lettuce wraps do require some assembly and therefore can get a little messy, but it's worth it. My entree of Chengdu Spiced Lamb could have been better, but because it's only one of two lamb dishes on their menu, it doesn't appear to be a specialty, as far as I know.The service was pleasant and prompt; I don't remember my beer glass to be empty for too long.The impressive part of the night came when we had to split the tab (ah, the joys of business travel and separate checks). There were six of us paying for our individual entrees, but five of us splitting the appetizers because we weren't letting my friend pay.

I know I'm not alone in having these cravings. My friends and I will sometimes book a reservation for a Friday or Saturday night and have a really nice, long relaxed dinner there. One of the best things to do is go with a bunch of people and just order appetizers. If you have enough people, you can order all of them and get a great variety of food. It makes for good picking and conversing, especially if you wash it all down with some cocktails.

"2800 Opryland DrNashville, TN 37246",3.0,The Jack Daniels saloon is located in the Opryland hotel in Nashville. I have only here once and the food was okay. At first when we arrived we did not have a reservation and I noticed that there were big casks outside of the restaurant that look like liquor was in them. I did ask the hostess if there were actual liquor in the castle she said The casts were just for show. I did have four people eating with me and our waiter was actually really nice and accommodating he really knew the menu well and he had a good selection of things that he recommended without us having to ask him for recommendations. We did not get any of the appetizers here I ordered a double shot of Jack straight and the two other people I was with got Jack and cokes and the other person I was with just got a beer. The waiter did say that the brisket was highly recommended. Two of the people I was with had a hard time choosing between getting the ribs or the brisket both of them ended up settling on the brisket. Me on the other hand I ended up getting a smoked Gouda cheeseburger with bacon and brisket on top The burger was garnished with crispy onion straws. When I receive the burger it looked absolutely amazing. I was very excited to try this burger. I took my first bite into the burger and I noticed that the burger was just okay there wasn't a tremendous amount of flavor from the burger. What I did taste was the onion straws the smoked Gouda cheese and the brisket. The brisket on top of the cheeseburger actually tasted very good. Knowing what I do now if I did eat here again I would just ask for brisket. One of the people that I was with that just got the brisket and it up substituting his side for macaroni and cheese. He told me he wished that he didn't get the macaroni and cheese because it was extremely dry. I tasted some of the macaroni and cheese and it was not something that I would've eaten. They definitely had it sitting for a while and they just reheated it quickly. I have had better microwavable macaroni and cheese then the macaroni and cheese that they had. I did think that my burger was a little bit expensive it was $19 for the burger with the brisket. I know you're having brisket to it but it was really only three pieces of brisket and if you charge a dollar for each strip of brisket. It's still a $16 burger. The one issue I did have was that they do not have a bathroom inside of the restaurant. I ended up having to walk through the entire restaurant go outside in the hall and walk down the hallway to go use the public restroom. Overall I did enjoy the ambience of this restaurant.

But if you compare this Chinese buffet against the competition in Nashville, it easily deserves 4 out of 5 stars.Most of the sushi except one or two dishes were sub-par. However the sub-par items generally found throughout the entire buffet aren't bad by all means. Most of the items were in fact decent for Nashville standards. The best items in the entire restaurant are against the back wall where most of the grilled items are found, including the 'choose your own ingredients' Mongolian BBQ. However I suggest to everyone to stay away from their Teriyaki sauce (way, way too sweet). Stick to the soy sauce, it's much more tolerable (unless you like your Mongolian BBQ to be overly sweet).The shrimp and fish items do not taste old or stale, which is quite surprising for Chinese buffet standards. While it's certainly not the best seafood in town, I can easily say that the coconut shrimp was much better than most shrimp dishes offered at non-buffet Chinese restaurants in Nashville. I personally stuck to that and various chicken items and grilled BBQ pork near the Mongolian BBQ area.For those who don't like Asian buffet items, you'll always find the random pizza slices somewhere.

It's ten or twenty times larger than Golden Coast, and while there's not as much ""traditional"" or ""dim sum"" items as GC, let's face it, Golden Coast wasn't very golden in that respect either.

From a vegetarian perspective, the options are more limited, but you can definitely make a very full meal with your basic Americanized ""Asian buffet"" spread. Here's what was available on a Saturday lunch for vegetarians:  spring rolls (the thin skin was crispy, hot, and overall surprisingly decent), fried donuts (like a mini-funnel cake), mei fun, chow mein noodles, fried rice, vegetable delight (broccoli, waterchestnut, lettuce), string beans, spinach with cheese, sauteed potatoes, sweet corn, inari with seaweed, veggie sushi (not labeled, just have to choose carefully, but it's usually the one with lots left as the non-vegetarians have grabbed the fish ones), fried plantains (not very good), fried zucchini (disappointing), mac & cheese (actually not too bad), cheese pizza (I didn't even try...), onion rings (decent!), french fries, garlic bread, sesame balls (a ""dim sum"" item I suppose), assorted salads, cut fruits (watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, oranges), and tons of desserts (cookies, cakes, ice cream, etc).

"3804 Nolensville RdNashville, TN 37211",3.0,"I am ranking Hibachi Grill and Supreme Buffet only a mere 3 stars currently based on their lack of sushi options, but I will preface that this place deserves a few more visits. (and it's a buffet I can't expect too much).I have come here for Dinner with the family and lunch on my own. My latest visit was a solo lunch close to 1pm. The restaurant was fairly busy with a mix of families and work-lunch goers like myself. I was seated right away and offered a drink. I proceeded to grab my first few items, starting with the sushi bar. I was disappointed to find a mix of mostly imitation crab style rolls, and a few with cheap veggies and cream cheese. I grabbed a few that looked okay and moved onto the hot bars. Being that I don't eat any meat other than fish, this was challenging. For those who enjoy meat dishes, there are plenty. A lot of tasty looking chicken dishes both traditional Chinese/ Japanese fare and American fried foods as well. You have your run of the mill cream cheese won ton which I enjoyed, and some different items like a meat carving station which I thought was a nice touch for such an inexpensive buffet.They offer as the name indicates a Hibachi style grill, the crowd was a bit much, so I didn't partake this time around. I opted for some veggie dishes, noodles and rice all were hot and had good flavor. Each of the hot bars appeared to be fresh and the items recently rotated, I noticed there was an attendant each time I went up tending to them and cleaning the counters. On my next round I checked the sushi bar again, still lacking, many empty spots so i skipped it and grabbed another small plate of a few choice items on the hot bar. Finally at my third attempt the Sushi Chef had placed a few rolls on the bar worth trying, salmon and tuna included. I enjoyed both. This buffet is ideal if you are looking for a busy place with quick turn over of foods, I don't see how anything could ""sit"" for very long here as the crowds keep it fresh. While the place is busy it's huge, reminds me of smaller casinos in Vegas a lot of funky decor but still appears clean. The servers aren't the best, but this is a buffet they take a while to get drink refills out, but mine on this particular visit was very pleasant. My ticket with a drink was $9.79! So with tip it was still under $15 for a great deal of food and finally some pretty good sushi.

"3623 Gallatin RdNashville, TN 37216",4.0,"Las Fiestas Cafe is a relatively new Mexican joint on the East Side that moved into the location formerly occupied by Cat's Music and Smiley's Soul Food Cafe. While there is a plethora of good Mexican places in the neighborhood (El Jalicience quickly becoming my favorite), Las Fiestas has been recommended most often for breakfast. There are few things in the world that get me as excited as a breakfast burrito (one of the worlds most perfect foods as far as I'm concerned) so I knew I was going to have to check this place out. The decor is ""meh"" at best. It looks like they picked up their dining sets from an old hotel that was letting go of their continental breakfast area. We went on a Sunday morning and the place was empty. For most of our dining experience We were the only people in the restaurant. And let me take a guess at why: They were BLASTING TV preacher Joel Osteen on the two large screen TVs. In addition to the unwanted religion I was getting with my burrito, they were playing salsa music over the televised church service. I'm all about mashups, but this was downright annoying. If I wanted to hear a sermon, I would spend my Sunday morning in church. I wanted a burrito, which has nothing to do with Christianity in the slightest. My one major recommendation for this restaurant would be to show sports/music videos on the TVs on MUTE, and play the salsa music in the background. We started out with our morning coffee. It was fresh, but unremarkable. It tasted very much like typical bottom-less cup diner coffee.But we were there for the burritos, and boy did we get them. Las Fiestas' breakfast menu is pretty traditional American/Southern stuff, with the exception of the Burrito Loco. The Loco is filled with eggs, your choice of chorizo, bacon or beef, topped with pico and queso. Since I'm not a big queso fan, I asked for salsa verde instead. This burrito was MASSIVE, filling, and very tasty. For the price, you can't really beat this breakfast.Let's also talk about their home fry potatoes- possibly my favorite thing at this place. They are half circles cut thin and pan fried until almost crispy and dusted with a great mix of spices. These little slices of heaven tasted really good dipped in my leftover salsa verde. By the time we were finished eating, Reverend Osteen finished his programming and was replaced with an informercial on skin cream- which was also at full volume and not shut off.

Well, don't think too hard about it because Ichiban is here and fantastically real. The warm wood, full bar and expansive menu offers many experiences far past maki, I have found this restaurant to be one of the Music City's finest offerings when it comes to rolls.The only real issue is getting here. Ichiban doesn't have a parking lot and its location on 2nd Ave means that parking is an adventure in frustration. I can count on one hand the number of times I've been able to score street parking anywhere near the joint. So, when planning an evening here, think about transportation well in advance. Otherwise, you're setting yourself up for a bad time. Once you've figured out parking, however, everything else is aces.Whether dining in or eating out, make sure you take advantage of the marvelous maki that awaits at Ichiban. Being that I don't enjoy cream cheese or mayo or any sort on my rolls (come on, Americans; we can do better than that), my taste in rolls falls pretty squarely in the sushi chef's wheelhouse. I've been impressed by the Ichiban roll, spider roll, holly roll, rainbow roll, and caterpillar roll. All five have fantastic flavor, good balance, a nice amount of pieces for the prices, and none of the devil's condiments on raw fish. When feeling particularly hungry, you might even find me ordering a crab salad. While not the trendiest or most fab (location-wise) of sushi establishments in Nashville, Ichiban offers up really good product again and over again. Those 2nd Ave rents aren't cheap, y'all.

"1703 Church StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"This is an update.  Been here twice since within the past 4 weeks and well...the experience was DEFINITELY not up to par. Was here June 29th and I came alone.  I sat a table with a couple of friends who were already there.  I stopped a server and ordered a drink, waited SEVERAL minutes, never got a drink. One of my friends stopped her again and asked about my drink and she replied, ""I got it coming"".  NEVER GOT IT!  He had to go the the bar to get my drink. Friday, July 3rd, had to be the worst it's ever been! Me and 3 other colleagues, (one was visiting from out of state on business) came here around 6:30 or 7 ish.  This bar was not my first choice but I came anyway. There wasn't anywhere to sit so we inquired about sitting on the platform or stage (whatever you call it)  A server, who's attitude was rather dry and unpleasant, informed us that it was $50 an hour to sit there.  One thing I did notice was the poor condition of the furniture; table was nasty and the leather seats were falling apart at the bottom. But the charge is $50 an hour to sit here? NOPE! We went to the very back of the building in a smaller bar area.  This was my first time going back there.  It was very dim, poor lighting and we sat there for about 10 minutes.  Two servers practically walked by us without any acknowledgment. And why have a bar in the back with no alcohol stock and no bartender?? One server spent majority of her time chatting with 4 women who was sitting on the opposite side of where we were sitting.  They had most of her attention the duration we were back there. One of our male colleagues stopped this server and asked if we could place a drink order.  She replied, ""Give me just one second"".  That one second turned into approximately 12 minutes before she actually returned to the area and she still did not get our drink order.  We managed to stop another server who GLADLY took our order and was very prompt. She wasted no time taking care of us.  I don't remember her name but she was light-skinned, real pretty, curly hair that came past her shoulders. She checked on us frequently during our time there, was very professional and pleasant.  The first server, still, never acknowledged us or even extended an apology for the wait.  Our mood had changed and once we finished our drinks we decided to leave and go elsewhere.  Went to Acme on Broadway and got much better service.  At this point, I'm not sure I'll return.  The servers can stand some re-training, and this is coming from a business professional.",WKND,6157396345,85.0,2015-07-06,"Nashville, TN",/biz/wknd-nashville-2,2.0,19,"Nashville, TN",Alicia M.,36.1622296,-86.774353,36.1622296,-86.774353,0.0,True,2553.0

The earlier you get there, the better the deal. They have a cool ""house party"" theme on Saturday nights as well. The crowd is urban young adult, so it's very chill and relaxed.

"1703 Church StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"My fiance and I were sitting around in silence last night, each working away at our respective laptops when he casually suggested ""happy hour?"" Without hesitation, I slammed my computer shut and said ""Happy hour!""With an affinity for trying new places, we made our way down to Church Street to see the million pennies in WKND's decor. Unfortunately, as we sat at the bar, we noticed some mean-head had pried a penny out of the counter... so make that one million, minus one. Jerk. Otherwise, flawless! The copper tone of the counters and floors were so unique and made me wonder how I could duplicate this in my own home.But really, the fun here is between 4-7pm (Wed-Sat) where they have daily HH specials on food and beverages. (I recommend the Wednesday special of 1/2 off Skinny Cajun Penne Pasta and the $3 Appletinis.) And if you're as ambitious as we are, you'll indulge in a pitcher -- yes, pitcher -- of booze with your choices of Mimosas, Rum Punch, Margaritas, Mojitos... and our two recommendations of the evening: Sangria & Long Island Iced Tea. Those puppies run $26-$37/each, but worth it? Um, yes. I'll also say, that as a female, I really appreciated the hooks under the bar. No bar floor grime on the bottom of my purse... hooray!Outside of the bar area, WKND is a huge open space with tons of plush seating. It's exactly what you think a lounge should look like. Swank, swank, swank.Off to the side, there's another room designated for hookahs complete with a second bar (only open on the weekends). And if we can talk hookah for a second, I'll just go ahead and recommend the Blue Magic (tastes like blue raspberry + heaven). The downside is the hookahs run steepish at $25/each. Also, it appears they're still working out the kinks with their hookah hookup. We arrived at 6pm and were told the hookah lounge would open in an hour. Later, we found out the ""hookah guy"" was supposed to be there at 4pm. Not that we were upset, but Brian (the GM) was so nice about it anyway, making sure to comp our pipe when another hookah competitor was chomping at the bit to save the day.On the way out, my fiance announced we'd found our new neighborhood bar.

I got smart and ordered 2 drinks at once because I knew that I would not see her again.
