"8128 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37221",3.5,"Best restaurant in Bellevue, TN. Before starting this review, however, a bit about Bellevue. We are, in many ways, the pit of mediocre food. So when I hear of a pricier restaurant in the area, I am a bit leery. Maybe that is why it took me 7 years to try Bria?This was a date night for my wife and I. We started out with Copolla Rosso and an antipasto plate. I was curious about other wines, but the mix of wine types in the Rosso sounded interesting.The antipasto is a mix of goat cheese, feta cheese, some meats and olives and figs. The appetizer is a bit pricier than some places, but as one who loves quality deli meats, it was a treat. And a variety of olives is always nice.We then went to salads and since Bria is Italian, I had to go with the caprese. Wonderful mozzarella and local heirloom tomatoes with fresh basil and a light vinaigrette. The main dish was the best part. I had a pork chop with brodcolini and fingerling potatoes. The pork was cooked to a nice medium, so it had a decent texture and a wonderful taste. The fingerling potatoes were cooked so they still had a bit of texture. A bit of heaven on a plate. My only suggestion, which I told the manager, is ""go bold"" and go a bit more rare to give it an even better texture. I would consider 5 stars, but I am not sure it is the best of the best. It is great, but not quite ""The Catbird Seat"". Then again, it is not as pricey.We will be back.",Bria Bistro Italiano,6156468274.0,36.0,2015-08-12,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bria-bistro-italiano-nashville,4.0,54,"Washington, DC",Gregory B.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.1622296,-86.774353,566.7091028370305,False,1415.0,3.5,3.0,3.519230769230769

First, I loss the pre-game coin toss and had to foot the bill, second, it's a long drive from where I live in midtown, and third, I have been so disappointed with what passes for Italian cuisine since moving to Nashville, e.g. Demo's ""hey, let git some EYE-Tall-yun!""When we arrived we were promptly seated at a tiny table right next to the Ladies restroom. Strike four. I requested a new table, and from there our experience went from one star to four.As many have commented, the bread was...puzzling. Certainly not Italian bread, meh at best. Now the good stuff. Our waiter was terrific. The antipasto was fabulous. Well balanced, great flavors - 5 stars. The bruschetta was very good as well, but not the best coupling with the antipasto (too much goat cheese between the two). I had the chicken  saltimbocca. Very good but a bit on the salty side for my taste.  Excellent presentation though. She had the spaghetti. It was a a home run. One of the few times I've had Nashville Italian pasta that was properly cooked, 5 stars. We skipped dessert. The space is nice, that atmosphere was cool as well - a very eclectic crowd, if weighted towards the Ye Olde Steakhouse set. I thought the pricing was fair - two apps, two entrees, about $50. As I mentioned, we skipped dessert, and didn't imbibe. Would I drive all the way out here again? Maybe. If someone insisted on Italian food.

"8128 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37221",3.5,"I walked in not knowing how much I was going to spend. I LOVE Italian and enjoy cooking it. However my 2 person $120 meal was very disappointing. Salads were good. We both had Caesars and the dressing was perfect. The crouton was awful! It was so large you had to cut it, (have you ever tried to cut a crouton!?) and was seasoned with Cajun spices so it ruined the flavor of the dressing. Needless to say I only had one. Veal saltimbocca was no good, the balsamic had not been reduced and made my eyes water. Speaking of balsamic, since WHEN does it include balsamic!?? If you add a twist to a traditional, easy to follow recipe, do it well! The meat was also not very tender, at least for veal. My chicken piccata was more tender. I had the piccata and again a failure at a traditional and easy to make dish. Prior to ordering I asked if the artichokes were fresh because I hate the taste of canned artichokes and a lot of places will add it to add the tart flavor. The Server told me they were so either he was pushing the sale or uneducated because they were not fresh. The sauce was literally a broth/gravy packet mixed with lemon juice. I'm really not trying to be negative but there's no denying it, it was watered down McCormick mix and lemon juice poured over seared (clearly not dredged) chicken then topped with capers, pickled artichokes, and tomatoes (WHY TOMATOES). Overall it tasted ok, but I ordered PICATTA not some Italian Frankenstein chicken. It really bothers me going to a nice Italian place only to see the dishes butchered by someone ruining easy recipes. Don't call it PICATTA if that's not what you're going to make!The service was acceptable and most guests around us were getting good service, us not so much. However we were not dressed appropriately and we often get judged because we are younger. The patrons around were getting good service.Dessert was another fail. Tiramisu. My bf liked it because he's not crazy about coffee, and there was NONE in this! If you like rum and mascarpone cheese, this is for you!! It's funny because the mascarpone was high quality but not prepared properly and there was no custard at all. I had two bites, but ray devoured it. Overall this reminds me of a place that does things their way, but not well. Italian is so good, and easy that it's frustrating to order something that should be relatively the same everywhere. I give it two stars because the service is good, atmosphere is wonderful, and wine selection is great! I would come again for drinks and apps, not for Italian food.

"8128 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37221",3.5,"Been to Bria several times. I have had several dishes, usually its a great experience. Varied menu, usually very good service, food. This weekend I ordered the 1/2 roasted chicken. I cut immediately into the thickest part to make sure its cooked through to the bone. It is NEVER ok to serve chicken that has blood in it. Ever. Period. It should never be a discussion with your customer. Take it back immediately, if served by mistake. Do not say ""Oh you just hit that vein"" when I cut into the thigh, see not only blood in the vein, but can press the meat and have blood surface in the flesh. You could have caused a serious bacterial infection in me or any other customer. Stop this! Train your cooks! Train your servers. Don't serve undercooked chicken!Roasted chicken is NOT smoked chicken that is sometimes pink inside because of the cooking process of smoking. Even smoked chicken that has pink meat has solidly cooked veins and no blood. Blood means it is NOT cooked all the way. Roasted chicken should not have blood in it. This is so fundamental to cooking roasted chicken that I can't comprehend how a restaurant usually as up to par as Bria could not only serve it, but defend it to their customer.I ordered Eggplant Parm to replace it, which came out fairly quickly, though it messed up the pace of dinner with my guest since they had been served and I sat and waited for a replacement. The server who brought the replaced dish also tried to say ""Oh you just hit that vein"" as though the cooks had been making this excuse to them for a while. One server commented that this happened before, that is often happens when the roasted chicken is served. I'm not sure what was worse, the bloody chicken or the wait staff telling me this was common, it was OK to eat, but they'd get me something else if I really wanted to send it back, or acting as if this was standard at Bria.If you've never had food poisoning from undercooked chicken, perhaps you don't know just how frickin' miserable it is to get, but I have had it from being served undercooked chicken on the bone that was supposedly roasted at a restaurant, and I know bloody chicken when I see it. The kitchen should not send this out, period. The wait staff should not be told to tell customers that ""Its ok, you just hit the vein, its OK to eat it."" It is NOT ok to eat it. Chicken blood present mean undercooked chicken. That vein should be cooked solid with the rest of the chicken, and the meat coming away from the bone. That's when a chicken is cooked properly. If your chef or his line cooks don't know this, you have a bigger problem on your hands. I will be back to Bria because overall I like the place, the food is usually very good, but I won't order the roasted chicken again until I know that the owners and chef have addressed not only how to cook and serve chicken on the bone, but how to handle a customer when it is served undercooked. I was made to feel like I was complaining about something I should not be, that this was OK to eat, that this was OK and standard at Bria. If it is, it should not be.

For an Italian restaurant, they commit a pretty big sin.  They serve terrible bread with no character.  Really, it is pretty close to Pepperidge Farm french bread.  Now, I lived in the New York area and I do not expect Nashville restaurants to have Arthur Avenue bread, but there are some decent options.  After complaining several times, I brought in a couple of loaves of Bella Nashville bread to have with our meal and to let the manager try it and see the difference.  FYI, I am not affiliated with Bella Nashville.  Frankly, the Krogers across the street carries a nice ciabatta that is significantly better than the bread Bria normally serves.  Anyway, we asked the waitress to have the loaves heated up and then have the manager come over to try it with us.  Well, they brought us the warmed bread, but the manager REFUSED to come by the table.  Really.  Their bread may be a sin, but this incident is a mortal sin!  I have never been to a restaurant where the manager did not come to the table when asked.  If he did not want to try the bread, he at least should have had the guts to come to the table and tell us.It is clear that my experience is very much in line with other reviews here.  The management of this restaurant is doing their own thing and that does not include listening to or valuing their customers.",Bria Bistro Italiano,6156468274.0,22.0,2015-02-07,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bria-bistro-italiano-nashville,2.0,54,"Washington, DC",BJ S.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.1622296,-86.774353,566.7091028370305,False,2008.0,3.5,3.0,3.519230769230769
"8128 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37221",3.5,"We live in the neighborhood...no more than 5 mins down the road. Bria has been one of our very few neighborhood restaurants that we have frequented in the 4 years that we've lived here. Anyone who lives in this area knows that the choices are few and not so great. But, it's an adequate close to home option when we want to take the night off from cooking & don't want to drive in to Nashville.As far as ambiance goes, I'd give it 3 1/2 stars. It's cozy, reverberant (but not annoyingly so). I like seeing in to the kitchen and the wait staff has always been great. It's a quaint neighborhood spot.Food...well, we've had very good experiences and very bad experiences. I don't know if the fluctuation in quality has to do with who's cooking that night or who's managing, but it has a tendency to be a bit unreliable. Example 1 of several incidents; my husband sent his lasagna back because it was ice cold in the center (was it previously frozen? Certainly not made fresh). When it was returned to the table, it had been thoroughly heated through & a gob of cheese stuffed in to the empty hole where he had originally dished out. Was pretty lame & I was considering not returning. They were nice about it & credited our check. Alternately, after having not been in for a few months, the salmon entree that I ordered & the steak that my husband ordered were absolutely perfect. So, we added Bria back in to our main rotation again. Great, since it's literally around the corner from us.Well, our most recent visit has proven officially to be our last...and it really bums me out. We have kids...O Lord! We are one of those crazy couples who actually like to eat in public with our children. I know. Insane, right? Our very first visit to Bria, our daughter was just over a year old. We requested a high chair, but they informed us that they currently only had booster seats. It sounded as though maybe they might be getting a couple of high chairs at some point? The booster was definitely not ideal at the time & my (mommy) dining experience wasn't great since I had to keep a hand on her almost the entire time to keep her from falling out of the booster. Our first born girl is now about to turn 5 & she has a baby brother who's 6 months old & it's time to retire the infant carrier. During our last visit, I inquired about a high chair. Surprisingly, after all these years, still not a single high chair has been brought in. I commented to the manager that we wouldn't be able to come in anymore if we don't have somewhere for our little guy to sit. His response I quote almost verbatim: ""The owner doesn't have a problem with families coming in, he just doesn't want to encourage it.""Absolutely speechless.On this last visit, sitting there eating, still blown away at what had just been communicated to us, in walks a family with a ""high chair"" aged child. The manager explained the ""only booster seat"" policy, watched the family stand there dumb founded for a few moments trying to figure out a way they might be able to work the seating out on their own. Then, defeat, and they left.Does the owner realize where he is? This is not some hoity toity restaurant in downtown. This is in a strip mall next to Subway & a guitar shop. This is a small neighborhood restaurant. Is he aware of the demographic? With what we have spent in Bria over these 4 years...and to know that our business isn't valued because we decided to procreate is preposterous. By the way, we frequent many of the hoity toity restaurants that Nashville has to offer (Etch, Rolf & Daughters, City House, Husk) & they all have high chairs and welcome our family. Tonight, we found a new semi neighborhood restaurant that will scratch our Italian itch.

"8128 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37221",3.5,"This was my first visit to Bria and I will definitely be back.We bought a Groupon a year ago and have never made it in to use the deal.  We were finally able to join a couple of friends for dinner last night.  First let me say the reason I am not giving five stars is because of the poor reservation/hostess experience.  I want to get that out of the way and then I will move onto the positive stuff.  We had reservations for 7:00 p.m.  We did not get a table until 7:30 p.m.  In the 30  minutes that we were waiting, several people walked in after us and were given tables.  After this happened 5 or 6 times my friend approached the hostess and asked what was going on.  She explained that there was not a table for us yet and that the other people were being sat ahead of us because they had smaller or larger parties.  While I understand the smaller party excuse, the larger party excuse is crap in my opinion.  If you have a reservation for 4 people, they should be given a table for 6 BEFORE a table of 6 that walks in.  What is the point of making a reservation?  By 8:00 p.m. the place had all but cleared out so apparently we were trying to get a table at peak time.Also, as a side note.  We did see a highchair sitting by the front door.  I noticed other reviewers complaining about the lack of child seats.  However, just because they have a child seat, that is not necessarily a good reason to bring kids here.  This place definitely has an adult atmosphere.  I saw one child, probably age 10.  Otherwise, it was all adults.  I mean, the bar is the focal point of the restaurant.  And while we were in jeans, most everyone else was pretty dressed up.  And it is a little pricey.Now, on to the good stuff.  Once we got a table, the service was fantastic.  Our server was great.  He was very knowledgeable and gave great advice on food and drinks.  We had fried mozzarella (very good, but small portion) and the antipasto plate (great selection) to start.  The bread and olive oil were fine.  I have seen other yelpers complaining, but everyone in our group liked it.  Both guys in our party had lasagna.  I had a bite and it was great.  It was finished in an individual pan, topped with cheese and heated.  The portion was HUGE.  Neither were able to finish it.  The third person had chicken picatta.  I did not taste it, but she said it was really good.  She also was not able to finish hers and took home leftovers.  I had the pork osso bucco.  It came with roasted vegetables and mushroom risotto.  It was very good.  The meat was fall off the bone tender, seasoned perfectly.  The meat was a little fatty, but I think that should be attributed to the cut, not the restaurant.  I just cut the fat off and set it to the side.  No big deal.  We did not have dessert, but we did have several cocktails.  The liquor is reasonably priced.  $7.50 for Jack Daniels.  The wine was a little overpriced.  Sonoma Cutrer ($24.00/bottle at the store) was $61.00.  The Show Chardonnay ($15.00/bottle at the store) was $11.00/glass.  We split the bill down the middle and it was $85.00/couple, plus tip, which is very reasonable for what we ate/drank.All in all it was a great experience and I think we will go back.  In the future, we will probably try to avoid weekends or make a reservation a little later than 7:00 p.m.",Bria Bistro Italiano,6156468274.0,16.0,2015-02-28,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bria-bistro-italiano-nashville,4.0,54,"Washington, DC",Jenn S.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.1622296,-86.774353,566.7091028370305,False,3372.0,3.5,3.0,3.519230769230769

"8128 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37221",3.5,"Bria Bistro is one of those places that you'll either love, or you'll feel it just isn't quite your style.  If I were to try to summarize it in a sentence, I would say that folks who claim to have a refined palate and enjoy ""upscale Italian"" food would enjoy this place -- whereas those whose expectations for Italian food are more in line with what you'd find at, say, the Olive Garden (or to be more charitable, a place like Amerigo's), might find the flavors and prices at Bria to be not their cup of tea.Lured by a Groupon I'd bought a couple months back, my girlfriend and I went to Bria Bistro on Friday night.  We knew that they had half price bottles of wine on Sunday and Wednesday nights (which, for the record, is absolutely when you should go), but as we were celebrating an award she'd gotten, we picked a relatively inexpensive ($32-ish) bottle of the house Pinor Noir that wasn't half bad.As we sipped on the wine and had some of the complimentary bread (served alongside olive oil with a mixture of spices), we had a chance to look at the decor.  If I were to say Bria has a bit of an identity crisis, that would sound far more negative than I intend it to be -- but there is a lot going ""on"" with the scenery.  When you first enter the restaurant, the bar area catches your eye, and it was obvious there were a handful of regulars there.  Like many places, the kitchen is open and visible, including the fire oven, and that's an aesthetic I personally like.  The walls are painted a shade of maroon, and you'll find various oil paintings for sale on them.  The ceiling is of the modern industrial type, with the ductwork painted but visible.  All in all, there's a lot going on.We picked out a couple appetizers -- the carne foccacce (that's a flatbread that's similar to a pizza if you're Italian-challenged like me) and arancini (fried rice balls, with goat cheese and other things).  Pretty much anything fried wins in my book, and these were great.The entrees were pretty interesting.  I picked the veal saltimbocca.  The veal was very tender and excellently prepared, and the flavors in the mushroom marsala jus were extremely rich.  Of all the things we ordered, this was my far my favorite, and I'm glad to have paid the up-charge to get veal ($24) instead of chicken ($19).She ordered the pappardelle pasta with shrimp.  This dish probably gets my award for the most uniquely-flavored pasta I've ever had -- but with a catch.  Made with mushrooms, arugula, goat cheese, and leeks, it's got a good combination of flavors -- but the twist comes from the addition of white truffle oil.  Truffle oil is, I think, one of those things you like or you don't, and the same goes for its smell.  Personally, I find the smell to be a little nauseating.  If you like truffle oil, you'll love this dish; if you don't (or if you aren't sure), you might stick with a safer choice.Overall, would I go back again?  Yeah.  Is that just because my girlfriend bought a Groupon too?  No.  It's just one of those places for which you need to be in the right frame of mind.  The food was good and unique, and the portions weren't tiny.  I'll try some new things next time, and will be sure to go on half-price wine night!",Bria Bistro Italiano,6156468274.0,62.0,2010-11-11,"Washington, DC",/biz/bria-bistro-italiano-nashville,3.0,54,"Washington, DC",Brian S.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,38.8949549,-77.03664559999999,1.3688331711774772e-12,True,3246.0,3.5,3.0,3.519230769230769

We counted about 18 tops to about 5 servers, 1 manager, 2 hostesses and 3 expediters, so were figured service would be great (plus what we read in the other reviews). Well we sat for about 10 minutes before anyone noticed us and brought us water. At that time the waiter stated that ""the waitress that handles your table has been in the bathroom for a while"". Gee thanks for that information. About 10 minutes later he came back and said he was going to help us even though this wasn't his section. We ordered drinks and heard about the specials. He came back to deliver the bread and drinks then disappeared for another 10 minutes. When he eventually came back he said ""sorry but because were not in his section he forgot about us""...Gee thanks again. We placed our order and off he went. The house salad was decent and brought to our table pretty quick. We felt better until he came back as we were finishing our salad and asked what we would like to order...Huh? He said ""he forgot what we ordered"". We waited again - now it was becoming a joke. Since the kitchen/bar spills into the dining area we could see our food sitting....just sitting...still sitting...finally a different server asked the manager whose it was and our waiter ran over after looking at us with our bare table. He brought our food and apologized again. The GOOD - The flatbread was actually really good. If I lived in the area I would venture back to sit at the bar and try the flatbread again.The BLAH - On the first visit to any Italian restaurant I always go for the lasagna. I figure if they know how to make flavorful lasagna they know what they are doing. If not - not worth going back. While the portion was big, it was bland - almost frozen lasagna meal bland. A couple of interesting things....First in a review here they said that they bake the bread. When we mentioned that we thought the bread was a little stale from being freshly baked he said that they buy it from Provence and nothing is done in house. When we overheard the table next to us ask about the Tiramisu the waiter said they get it from a local pastry chef in Nashville. When we asked our waiter about it he said they get it from Whole Foods. Bottom line is service was terrible, food was blah at best and they need to get their facts straight about their food.

I love me a proper hoagie.Since there's no Jersey Mike's near me, I've been going to Subway and trying to figure out how to get a sandwich that tastes that good, and I'm always disappointed. No, I don't want it heated. No, I don't want mayo or mustard, and yes, I asked you to put the oil and vinegar right on the bread. I'm always disappointed but at least it's cheap. So today I stopped in to Jersey Mike's and was surprised to see the meat being sliced fresh for sandwiches, and that ""Jersey Mike style"" means lettuce, tomatoes and oil and vinegar. The meat was quality, and the cheese was actual cheese (Subway, do you really think that we believe those little half-circles are actual provolone cheese? I think not.)I got the Italian. They told me the bread dough is actually made in NJ and baked on premises. It tasted great. That was one awesome sandwich. Now, if they only had Tastycakes, and I could top off my meal with a jelly krimpet, it would be perfect.

"4326 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"I am sorely tempted to refer to Moe's as ""Meh's"" since my dining experience here was pretty underwhelming. The only thing saving it from the dreaded two-star rating is because of all the Mexican fastfood chains I've visited, this one is definitely the most veggie friendly, offering Tofu as one of the protein options. It's nice to see a place that sees vegetarian food as something more than just the absence of meat in all of their regular dishes.But the food itself just felt kind of lackluster. Maybe it's because we came in about 45 minutes before closing, but the atmosphere was just kind of dead and the food seemed kind of limp and far from fresh. My husband and I split an order of the nachos, and while I really appreciate that Moe's lets you pick and choose whatever toppings you like, the end result looked like something that had just been haphazardly slapped together by the guy behind the counter (not visually appetizing). I make better looking nachos at home, I'm afraid to say. Plus, while we opted to add on tofu to our nachos, I was a bit disappointed to find the tofu lukewarm and flavorless. Honestly, nothing but the pickled jalapeños tasted like much of anything. Also, the chips are apparently made fresh each day, but they really tasted like the super cheap tortilla chips you buy at the grocery store. Finally, the prices seem kind of high for what you get... $3 - $4 for a taco? Maybe I could see ordering them à la carte if they were  less than $2 apiece, but at that price point, it ain't gonna happen. Our nachos came to $10.50, which also seems a bit expensive when all is said and done.I really wanted to like this place.

"2509 Lebanon PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"For more than a decade I have enjoyed Fat Mo's. I'm always satisfied with my enormous burger. The Donelson location has been particularly good over the last year or so that I've frequented that location, but I've been happy eating from many, many locations all over Nashville. Mo's makes my favorite burger, period.Here's what you should know about some of the other comments from reviews listed here. I base this on eating at Mo's for more than a decade as my waistline can attest. Going there once, posting pictures and calling it dogfood is incorrect.1) Yes, their locations are often repurposed old fast food restaurants. Personally, I'm happy to see a building being used as opposed to vacant and I'm always happy to find a Mo's. At this point, after years of frequenting Mo's, a brand new building would just feel too weird. Their food has never been suspect and I have never felt the old buildings were a danger to my health. 2) It's turkey bacon. The owners of Fat Mo's are from Iran. Lovely people, I've met one of them. Guess what? Theres no pork products on their menu. There's a reason for that. If you don't like turkey bacon (I've always thought it was fine, but I'm not a bacon nut) ask them to leave it off. They're happy to do special orders.3) If I were to give them some constructive criticism, it would be their menu is a little busy. Their locations have had the same over-choked menu for years and that must mean people eat all kinds of items from a Mo's. I have strayed and enjoyed their fried chicken sandwich on occasion but am content to eat burgers from a burger place.4) I find their patties to be well seasoned and juicy. I have never had a bland burger from Mo's. They use some kind of mediterranean spice mix. The flavor of their meat has been second to none..to my taste. I have never recieved cold food from Mo's.5) Most important! It takes them time to make your food. They do not make burgers and have them sitting under lamps waiting to throw in bags. I have waited in the drive through for 15 minutes or more for large orders. I am fine with this. I will wait for good food.

"2509 Lebanon PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"Decided to give Fat Mo's a try. The restaurant is located in what looks like an old KFC maybe? We didn't go inside, but instead used the drive thru. The drive thru menu is located at the back of the building. There isn't an order box there. You have to look over the menu & then drive around to the pickup window to place your order. At the order/pickup window they also have the picture of the combos they have available. I decided on the ""Fat Mo's deluxe"" that is touted as 16 ounces. It comes with mushrooms, onions, cheese, ""bacon"", lettuce, ketchup & maybe other stuff. I ordered no onions & spicy fries & a diet Pepsi. The combo is $9.99. The woman working the drive thru window was fast and efficient, but not very friendly. It took about ten minutes get the food.  We drove home, which is about 7 minutes away and got the food out of the to go container. The weight of burger and fries was a LOT. I actually weighed my burger and it was 19 ounces! I had to cut it in half and eat only half at first. The seasoned fries were good, but just tasted like the regular kind of frozen fries you can buy at the grocery store. The deluxe burger: this thing is massive. Like I said, I weighed it and it 19 ounces. The burger is two large patties. The patties are thick, and look to be preformed patties. They have been peppered, but other than that they don't have much seasoning or flavor. The mushrooms were from a can. The ""bacon"" is not bacon. It might look like bacon but it's some type of preformed, smoked meat item to simulate bacon. It looks like the Beggin' Strips that people feed dogs. I had to take the ""bacon"" off the burger. Overall I wasn't that impressed with Fat Mo's. The burger was large, yes, but there wasn't anything special about it. The ""bacon"" was gross. Would I go back again?

"421 Union StNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"Last week Steve and I were heading to TPAC for a show and wanted to grab some dinner on the way. Koto Sushi Bar is located downtown and just a few blocks away from the theater, so we decided to give it a go.When we arrived we were seated right away, but within 10 minutes the place filled up with people going to see the same show. There appeared to be only one waitress for all the tables and I felt bad for her because that's just way too many customers for one lady. Probably because of this, the service was slow. Later on in the evening a different lady came out from the kitchen to help with the rush of customers.The night was cold so for starters we ordered some hot sake and a pickle plate. The pickles took a very long time to arrive at our table, considering they are cold and just have to be plopped on the plate. Because of the odd timing the sake arrived way before the pickles. Oy. Anyway, the pickles themselves were quite enjoyable. They had a good crunch and strong vinegar flavor.For dinner we ordered four rolls: Dragon roll, Yummie roll, crunchy shrimp, and the salmon skin roll. I also ordered some sea urchin because I love the stuff. When the food came I was slightly disappointed right off the bat. Appearance and presentation is an integral part of the sushi dining experience, but their rolls were just NOT PRETTY. It appeared that they took no time in making their sushi look delightful and perfect. The rolls looked mangled and the pieces were all different sizes. One sea urchin looked pretty and one was horribly ugly and kept falling over. The end pieces on all of the rolls were also ugly and did not contain much filling at all.Besides the presentation, the sushi was just ok. It didn't wow me but it was passable. The salmon skin was over cooked making it very hard in spots. I felt like the crab topping on the Yummie roll needed something else: mayo, spice, avocado? Just something. The only thing that Steve and I agreed on was that the crunchy shrimp was quite good.Overall, I wasn't impressed with Koto. But its downtown location and proximity to the theater, arts district and broadway is pretty hard to beat when looking for a decent (non-touristy, non-chain) place to eat downtown.

Both rolls were crunchy and combined a delightful mixture of flavors that were, at first challenging, and finally extremely satisfying.The owners of the establishment have operated Koto in various locations over the course of 27 years and were wonderful to talk to (he is from Okinawa, Japan - she is from Korea.)  They were attentive and pleasant and our server was quick with the sake and other items that we desired.  Be sure to have a good look at the Chinese Koto hanging on the wall opposite the sushi bar.  It's an amazing piece of musical architecture and, as a musician, it was all I could do to keep from reaching out to pluck its long strings.  The only thing Koto is missing would be someone jamming out on THAT thing instead of the television hanging in the corner broadcasting whatever it was that it was broadcasting.  That's the reason for the four stars - the food was exquisite, as was the service and company.  The atmosphere would've been a bit more magical without the intrusion of that omnipresent television set.Still, worth a visit, we'll be back again next time we're in Nashville.",Koto Sushi Bar,6152558122.0,116.0,2011-07-26,"Orlando, FL",/biz/koto-sushi-bar-nashville,4.0,70,"Washington, DC",Bing F.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,28.5421175,-81.3790462,755.8243190989905,False,2136.0,3.7,3.5,3.7058823529411766

I've had some really great sushi and some really terrible sushi, and koto was neither - it was good, enjoyable but not the best and definitely not the worst.

"421 Union StNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"We all know that my heart belongs to Samurai when it comes to sushi, but every now and then I feel like trying something new just to make sure there aren't any other tastier fish in the sea. Walking into Koto feels a lot like what I would imagine it feels like to walk into a charming little sushi bar in Japan. The place isn't very big, and the decorations definitely give off a quaint Japanese vibe, though not in a cheesy way. The atmosphere is really nice, and the only thing that detracts from the ambiance is the tv they have up on the wall, which seems unnecessary and is a bit of a mood killer. Also, I definitely noticed a distinct ""fish"" smell when we walked in, and while it wasn't enough to deter us, I have to say that it was a bit offputting because I've never noticed this issue with any of the other sushi places I've tried in Nashville. Given that so many people have praised how fresh the fish is here, I was a surprised by the pungent odor, but I have to say that despite the scent, we had no issues with the freshness or quality of our meal.Another thing that surprised me was how CHEAP the food was! Most of the rolls were in the $4 range, and even the appetizers were very reasonable. We got an order of gyoza, and for $4 and some change, we got six succulent dumplings. As for the rolls themselves, I did NOT feel like the selection was very interesting or creative: most rolls were just one kind of fish wrapped in nori and rice with some avocado, cucumber, egg, burdock root, or scallions. Nothing wrong with this because the flavors were very clean and the simple ingredients really let the ingredients shine. BUT if you're used to places that put fruit in their sushi or have 5 or 6 ingredients in each roll, you might find the choices here a bit pedestrian and underwhelming. I did feel that while the flavors were really good here, part of why the rolls might be less expensive is because they are definitely on the smaller side and they do include fewer ingredients. Also, visually, they weren't as appealing or impressive as the sushi at Samurai - the rolls didn't seem as cleanly executed, and even our spider roll didn't have the visual impact of the one at Samurai (no little soft-shell crab legs peeking out to look like spider legs!). I have a feeling that the sushi here might be more authentic (not having had sushi in Japan, I can't say), so I think it might be unfair to compare it to a place like Samurai; both places are very good in their own rights, they just do different things. I was definitely excited to see that under their nigiri options that they had lots of unusual options listed that are very traditional but are generally not offered at most Japanese restaurants in town. Unfortunately, when I tried to order the toro (fatty tuna) I was told they were out, and that apparently they might not have that any more. Some other people tried to order various items and were also told they didn't have them... in that case, I think it might make more sense to have a specials board where you list what options are available daily for nigiri to minimize ordering disappointment! We had to swap in unagi (eel) instead, and it was really delicious, but I had my heart set on the tuna!Although Koto sushi didn't change my mind about my favorite spot for sushi in Nashville, it still was a solid dining experience, and I could definitely see coming here on nights when I didn't feel like braving the crowds at Samurai. It's a different style of sushi and a different vibe, so for those looking to compare the two, just know that they could not be more different! (About the only thing the two have in common is bad parking options!) Using that as my baseline I would say that I found Koto's sushi to be less exciting and original, but most rolls were about half the price of the rolls at Samurai  (but maybe smaller portions as well). Koto also appears to offer other Japanese fare apart from sushi, so perhaps the next time I'm craving tempura or some udon, I'll check this place out!",Koto Sushi Bar,6152558122.0,136.0,2012-02-03,"Toronto, Canada",/biz/koto-sushi-bar-nashville,3.0,70,"Washington, DC",Steph H.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,43.6529206,-79.3849008,350.3224729993701,False,4030.0,3.7,3.5,3.7058823529411766

I have been meaning to try it for quite some time as I am a huge sushi fan. I lived in Los Angeles for 10 years and was very spoiled with the vast array of excellent sushi restaurants from which I would partake 3-5 times per week.The atmosphere at Koto is quite nice. It feels cozy with nice traditional decor with a slightly modern twist. It offers a decent choice of intimate booths, tables or sushi bar seats to choose from. Everything appeared to be well maintained and clean, including the bathrooms. Staff was attentive and friendly, but not overly so.My visit was during peak lunch time. The place was comfortably full, but I had no problem sliding up to the sushi bar. I ordered the lunch special for $8.95 which included salad, miso soup, white rice and a crunchy shrimp roll. I added shrimp/veggie tempura for $.75 extra. Overall, the quality and amount of food was good -- a solid sushi lunch special for the money. I also ordered the unsweet iced tea and it was good, brewed tea. I am picky about my tea. Some places serve rancid tasting tea or pre-made stuff.I did however experience one major  issue. As soon as I walked in the door, a major allergy attack was triggered. I began sneezing incessantly, my nose began to run and my eyes started itching like crazy. I looked around and noticed that they had several fans (the kind you use to dry wet floors) blowing air around the restaurant. Over the sushi bar is a decorative roof, and the ceiling is paneled with rice paper. Since we are coming off of a major allergy season, I am thinking there may be allergens and dust piled up on the roof and rice paper which the fans are circulating all around the restaurant. I got back to the office and have been miserable the rest of the day with the worst allergy attack I have had in quite some time. I think my clothes and body are still covered with whatever was in the restaurant. I can't wait to get home and take a shower. I would recommend that they deep clean all of their decor, turn off the fans and run an air purifier to clean out the allergens in that place.Overall, the food and service were good for a sushi restaurant in Nashville.

"2914 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",2.5,"My apologies to the Beatty Denny's, the only other restaurant I have given a one-star review thus far. They served terrible food, for sure, but at least it could be called food. This place served, optimistically, the residue of alien life forms.One thing you need to know up front is that I made two key mistakes prior to coming here. First, I ignored the bad-to-mediocre reviews of this place on every site because of its alluringly dirt-cheap prices. Second, more importantly, I chose to believe that the  gross, off-color photos of various dishes were a result of poor photography, and that the real dishes would be at least acceptable. That has certainly been the case at other cheap restaurants. My optimism persisted at the counter, where a friendly lady told me that my Chicken Chow Mein (I know, I was really pushing the culinary limits with this one) lunch special, complete with fried rice and wanton soup, was a mere $5.19 including tax. Wow! Unfortunately, I didn't compute the true cost of $7.38 since I failed to incorporate the cost of the 2 McDoubles I had to order later after I threw most of my food in the garbage.So, in a relatively timely fashion, the lady brings out a plate of food items, with everything in concealing styrofoam packaging. I began with my soup, which was mediocre at best and had a strange aftertaste. It was a solidly two-star, uninspiring dish, but at least it was edible and more or less what I was expecting at a place like this. Then, I opened the main package, and...dear lord! I ordered chicken, but I don't know which planet is rearing oyster-textured, gray-blue-fleshed chicken. The ""chicken"" was laid playfully in a bed of oversized chunks of celery, probably the least vegetable-y of all vegetables. The fried ""rice"" (again, I assume this was some extraterrestrial cereal lazily trying to pass as rice) was bright yellow with irregularly-shaped grains. I took one small bite of the chicken and, after managing to avoid throwing up, re-sealed the box, carried it down the street one block, and threw it into the trash. I had considered passing it along to a local homeless person, but no human being would deserve this. Needless to say, I will not be a repeat customer.

"2914 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",2.5,"I grew up eating Americanized Chinese food, despite having lived near Oakland Chinatown and San Francisco Chinatown. I have tried authentic Chinese, but I make a distinction between the 2 cuisines, considering the former as comfort food.I *always* find something to eat.My go-to dish is sweet and sour pork. And then I would try the other sweet meat dishes (orange or lemon chicken, BBQ spare ribs).  But I noticed that this place had a dish I've never seen before: ""boneless"" ribs.So, for my first foray here, I asked for that. I was impressed that it really was boneless. I don't know if it's this area that prefers no bones in the ribs; I certainly never saw it in the numerous Americanized Chinese restaurants I've frequented over the years. I loved it -- if mainly because I got twice the meat because there were no bones!The meat was dry, though. But, I actually expected that to happen for this dish. The fat was not as prevalent; the reason I like the fat is that it balances out the dryness of the meat. Perhaps they will honor my request for ""more fat"".The egg roll was okay. They give a lot of duck sauce and soy-less soy sauce.I have since tried their sweet and sour pork. I hate to say that it was not very good. There are many variations of sweet and sour pork; this place batters its pork (I have tried this version and others that just fries them plain). The sauce was too sweet for even my palate. And I forgot to request steamed rice. Having fried rice was too rich for me -- I've never seen yellow-colored fried rice before.I admit that this was also the first time I've seen a non-Chinese person working the cashier. I've seen non-Chinese at Panda Express, but I don't consider their food to be Chinese at all. The seating was mainly booths, and reminded me of a fast food place with the yellow walls.

"Pop-Up RestaurantNashville, TN",5.0,"Chico ate my homework. Okay. Well... I think we all know that I'm lying but I just had to attempt to find an excuse on why my adoring review of pop-up restaurant Buttermilk Road is just now being posted. What is Buttermilk Road, you ask? This is what proprietor and chef extraordinaire Lisa Donovan has to say:""Buttermilk Road Sunday Supper is a pop-up restaurant based in Nashville, Tennessee that is meant to celebrate the tradition of the community-family Sunday feasts.""I digress a bit and note that while it is certainly all that she describes, it is also just so much more than that too...Last November, I was lucky enough to secure a spot for the ""back to nature"" vegetarian supper that was hosted at East Nashville darling Barista Parlor. For a suggested $80 donation, I enjoyed 4 courses of innovative yet thoughtfully prepared cuisine, carefully curated cocktails and beverages, and satisfying appetizers while enjoying breaking bread (a Pain Brie Normandie at that!) with a small community of culinary aficionados. The casual elegance of Barista Parlor was the perfect platform for Lisa and her team to build a beautiful evening filled with the fragrant scent of scrumptious sustenance and undeniable charm. Many milled around the space and mingled while sipping on the Hot Apple Cider that was concocted of Lairds Apple Jack Brandy and Prichard's Tennessee Whiskey. Although, I knew that I should pace myself due to the bountiful courses ahead of me, I couldn't resist nibbling on the appetizers that were laid out. The Crostini with Eggplant Caponata and Fried Cippolini Onions was dangerously tasty while the Wild Mushroom Pate with Cumin Marinated Olives and Pain de Campagne still resonates with my taste buds. I'm a vegan so I passed on the Cheese Selection but I did thoroughly enjoy the Fresh Figs and Quince.And, to think... those were just the appetizers. I had contacted Lisa ahead of time to thank her for organizing a vegetarian themed supper as I was literally salivating at the opportunity to attend one of her events. Some of my friends were just raving on and on about how incredible their experiences were at a supper hosted at Burger Up while others were literally gloating about The Catbird Seat edition that was just a couple of weeks before. Lisa graciously replied that she would be happy to ""vegan-ize"" the menu for me and was as delightfully adorable as those revered little biscuits that she's known for.Throughout the evening, I couldn't help but smile as familiar faces were both sitting at the long rustic tables and also scooting out of the kitchen to giddily serve fine fare to the diners. I can't honestly think of another occasion where I was itching to join a kitchen or event crew in preparing and serving others. Perhaps, it was the intoxicating mulled wine but I'm certain the real reason is that these passionate folks are ""sharing"" a truly beautiful experience and not just ""serving"" supper. The first course consisted of Warm Asparagus Salad with Arugula, Walnut Vinaigrette and Poached Farm Fresh Egg but again, Lisa and Co. were able to alter this dish for me and I was more than satisfied with the tweak. The lust-worthy Buckwheat Crepe comprised of Housemade Ricotta, Roasted Fennel, Leeks, Romesco Sauce, and Fried Green Spanish Olives was a flavorful second course. The combination of the sauce and Spanish Olives burst with flavor. For the third course, one of my favorite beans was featured front and center with Artichoke, Pepper, and Chickpea Tagine served with Preserved Lemon, Chermoula, and Housemade Harissa. Seriously, it just doesn't get much better than that folks. We all know what is next... the final course. Hello, dessert! Along with cupping local favorite, Drew's Brew Coffee Service, we savored a Maple Cream Panna Cotta with Caramelized Pears and Oatmeal Crumble. My, oh, my. Lisa's extensive experience as a renowned pastry chef (with pedigreed stints at Margot, City House, and now Husk) really shine here. Her desserts aren't an afterthought of saccharine or fluff but instead has brought baking and ""sweets"" to a whole 'notha level.The evening ended nearly as magical as it started with many lingering around for a bit to bond and chatter about the wonderful circumstances that brought us all together to share such an intimate supper together. With Lisa's new role at Husk and the rising popularity of Buttermilk Road in other markets that have beckoned this pop-up to hit the road (a Southern Baking Class was hosted recently hosted in NYC), my only concern is that BR will start to resemble the well-intended family who initially dined together while sharing funny stories and playing games... However, as work deadlines loom and the kids grow up, these frequent meals become exclusive only to holidays or special occasions. I hope that the Buttermilk Road is a tradition that will live on at the dinner table and beyond.TIP: BR can also be commissioned to cater and plan private events too!",Buttermilk Road Sunday Supper,,798.0,2013-08-17,"Nashville, TN",/biz/buttermilk-road-sunday-supper-nashville,5.0,1,"Washington, DC",Marcia M.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.1622296,-86.774353,566.7091028370305,False,4974.0,5.0,,5.0

First she changed the item from what it's supposed to be, stated that it was pleasing to her, then added more good opinions and descriptions, but finally gave a 3 star review? o_0Both El Tapatio locations offer very similar quality. I first visited both locations 3 years ago and had disappointing experiences. I recently tried both locations again and the quality of the food has skyrocketed (both places). The quality of food is very similar to my favorite Mexican food in Nashville (Taqueria Express food trucks). El Tapatio is essentially a food truck that parks next to a vacant small building that they lease. The small building acts like a dining area, while the food truck acts like the kitchen.I ordered a variety of items to sample their asada (beef), pastor (spicy pork), and pollo (chicken). The asada is juicy and relatively flavorful, similar to the asada at Taqueria Express. The pastor is spicy, flavorful, and juicy. The quality of the pastor is high, similarly to Taqueria Express, but the flavor is very different than Taqueria Express (not good, not bad, just different). It's still very delicious.The chicken here is not as flavorful as the chicken found at Taqueria Express. However what it lacks in juiciness and flavor, it gains in the grilled flavor. I'm not entirely sure if they cook the chicken on an open flame, but it sure tastes like they do. And this is the one department where the chicken is better here than at Taqueria Express. I would not hesitate coming back here. The quality is on the same level as the Taqueria Express food trucks (best in Nashville). Then again, El Tapatio, this location at least, is essentially a food truck with an indoor dining area. Prices here are slightly higher than a regular food truck because they rent/lease space for a dining area.

Chips come out immediately. Salsa is just OK and has no heat whatsoever. Ask for some hot sauce. The menu is extensive and includes chicken, beef, and pescado dishes and even combination options. I got the chicken enchiladas. It was kind of odd to me that really it was cheese enchiladas with the chicken on TOP of them and then smothered in the red sauce. I am used to just putting the chicken and cheese inside the enchilada and doing it that way so it was odd. I put some hot sauce on it and made it much better.But the SUPERSTAR of the lunch, truly, was the chorizo cheese dip. So this is like your queso but with real honest to God chorizo in it. It was SPICY. It was GREASY (in a good way). The chorizo made me warm and happy. It was like for a small second I was back in TEXAS. Oh man, it was good. So I proceeded to top my enchiladas with this and then was a happy camper. Service was good, we were there at an off time so not a lot of competition. They have a big roomy bar there so I could see people sitting there getting their drink on after work during happy hour. Extra bonus that I was eavesdropping on the wait staff talking to each other and, thanks to my Duolingo Spanish app, I could pick up on some of what they were talking about.So when you go, just get your tacos or enchiladas or burritos or whatever you are getting, then get an order of this chorizo cheese dip, slather it on your food, and go to town!

"3454 Percy Priest DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"This was my first (and likely last) Cracker Barrel visit, and clearly, they didn't get their reputation based on the kind of breakfast my friend and I had yesterday. No way... or are all of those gitchy country knick-knacks blurring the tastes of their diners?Problem: food items like grits and gravy that sit too long before being served will develop a thick layer of film over the top of them when they aren't stirred. Liquid gluten turning into a solid. This is a natural occurring problem you can experience at home just as easily. So when the order comes to the table and there's a bowl of each and you have to poke through it with a fork to get to the source then you know its been sitting *in that bowl* for some time. In other words, these bowls were pre-filled then sat until our order came along. Kind of gross. I'd guess these had been bowled up as many as 10-15 minutes ahead of time which is unacceptable. No one in the back was on watch. Hello, supervisor?The country ham had an unusual amount of barnyard to the taste. Not sure what was going on there. I buy plenty of cured ham both from stores like Kroger and small local custom butchers (blue collar and prissy pants, there ya go). Something a little strange was going on with our cuts (we had the same meal). The eggs and cheesy hash browns, those were darn fine, and the coffee was sort of the truck-stop grade I'd expect. No complaints, just not my thing. The biscuits were hard on the bottom, difficult to cut with a fork. Guess from a lot of years of cooking: sitting since very early a.m. in a warmer and got cooked twice. Nothing difficult to figure out there.So, I finally experienced the Cracker Barrel. Can't say I'd come back and was only here because my friend is a big fan, but even he agreed (he's eaten at dozens) not one of their better efforts.Oh, kudos to the two nice young ladies that served us.

Tonight we had planned on going to waffle house, and on a whim changed our minds due to the simple fact that my husband always caters to my wishes and I decided to take one for the team. My two kids whined when they heard we were not going to waffle house but we were able to calm their nerves letting them know they could get pancakes. We walked in and immediately my 3 year old has to pee so we take a family bathroom break before even being seated. The restrooms were extremely clean, no exaggeration here. I wouldn't classify myself as a full blown germ-a-phobe however I am the woman who makes my dancing toddler hold her bladder even longer while I squirt my hand sanitizer onto the toilet seat and wipe it down before she sits. I did NOT feel the need to do that in this restaurant because everything looked like it had just been cleaned and disinfected. No water puddles on the sink counter, and to top it all off the locks on the stalls had rubber coatings on them to prevent squeaking and scraping noises. Now that might not be so important, but it impressed the heck out of me and made me smile. OK OK, on to the good stuff. The hostess proceeded to seat us and when I asked to be seated against the wall he happily guided us to the wall. Again may not sound important, but I have an anxiety disorder that puts me in fits if seated in the center of a room and have been told at other restaurants that I could not be seated anywhere but the center, or given extreme attitude when requesting a different table as if it physically pained the person seating me. This was not the case here, he barely even blinked about it and was happy to seat me somewhere else. So we sit down and our waitress comes over within about 3 minutes, she takes our drink orders and explains to me that they are under staffed and running a little behind. She PRE-APOLOGIZES for any wait we may have. We could clearly see they were very busy compared to the amount of servers on hand. However she was back with our drinks in just a few minutes and took the time to explain some menu questions I had and did not behave in a rushed manner when doing so. We ordered our food and I had a lot of specific requests, due to my disdain for black pepper and my odd pregnancy cravings. She was very friendly about everything and repeated my order when I was done to make sure she got it all right, then she went above and beyond and told the cook in person about my pepper issue to be certain it was cooked to my liking. The wait was better than average especially for being busy and under staffed, we waited about 15  minute and that is pushing it to a rough estimate. While we waited she brought my kids crayons which the hostess forgot, and even brought an extra pack which they were happy about. The eating area of the restaurant was just as clean as the bathrooms were. I mean, I really do not think I have ever seen such sparkling tables and floors in an eating establishment. Out came the food and this is usually when I regret coming to a cracker barrel... to my surprise everything was cooked to perfection with all of my ridiculous requests and not a hint of black pepper on anything but the gravy (which is pre cooked and she did explain that to me before hand, and I was ok with that) I ordered the country boy breakfast with a sirloin steak. My steak was moist and cooked precisely to my liking, as well as being flavorful and a generous portion of meat. Every single item was delicious. our server was Judy c. she was very sweet and honestly one of the best servers we have had in a long time, almost seemed maternal in her care for our family.AND FYI SHE HAD NO IDEA I WAS PREGNANT, so she was being genuine and not just worried about a hormonal breakdown. She kept apologizing for our wait in between table visits but she was so attentive you would have never known they were busy. So my point is I have been converted, I am officially a lover of Cracker Barrel like the rest of the southern people.

"2323 Elliston PlNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"True story: 2015 was the first time I had Jet's. I know! I am lucky to have a couple of great standalone pizza places a neighborhood or two over from mine and I'd dismissed Jet's as Pizza Hut-lite. And while, yes, Jet's is a large chain, they deliver solid pizza that satisfies on chilly Friday nights.I was in the area and frustrated with the wait and price for a quick in-and-out sushi grab (you can't throw a rock on this stretch of Elliston without hitting a sushi joint) so I decided to change it up and see what else was around. A quick search on the Yelp app revealed Jet's (as would have just looking up and using my eyes). Reviews were solid. I thought I'd give it a try. The young lady behind the counter was nice and very informative. I let her know this was my first time at Jet's and she broke down the various styles and choices for me. After some quick debate, my large, thin veggie was being worked on. The cost for this bad boy? $17. Not bad at all.I didn't have to wait too terribly long before my pie was ready. By the time I arrived home, I was ready to chow down. I opened the box and... yep, this was Midwest/Great Lakes thin crust pizza, alright. This is a good thing. As I tore in to my squares I thought to myself that I should have checked Jet's out a while ago. This was solid, tasty, well-constructed pizza. It's not artisan blah blah blah nor is it trying to be.

As I've said before, I'm really pretty picky when it comes to pizza - it's hard to make it so bad that it's inedible, but it's also really hard to do it justice. I would say that Jet's is one of the top three pizza joints in Nashville, because when you get down to it, their pizza is supremely tasty and satisfying.I've had all three crust options now (thin, hand-tossed, and deep-dish) and all are really yummy and vastly superior to your other chain pizza places. It's also nice that they have seasoning options for the crusts, so even those doughy bits are delicious and delightful. I think I huge sticking point for me when it comes to pizza is the sauce - I don't like too much of it, and I don't like it when it is too thick and too much like tomato paste. Jet's sauce is light and fresh-tasting and also kind of sweet; it gets no complaints from me. We always seem to get an order of Jet's bread as well, which is really just cheesy garlic bread and is totally superfluous. I mean, do I really need a side of bread with my slice of bread? Probably not, but it's so yummy, we can never resist. Just be warned that if you ask for a side of ranch with your bread, be sure to check when you pick it up because they ALWAYS screw up and give marinara instead!Prices are good here, and there are always tons of coupons and deals that you can get off their website. I'll just mention them when calling and have never actually had to produce one while picking up, so it's nice that they're happy to have their customers reap the deals over and over again.

As an out-of-towner, my boyfriend wanted me to check out his favorite restaurant here, which made it very hard for me to write this review because it's not a good review, but because it's his favorite and he has great memories here and I'm not taking that away from his experience. This is my own and it's directed more towards the establishment itself. Our drinks were AWESOME so props to the bartender who was super cool. The aesthetic is really nice and stays true to Japanese style. I really liked how it was decorated. It was clean, great atmosphere and the wait staff was really friendly and good. So why 2 stars? Well, because it seems unfair as a customer and good paying customer too, my combo of filet, scallops, shrimp and chicken was dominated by more vegetables than anything! I kid you not, 3 shrimps and 4 small scallops I counted and the filet was good and so was the chicken. It was a better portion. But quite STINGY on the seafood portion. I don't know about you all. I eat at a lot of different types of restaurants from the highest Michelin starred celebrated chef restaurants to other regular standard restaurants to hole in the walls, just ALL types with all calibur, and I was appalled at the portions at this restaurant. The only reason why this combo costed $30+ is due to the seafood but it lacked its main star on the plate. I could have ordered just the filet for a bit cheaper but I just had expectations that they would be more generous even on a combo like other hibachi restaurants I've been to. So, it's the principle of price and quantity. Is it worth the price for this food?? Not really. Prices also take into consideration on how much the leasing cost on the entire building and location that this restaurant is connected to and location is what you're paying for too.

So complaining to the manager wouldn't have solved anything because he can't make my food taste better.  I didn't want more seafood, I didn't want more of anything.

I just always HOPE that whatever business receives multiple negative reviews will pay attention and make the necessary changes.      To begin with, parking was an issue. We walked in to this dark room that absolutely reeked. And, I'm not talking the odor that permeates one's clothes after eating at a Japanese grill. I'm talking FOUL!  It immediately left me with an uneasy feeling about the place and what was to come. Although we had reservations, they sent us to wait in the lounge where we were forced to smell the stench for a solid 15-20 minutes. It was so dark, luckily I couldn't see the inevitable stains on the ""loungers""...but, the old decor, nasty smell, and lack of light just gave the place such a seedy feel! I wanted to leave immediately.       So, while waiting, I'm noticing others in this dark lounge, waiting for tables and one in particular that could not be missed due to the loud screams and cries coming from that direction. The child was not a happy camper. The pit in my stomach grew. When they called us to seat us, right after calling the crying child's family, I privately spoke with the hostesses (2 of them...one seemed to actually be a manager) and made them aware that we weren't up to be seated with  a cryng child. I asked them specifically if they were seating us with that child and they said ""no"". So, we followed the hostess, and then I see that everyone is being required to take their shoes off. UGH! This place was grossing me out enough...it's cold, the middle of December, I'm wearing knee high boots and have no desire start trying to yank my knee high boots off only to step all over whatever nastiness covers the various surfaces in there.       But, two in my party forged ahead. Keeping my boots on, I follow UNTIL I see that they are having us sit right next to the crying chld. Thank you, Kobe. What a Happy Birthday to me.      At that, I collected my family and left the table.

"210 25th Ave NNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"I visited Kobe tonight with a Restaurant.com card gift certificate (yes, I know that should have been a sign).  My experience begin exactly like the one described by Stacy B. (2/22/2015).  We did valet and had no issue leaving our car with the valet.  We later did have to wait for over 30 minutes to get our car from the valet; which was very frustrating.  When we entered there was an awful smell.  The facilities were very worn down.  Despite the fact that we had reservations, we had to wait over 30 minutes to be seated.  The lounge area was dark, but even with the lack of light it was apparent that the area suffered from neglect.  I am not a germ-a-phobe, but I was very uncomfortable sitting on the couches given the smell, texture and nasty film that seemed to cover everything.  I would have left immediately under any other circumstance, but this was my young daughter's ""dream"" place to eat so I bit my tongue and smiled.  When we were escorted to our table, we passed a large dryer fan perched on a table.  The kind of fans you see used for water damage.  This may have had something to do with the awful smell.  I was stunned by the condition of the restaurant that claimed to be a high-end Japanese Steak House.The table we were seated at was no exception to the poor condition I have described up until now.  The metal cooktop was not very clean and still had remnants of food from who knows when.  The metal was very warped and seemed long past its prime.  The large exhaust fans above the grills were very dirty and greasy looking too.  It looked like they have been repainted many times with thick and uneven coats of paint.  The light fixtures, walls, everything screamed to me that this place was falling apart.The service was adequate for a large casual dining chain restaurant, but certainly not up to par for a ""nice"" restaurant.The menu was in line with every other restaurant of this type I have visited.  I had the filet, scallops, shrimp, and chicken meal (decided to diversify my plate to increase the odds of getting something ""good"").The soup was a salty broth with a slice of mushroom and some pasta (bizarre).  The salad had bagged iceberg lettuce with some tomato slices and croutons.  But they must have remembered somewhere along the way that they were supposed to be ""Japanese"" so they put a ginger dressing on the salad.  As you may have inferred, the salad was lack-luster.The ""chef"" then came out to prepare our meal and entertain.  He smiled and said ""thank you"" a lot, but other than tapping the salt and pepper shakers against his spatula, there was no show.  In all fairness, he did also attempt the onion volcano, but it didn't really work out.  For those that have seen these ""shows"" before you'll appreciate that once he lit the volcano, he continued cooking the other items that were underway.  A minute or two later, he seemingly remembered that he didn't do the ""choo-choo train"" with the volcano (which never really lit on fire nor did it say stacked) and then tried to work the train back into the dinner.  However, I don't know that anybody understood at all that that was what he was trying to do.  I did have to laugh because it was such a ridiculous scene.As others have said, the food was bland, overcooked, and not of the highest quality.  Even the sauces were lackluster.  I will say that the orange sherbet was spot on.  It was a delightful ending to an otherwise disappointing experience.  It have obviously been pre-scooped, somewhat melted and then re-frozen in its dish; but it was the highlight of the night for me.Even with the Restaurant.com ""discount"", this was a very poor value.  This may be the first 1-star review I have given.  I highly recommend that you find another Japanese steakhouse if that's what you're looking for.",Kobe Steaks Japanese Restaurant,6153279081.0,7.0,2015-06-29,"Franklin, TN",/biz/kobe-steaks-japanese-restaurant-nashville,1.0,44,"Washington, DC",D B.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,35.1680139,-86.1084401,563.1786927308692,False,3831.0,3.022727272727273,,3.022727272727273

They were good but I've never seen a place that doesn't serve the standard hibachi noodles, which is one of my favorite parts.Then... the deal breaker by far for me was.... they don't have white sauce aka yum yum sauce aka the best and most standard part of any hibachi experience I've had.

"210 25th Ave NNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Straight off the plane from Kansas City, I was starved for some Asian food. My boyfriend and I were meeting a couple of our friends and they chose this restaurant claiming that it was a lot like Benihana. I was initially hesitant because places that put on a show usually means that the food is pretty mediocre but I figured it couldn't be that bad. I was surprised by how fancy this place portrayed itself to be. Valet parking and comfortable seats in the waiting area. My group and I removed out shoes and were led to the dining area. Kobe Steaks does provide the whole Teppanyaki experience complete with the chef doing fancy tricks and the classic onion rings on fire show. However, you're going to have to pay big bucks for it especially if you want their Kobe beef. My boyfriend went ahead and ordered the Kobe while I stuck to the Filet Mignon. I suggest ordering the smallest size because you're going to have a lot of sides that come with the steak. You're going to have to pay extra for the fried rice but it's worth it since you get enough to feed 2 people. I also really liked the stir fried vegetables, mushrooms, shrimp and bean sprouts that came with my meal but everything is one note. There is no extra or special seasoning at all. At places like this, one thing that MUST be cooked right is the meat. Thankfully, my filet mignon was cooked to perfection. It was super tender and juicy and delicious with all the sides. My boyfriend's Kobe was overcooked. What a disappointment considering how expensive it was. Our meal ended with a single scoop of green tea ice cream which was good but nothing special.

"210 25th Ave NNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"I have a warm place in my heart for Kobe.  It is the original Teppanyaki place in Nashville.  Apparently, I made my first trip when I was 9 months old and have been back many times since.  For a very long time my family had an annual tradition of going to Kobe on Christmas Eve because it was one of the few places open and was completely different from what we would be having the following day.  All my memories include tons of food, good times, and a nice warm feeling.  Now that I am all old and jaded I was curious if I would still enjoy a Christmas eve trip there.  I am happy to say that Kobe can still deliver on an entertaining evening.  There are some flaws.  The soup is extremely dumbed down to a point where it is not even recognizably Japanese, the rice is not very high quality, and the experience can vary pretty dramatically  depending on the chef.  Although, I have to admit the last point can make for a very surreal and amusing experience like the time our chef was Hispanic with a pretty heavy accent yet still doing the whole Japanese ketchup bit.  Very postmodern and the food was still good.Overall the food aims for a pretty safe place and hits its intended mark.  In my mind Kobe qualifies as comfort food so it gets a little extra slack.  It is a great place to go if you have family from out of town (especially if they are out of any town) that might not be that adventurous.  I would recommend splurging a bit on things like filet and scallops and ordering medium rare for the best experience.   Also, drinks certainly don't hurt the experience if you know what I mean. Most of all I guess the key is to just go with it.  Flaming onion volcanoes are still cool, food prepared in front of you is a very fun thing to see, and catching shrimp in a chef's hat is harder than it looks.Relax, eat some steak, and pretend you are not a jaded adult for a while, worked for me.",Kobe Steaks Japanese Restaurant,6153279081.0,214.0,2011-01-05,"Nashville, TN",/biz/kobe-steaks-japanese-restaurant-nashville,4.0,44,"Washington, DC",Ian R.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.1622296,-86.774353,566.7091028370305,False,1914.0,3.022727272727273,,3.022727272727273

I ended up having to go out that way anyway so decided to pop in and get my order to go. The first thing that threw me off was the girl at the front counter could barely understand what I was saying and I was having the same problem with her. I'm going to take a wild stab and say she was from Russia? She finally apologized, said she was new and couldn't answer questions and got someone else. It was only her and the one guy in the back who ended up running delivery. On their front counter they have a $5.00 off coupon from Grub Hub. After fooling around with that app for awhile I just gave up because the code they had didn't work and the employee said he couldn't offer the discount either. I finally placed my order with him and he told me no problem that it would be about 20 minutes. 20 minutes came and went. Both employees are in the back of the store. The phone was ringing off the hook and they were also getting notifications from Grub Hub and Yelp that they weren't attending to. At 30 minutes the delivery guy comes out and says my food is almost done and leaves to make his delivery. Still no employee comes out to the front and we're just sitting there twiddling our thumbs waiting. 40 minutes later I still don't have my food! I went to the counter and tried calling for the employees and nobody was answering. I finally knocked on the side door they have in their very tiny lobby and the first girl comes out apologizing saying that it's almost done. At this point I told her I'm considering cancelling my order. All I ordered was one calzone and spaghetti with meatballs. How does that take almost an hour to make especially when we're the only ones in the store and you're not even bothering to answer the phone to take more orders? Our food finally comes out and and the girl offered us a few sodas for our trouble. We don't drink soda so she replaced them with cheesecake instead, which is the only reason I'm giving them a 2nd star. The spaghetti tasted like it came right out of a can of Chef Boyardee.

I ordered a sushi roll as an appetizer and then a NY strip as my main course. The sushi was passable; the rice was a little bland for sushi rice, but the done-ness was correct and the fish was fresh. My strip was cooked properly, but the marbling left much to be desired. I paid prime beef prices for what was at best choice.

Then slather and pile on everything else that say's ''Hey! More napkins over here!"" or just enough for a genteel dab at the corners of your mouth. But you're not done. Just stay with the homemade potato chips because everyone understands you now (and the chips ARE that good.)Me?

We went for dinner at about 7:30 on a Saturday night and were able to sit right down - yay!   Tvs all around the room, and the Preds were on which was good. They boast a whole lotta beers on their menu. Hubby had one and seemed to enjoy it. I'm not a beer drinker, and unfortunately they don't have their liquor license, so I just had water. It would be nice if they offered shakes - I have teenage boys that LOVE shakes (ok, I love them too, when I let myself indulge).     We tried Bill's dills, the fried pickles, but didn't care for them. I think they need some perfecting. For dinner, we all had different burgers and were all very pleased. I am not a burger eater, really, but I had the sliders and they were delicious! The fries were good...my husband had onion rings and said they were good too.    So, overall, we are thrilled to have a new, locally-owned restaurant that seats and serves quickly.

Food was good - but one of the staff had their kid there (5 or 6 year old?) - who was hanging out being pretty loud. Sorry Murff's - not the atmosphere I'm expecting at a bar. The whole staff was hanging out together (kitchen+bar+servers) and seemed way more interested in the 5 year old than taking care of customers. When we walked in (with only one other table in the whole bar there at 8:30 on a Friday night) literally all 4 staff just stared at us - no one said Hi or offered us a table or said welcome. Management needs to work on that. How rude! We had to ask, after standing in a practically empty restaurant staring at 4 staff for about 30 seconds, if we should just grab ourselves a table. The whole meal was pretty much an extenuation of that initial experience. I imagine this is why the place was practically empty on a Friday night. I hope management works on their staff customer service - because they have good food!

We all have our preferences (Pharmacy, Five Guys, Burger Up, Smash Burger, In & Out...) but each of the 3 times, the buns either fell apart, were small or poorly baked, and in sum poor. d) Beer selection. Meh. The last time I ate there (took 5 friend) they were literally out of 5 beers. We ended up drinking bottled beer or soda. (Hardly a ""Craft Brew"" when you don't have any.)

If you go in one day and look at the pastries, the exact same ones will be there the next day. They are not fresh. What bakery has the stones to sell day old anything. I went in this morning and ordered 2 lox bagels with cream cheese and capers. I told the cashier to please go heavy on the capers. He said no problem. I ordered cheese grits as well. He then had to check if they had lox. He checked and said they were prepping it now. I sat and waited 15 minutes for them to prep two portions of lox, 2 raw bagels and cream cheese. They ran out of capers so I suggested they open a jar of the capers they had on sale. They did. They portioned out grits and I left, 20 dollars lighter. I got home and opened up the bagels. They looked wrong. They claimed to use Bagelface bagels but these were not Bagelface bagels. Please refer to the pictures I have uploaded. Compare them to the Bagelface bagels on their Yelp page. These were icy cold and doughy. 99% sure they are Lender's Bagels. The lox was revolting. Very little flavor beyond the distinctive taste of rotten fish. Grits were dry and tasteless. I called to voice a complaint and got a manager to call me back. I told him his bagels did not come from bagelface and his lox tasted like spoiled fish or catfood. He insisted the bagels were from Bagelface but offered a refund on the bagels. Then I said the grits were nasty so he offered a refund of the whole thing.

The chicken was too thick, overcooked and very stringy. There was no flavor to it and I ate maybe a couple bites.

Originally we had gone down the shopping center to Corner Pub but their hours are wrong on their website so we came here. I've been to this Brewhouse several times mostly to watch football. The last time I was there was the last straw after several weeks of receiving bad and rude service, but we put up with it because they were close and had the Sunday Ticket. The menu had been changed and updated which was nice to see. My eye immediately went to the Cajun burrito as I love all things burritos and tortillas and can never say no to a no traditional burrito. According to the menu it was shrimp and chicken jambalaya inside of a flour tortilla with andouille sausage and Tasso ham smothered with a spicy Cajun sauce. Sold. The burrito wasn't bad, it just wasn't good. The jambalaya and meats were dried. I wasn't expecting fresh but I wasn't expecting something that previously tasted frozen and devoid of moisture. There wasn't really any spice or heat. When I order something that promises to be Cajun at the very least I expect spice, even if the heat isn't there. We also started with the chips and queso and ""Diablo"" red salsa. Neither were good but we are them anyway. My dining companion had the pulled pork sandwich, served alone on a big plate. It had jalapeño bacon that didn't impress him one bit. He also had the chicken tender basket with steak fries. I stole a few fries and a tender. Even when those were cold they were still the best tasting things we had that night. The service was so so. He was eager to take our order but our drinks were empty for periods of time.

My experience last night is what motivated this review. I like to give people the benefit of the doubt but the service last night had to be the epitome of ""we just don't care.""We walked in the bar side and there were some people who seemed to be having a good time. We walked up to the hostess stand and, even though there were many open tables, she asked us to wait while she prepared one for us. After she had ""cleaned"" the table, she sat us...next to a giant pile of spaghetti and meatballs on the floor from where a toddler had thrown it out of his high chair. When the waiter came, we asked to be reseated and he did so but must have thought that was the end of his night because he was completely inattentive for the rest of the evening. My fiancé claims to have seen him wiping his nose several times which, I guess, grossed him out.The food took forever even though we were almost the only people in the restaurant. When it did come, it was bland and over sauced. He ordered fettuccine alfredo and I had a Cesar salad with chicken. Even the chicken was gross. I feel bad the chicken died to be cooked that way. We had some chianti, which was good, but I couldn't help but notice the presence of fruit flies all around the restaurant. I don't know if this was because of the open bottles of wine sitting about or worse. I can forgive a fly in a restaurant with a patio but fruit flies are a different story.There seemed to be a lot of servers there who were not helping anything. I know servers have closing duties to do before they leave the restaurant and that's fine, but there just seemed to be way too many servers there to only have one person who didn't seem very good at his job getting all the tables.

I loved the fresh bread and the spicy olive oil and I had several first dates there - if I was lucky I had a second date there too. Alas, gone are the glory days of the old Macaroni Grill. I recently dined at this location and had a bad experience.  There were so many things wrong here I don't even know where or how to start so I'll just try to sum it up to get this over with. Amateur service you'd expect from a group of beginners included a server spilling a drink on the way to a different table, stopping to ask if the guest was ok, then proceeding to the original table, serving the food, then cracking fresh pepper (this was happening as a full glass of tea made its way to the floor and pooled while not a single server in the place made an effort to clean it or even apologize). Among the comedy of errors was a dirty table that remained uncleared for at least 30 minutes next to us, 4 different dirty wine glasses that were cycled through one table, one of our orders being wrong, no water refills during the entire time we there, and extremely slow service in general.The food used to be so good but it's become a standard corporate menu that is no better than the olive Garden and I hate to say it but I've had better pastas from the freezer section at Target. Stale bread and cheap olive oil seem to be the par here as we ordered my all time favorite the lobster ravioli which was a mess.  Not a single vegetable in this watery sauce that the waiter explained ""was the way they make it"".  Sad...Add insult to injury we were given the check without being asked if we wanted desert! Now, normally that wouldn't have mattered but we had a birthday in the group.  As we sat and stared at each other in dismay we thought it was best that we never got a chance to order desert or even look at the dessert menu. Maybe would could salvage the night and get a subpar dessert at the local grocery store.  True, we were that desperate.It's disappointing to see this place in such a low state because the Macaroni Grill was once stellar. As another reviewer stated we to felt cheated on the way out. Totally not worth the money we paid here. It's not the same Macaroni Grill it once was.The Macaroni Grill will be a business story about what not to do when you grow to an international company store.  Sigh...  Not happy that we paid over 80 bucks for a meal that I could have purchased at the grocery store for about 20 dollars....The only recommendation I can make here is to go across the mall to ClaimJumper or Chuys around the corner.",Romano’s Macaroni Grill,6155147700.0,47.0,2013-03-20,"Mt Juliet, TN",/biz/romanos-macaroni-grill-nashville-3,2.0,40,"Washington, DC",Johnny G.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.200055,-86.5186054,552.499286637459,False,2858.0,2.675,,2.675

They have some of the best crab rangoons- not sugared up like too many crab appetizers, nor do they skimp on the filling. You get eight generous rangoons coupled with a great sweet and sour sauce that is perfect for dipping.I always order takeout from here. I discovered this place because next door Prince's was way too busy with a line out the door, and I was looking for immediate gratification without waiting in the then-cold outdoors. China Village definitely fit the bill. Plus, combination platters are super cheap and come with a great deal of food, perfect for leftover lunches. The spice factor is perfect for the spicier dishes such as orange chicken or General Tso's.Again, due to the ambience, I advocate takeout or delivery.

"123 Ewing DrNashville, TN 37207",4.0,"The bar for Chinese is set low in Nashville, and China Village falls below it. Housed in a dingy strip mall next to Princes Hot Chicken, China Village has none of its neighbor's appeal. The folks here are working hard, keeping the place clean, while turning out fried American Chinese food that is a step below Manchu wok. I hope this family sees the light, and opens up in better location, charges more, and uses higher quality food. In East Nashville, the owner's hard working attitude could finally fill the East Nashville Chinese food desert. The fried rice is dry and precooked, only to be reheated with your favorite meat. The Kung Pao Chicken had a brown sauce and was filled with low quality vegetables like celery to save cost. If you want to stuff your face with cheap Chinese-American food this place could fit the bill, but if you want real Chinese food, don't even think about it.

"123 Ewing DrNashville, TN 37207",4.0,"Husband wanted Chinese food on Sunday and this was the closest place to us that was open. We ordered food to go and just assumed that like most Chinese places, the food would be ready to go in about 10 mins. We left immediately as we live 10 mins away.  Husband went inside and waited for probably 15 minutes. He said they only had one cook and were obviously pretty busy. No big deal, the food should be nice and hot. However, he said the interior was freezing and smelled like a bathroom. That immediately turned me off from this place and I didn't even go inside. We got our food and drove home. We both ordered General tso tofu, mine with steamed rice, his with fried rice, we shared a small order of plain lo mein, and crab rangoon. The tofu was good and hot. My rice was fine. I thought his tasted old and kind of like smoke? The lo mein was tasty. The crab rangoon were cold so we heated them in the oven. Weird that they would be cold. It's as if they cooked them then let them sit while they cooked 10 other people's food, then made our entrees. Anyway this wasn't my favorite place, and it was definitely sketchy as all get out, but we will probably order again down the road I'm sure.",China Village,6152628009.0,237.0,2015-02-23,"Nashville, TN",/biz/china-village-nashville,3.0,13,"Washington, DC",Ashley T.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.1622296,-86.774353,566.7091028370305,False,1196.0,3.8461538461538463,4.0,3.8333333333333335

As for the food everything I've had has been very flavourful. The kitchen is in full view so you can see what's being cooked if you haven't already called in your order. The staff are very friendly.
