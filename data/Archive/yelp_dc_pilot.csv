4.0,5.0,"Every time I visit my sisters in DC we ALWAYS come here for brunch. It's very hard to get reservations here in general, but I like to use the app ""OpenTable"" to make the reservations. It's so much easier to see what days/times they have available around your original search. Founding Farmers is located in Foggy Bottom, very close to George Washington's campus, making it very accessible to get there (walking distance from the metro). I highly recommend getting there early/on time because this place gets PACKED, especially for breakfast/brunch, and they will take your name off the list if you are more than 10-15 min late (I overheard one girl check-in for her reservation but since she was late they already filled her spot). Their waiting area is too small for how many people come in on the weekends, it gets very crowded near the entrance. They have an up-stairs and downstairs to be seated at; I've sat on both floors and personally like the top floor better because it's less crowded and noisy due to it being away from the entrance. Once you're seated, they have two menus. A menu specifically for breakfast/brunch and one for lunch/dinner options. You really can't go wrong with anything you order here, everything is so good (hence why they have 4 stars and over 6,500 reviews). My sisters have ordered the same thing every single time since they first came here a few years back because they love it that much. One orders the classic eggs benedict and the other orders the fresh strawberries and cream waffles. I have to admit their signature chicken pot pie really lives up to it's hype. I'm not one to have had many chicken pot pie's in my life before, but this was a game changer. It was SO CREAMY with big chunks of vegetables and chicken served with a biscuit on top. I have never tasted something so flavorful before, I don't know how they do it. We also ordered their cornbread (because I read yelp reviews highly recommending it) and I was very satisfied; the cornbread had chunks of real corn in it, still hot in the skillet - just the way I like it. I highly recommend anyone that visits the DC area makes reservations here to experience Founding Farmers, even if it's not for breakfast/brunch, it's that good.",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Alexis C.,"Jamaica, NY",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,2.0,"Loved the food, but felt that some ethics were not there. Fortunately, we got a bar spot very quickly - the wait is about 45 minutes even at 1PM on a Friday. As for the venue, it's definitely nice and clean. I loved the floating clouds!As for the food, the fried chicken was 5/5. Just amazing! The platter with the burger, corn, and hot dog was also delicious. I probably wouldn't order it again though since it's just a mix of normal foods. The cornbread was also delicious - a must order with that honey butter.The reason I am not rating higher is because I feel cheated. I asked for a side of pickles and they said I could order pickled vegetables. I said I don't want that - just the pickles to put in the burger. She said okay I can get the kitchen to get some for you. She never asked if I wanted to pay for pickles (no restaurant has ever asked me to buy small sliced pickles). I have no objection to paying but she made it sound like it was no charge. At the end of the meal, I was charged $4 for a small slices of pickles. I think that they need to be upfront and confirm that getting a side of pickles is a fee. I'm open to attending again, but just be cautious!",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Albert K.,"San Francisco, CA",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,5.0,Goat cheese Ravioli with Chicken is OUTSTANDING! The goat cheese is deliciously complex & subtle. The chicken seasoning is wonderful & cooked perfectly.The chicken & waffles was wonderful as well. Crispy full of flavor with huge meat portions & fried perfectly. The waffles were light & fluffy. The maple syrup was incredible! When they store it they put cinnamon sticks in. Complex tasting maple syrup? Who knew!!,6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Derek B.,"Alexandria, VA",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,4.0,"This place was recommended to me by a bunch of friends, so we had to check it out while in DC - it was definitely good but not sure it lives up to the hype. Definitely make reservations online beforehand, otherwise you might have to wait in line for a long time (we were able to make same-day reservations and got seated quickly). The decor inside was okay and it was kind of dark. Some of the tables were a little crowded together too. Service was great and we had a very attentive waiter. The prices here are actually very reasonable (most things are less than $12).For food, I got the breakfast chicken and waffles - I would give it a 4/5. I was a little disappointed when it arrived because I saw it had 3 very small pieces of chicken on the waffles (most pictures on here look like they have at least 4). Chicken was flavorful with good seasoning and not dry - tasted great with the gravy and sunny side up eggs! It's slightly salty on its own but if you combine it with the other stuff, it's just right. Waffle was light and crisp, and not too sweet, which I liked. My friend got the tomato florentine eggs benedict, which she liked but tasted just okay to me. One of the poached eggs was way overdone. We also got coffee for 2, which definitely could serve 3-4 people comfortably. The people next to us got stuffed French toast, which looked amazing - I'll have to try that next time! In short, solid hearty meal at a reasonable price. Would I be willing to wait an hour in line for it though? Probably not.",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Marie H.,"Columbus, OH",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,4.0,I love the decor here!!! Great atmosphere. Start off with the cornbread! The salted butter and honey make it special. The chicken pot pie was delicious and was served pipping hot!

4.0,4.0,"Bottom Line:  A cool place with great food but service is slow.I really like Founding Farmers and I think George Washington would approve too.  The farm to table menu, as cliche as it may be these days, is delicious.  While I don't think you can go wrong here with any menu selections I highly recommend the chicken and waffles.  Also fabulous here are the fresh cocktails, albeit small pours. The desserts looked amazing although I did not get a chance to sink my sweet tooth into one of them. The restaurant is comfy and atheistically pleasing which is good since there is a lot of waiting around that goes on here.  Waiting for a table 15 to 20 minutes despite reservations, waiting for a server to greet us, waiting 20 minutes for drinks to come out, etc. I'm a patient person but wasn't prepared for the slow pace but next time I will be. If you are planning to visit Founding Farmers before another obligation then allow plenty of time to enjoy all that is offered at this delightful Foggy Bottom restaurant.The advertised ""smart casual"" dress code is confusing here but what it basically means is you can wear anything.  On my first visit here we were touring the museums so we wore shorts and shirts with fab accessories like scarves and sheer komono-ish tops to dress up our street attire.  But, if I was going into DC just for dinner I would wear something more along the lines of business casual.Overall a nice experience and I look forward to going back soon.",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Courtney K.,"Annapolis, MD",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,5.0,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday during Labor Day weekend and it was packed beyond belief. I had reservations for 10:15am, we checked in at 10am and we still had to wait 25 minutes to get a table. After I saw that a group that came in after us got seated before us, I asked them why we haven't gotten seated yet and it was because the guy didn't even check us in -_-. Good thing I checked in with them a second time otherwise we would have had to wait forever. But we got seated right afterwards anyways. Food here is so delicious! I literally wanted to try everything on their menu, but we couldn't order too much because we had a lot of tourist things to do and couldn't bring food inside those places. They don't have a big selection of food, but the portions they give you are pretty big and filling. Strawberry stuffed French toast: OMGGGG BEST FRENCH TOAST EVER! I've never had stuffed French toast and now I don't think I will ever go back to regular French toast. The outer layer was crispy, but very oily =| I suggest sharing this dish because eating three pieces of extremely oily and fried French toast doesn't sit well with the stomach. The filling is a vanilla cream and it was delicious. Must find other places in LA that have stuffed French toast. Scrambled eggs with sausage and hashbrowns: my boyfriend ate the sausage and he said it was yummy. Their hashbrowns are pretty good, but not the best I've had, their eggs, HANDS DOWN the best eggs I've had at a restaurant. I think because the eggs weren't dry at all, and it had a good texture to it. Hangover hash: poached egg over hashbrowns and meat. I ate the poached egg and it was cooked to perfection. I would definitely try their eggs benedict if I am ever back in town. I didn't try their meat, but my boyfriend said it was pretty good.",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Christina G.,"Arcadia, CA",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,5.0,"CHICKEN & WAFFLES.Yes it's worth the wait.Yes it's worth the hassle of finding parking.Yes it's worth the hype!!!We traveled to the DC area from San Jose CA where I had never tried Chicken & Waffles in my life. I was skeptical but I said, if I was going to try this dish it might as well be served on the east coast.I was not disappointed at all!!! Best decision was to come here.

4.0,5.0,"I found this place on Yelp and decided that we must come here on our visit to DC. Founding Farmers ended up being our first stop fresh off the plane. We made reservations for 4 at 1015 on Saturday, and we were so glad we did! We heard the hosts tell walk-ins it was a two hour(!) wait. We were seated about 5 minutes after we checked in and we were able to fit our luggage underneath the table and our chairs :) Every. Single. Item. that we ordered was phenomenal. We ordered beignets, chicken and waffles, bourbon batter French toast, strawberries and cream waffles, and bananas foster waffles. Oh, and a side of bacon. Did I mention that everything was amazing? My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The DH and my friend's BF both ordered Bloody Marys that were delicious and satisfying. I, of course, ordered sweet tea and was so excited to see that they served it there. My friend ordered a coffee soda(?) that she seemed to love. FF made it on our ""definitely a must visit every time we go to DC"" list. I would be willing to take a 2 hr flight up there every weekend just to eat there if I could. It's just that good.",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Carlyne M.,"Jacksonville, FL",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,4.0,"Fresh tasting food. I enjoyed the experience here. The seafood deviled eggs were a little pricey, and probably not worth to get again, but I am glad I tried them (they are one of my favorite appetizer kinda foods). The fried green tomatoes were tasty. I am not a tomato fan, but I definitely ate my portion out of them - not too much breading, which is enjoyable. Farmhouse platter (baby cheeseburgers, chili dog, pork ribs, potato salad, corn) - Baby cheeseburgers were delicious! As was the chili dog. The pork ribs were fall off the bone practically. The potato salad I could have done without, and the corn was very well prepared, but it is just corn (in my opinion). RED VELVET CAKE = loveI need to come back for breakfast!",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Amanda W.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,5.0,"If you're in D.C. YOU NEED TO GO HERE.I was in D.C. for a work conference and while stumbling around town, my group got tired and hungry. What are we to do? Yelp stuff, obviously. Making reservations with Founding Farmers is actually really easy since they partner up with Yelp and OpenTable.We set our reservation for 7:30pm. We arrived at 7. They seat us at 7:10pm.When we initially got there, we browsed around the bar just to get a taste of the menu and see what the deal was all about. According to their staff, their menu changes based on the farmers harvest for that year... now that's freaking cool. I don't know why this concept isn't in California yet!Anyways, I ordered this amazing blackberry sour with egg white as my first drink of many drinks that night. What I really enjoyed about that drink was that it tasted like a whiskey sour, but it had hints of eggwhite (obviously) and blackberry (again, obviously), AND A HINT OF CINNAMON (WOAH DUDE).So we were seated promptly and got to our orders almost immediately. The chicken and waffles were just freaking calling my name man, I HAD to do it. We also ordered chicken wings and this amazing cornbread that came with a honey syrup... oh god.The dinner was absolutely phenomenal! The chicken was slapped with this amazing gravy and the waffles were Belgium styled (so that just means they're sweeter or whatever I guess) and good god. JUST STAHP. It was honest to god one of the most satisfying dinner's I've ever had. I initially didn't think it was enough food, but while trying to finish it, it dawned on me that it was a LOT of food and super satisfying.The staff is amazing, the decor is fabulous, the drinks are amazing, AND THE FOOD IS OFF THE HOOK.

4.0,3.0,"I've never seen an establishment with more Yelp reviews!Founding Farmers is VERY popular.  We ate at 6pm and the restaurant was packed with groups of people waiting outside.  Definitely get a reservation before coming.  They're very organized and if you booked a table, they will most certainly honor it despite how many walk-ins might be waiting.The menu is very American/Southern. There were lots of tempting choices (i.e., chicken and waffles... got a weakness for it) and few ""healthy"" choices.  Everything looks pretty hearty and heavy.We started with an order of fried green tomatoes ($8) because I've never had it before. The breading was a little too thick and hard for my taste but I don't know if it's meant to be that way.  The tomato slice are indeed green and tangy! The order came with a green sauce and a goat cheese sauce.We ordered a 14 oz. prime rib (medium) with green beans with candied lemon and the potato salad with pickled vegetables. For $28, it was quite the deal because the portions were massive. The prime rib was OK in flavor. It came with a side of gravy and horseradish sauce. The green beans and potato salad weren't that good. They had pickled cauliflower in the potato salad which gave the whole side a kind of stinkiness.We also had the seafood bucatini which my stomach was intimidated by because it was so big. The seafood included lots of mussels, half a lobster tail, a few shrimp and a piece of fried cod (think fish and chips). It was all very fresh. The sauce had diced tomatoes and a buttery-rich finish. The pasta was good but almost too much. It was al dente but it kind of clung to the bottom of the cast-iron platter. All-in-all, a great deal at $29 for this massive serving of fresh seafood. It also had two large pieces of grilled bread -- who can eat all that food?Note to self -- order the fish and chips next time.  The fried cod in my seafood bucatini was AMAZING.",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Susan K.,"Los Angeles, CA",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,4.0,"This was a last minute choice for me and a date.  He mentioned that it might be busy; we went during lunch.  So, I was able to make a reservation online and arrived in 10 minutes.  It was a good thing that we did because the place was packed.  However, we were immediately seated.  Our server was friendly and offered a number of tasty options.  The food and presentation were very good.  I had the glazed salmon, and my date had the crab cakes.  We were very pleased.All in all, a good place.  The presentation is fantastic....maybe even worthy of a picture.  The portions were adequate, and the service was good.  We will definitely be back!",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Arielle S.,"Fredericksburg, VA",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,5.0,"Just run there right now. It's that good! We had 1:15 reservations on a Monday which I didn't think we would need at all because it was a Monday...but helloooo busy! The place was completely jumping. We were seated just before 1:30 and there was STILL a wait behind us. I will say that I had big expectations for this place and they didn't steer me wrong!We started with the cornbread and honey. Way too big for 2 people and I wish they had 1/2 portions. It had actual corn inside which was crazy to me and I will never make my corn bread without it again.I chose the vegetable sandwich for lunch- which might sound boring. Best sandwich I have ever had. If you love veggies and goat cheese, definitely get this. I had an arnold palmer too because they make all their drinks/sodas/etc in house and I love things like this.Hubby had the chicken pot pie which everyone apparently complains about it because it doesn't have crust. I could have eaten the entire thing! it was like chowder with a delicious biscuit in the middle to soak up all the goodness.If we're back in DC, I'll come here- for lunch, dinner, brunch or whatever they are serving that day!",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Amelia S.,"Providence, RI",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,2.0,"Ton of Yelp reviews & highly rated but why the 2 stars?  For starters, my OpenTable reservation didn't make it thru to their reception desk so check your emails to confirm you actually have a reservation.The restaurant itself is really nice, does give me of a ""farm fresh to table"" feel, food is decent but our service was less than impressive.  Mr. Richard approached us, asked if we wanted some drinks, recommended a terrible cocktail that both my friend and I did not enjoy (The El Presidente or something).  While we were ordering, I asked if I could add scallops to my ravioli, waiter advised this was acceptable.  Per Yelp, the corn bread & fried tomatoes are all the rave so we ordered those as apps.  Richard approaches us again only to tell me the kitchen won't add scallops or anything to my dish, the alternative would be to add a small side of risotto with 3 scallops for $14.  I just said to go with the risotto instead of the ravioli.  Not 2 minutes later did our entrees come out & both the risotto and ravioli were placed in front of me.  I sent it back.  At this point, everything had already come out except our tomatoes!  We were basically done with our meal then asked him where it was- whoops he must've forgot.  The tomatoes came anyway, my fork and knife set were taken away, some other staff member gave me a new set only for it to be taken away by Richard.  I was handed a fork instead & I would like to note the knife would have been VERY helpful.Recommend:- Corn Bread. So light, fluffy and drool worthy with a side of butter & honey.  (We boxed this up & wasn't given the butter & honey)- Spinach Bleu Cheese Bacon Salad.  Very fresh, comes with caramelized onions and apples.  Recommended to share!- Butternut Squash Ravioli. This looked hand made, it was a good balance between sweet from the squash and savory from the garlic & herbs.  Just don't expect to order any protein or seafood on the side.NOT RECOMMENDED-Cucumber Snap Pea Side- there's nothing special about it, no spark, just basic cucumber and snap peas.El Presidente- If you're into bitter drinks, this would be for you but not me.His service was just very off-putting & the drink was bad.  Food is decent though!",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Connie C.,"Canoga Park, CA",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,5.0,"The best cornbread bread I have ever had in my life with tender pieces of corn embedded inside the bread. It is served a skillet with honey butter.  Grilled cauliflower steak seasoned perfectly with a light pesto topping was delicious.. Broccolini was way too salty and did not finish it. The boneless ribeye was tender. For $1.50 more you can have a side of mac and cheese to substitute for one of listed sides. The Mac and cheese was delicious.Also had a Founding salad with fresh grapes and freshly cut avocado and soft homemade croutons.

4.0,4.0,"Whenever I'm in the mood for some fresh, savory American comfort food or handcrafted cocktails, I think of Founding Farmers. Plus those decadent desserts are unmatched and meatless options keep me coming back. This flagship location has been popular among foodies and casual diners for years and for good reason! I've dined here numerous times with minimal disappointment- aside from the wait if I forget to make a reservation. Most times, I sit at the bar to be entertained by the mixologists who respond to requests like ""Make me something fun"" with grace.

4.0,5.0,Oh my gosh this is the best restaurant I went to in DC! I'm from Atlanta and this place really has true soul food that will make you the happiest person alive anytime of the day. I got the chicken and waffles and my sister got the chicken pot pie and we both were so stuffed and even took home leftovers. It's as perfect as it gets!

4.0,5.0,"Out of all the restaurants I tried in DC, this was my absolute favorite. From the moment I walked in, to the moment I left I had a great experience. While we were waiting for our table, I was able to check out their lobby. They have a bunch of books available to read while waiting that feature farm-to-table freshness or about food in general. It resonates with their true food theme. It seems like the restaurant is busy at all times. I love how the bar is square and in the middle of the restaurant rather than at a side. After sitting down, I was already overwhelmed with all the amazing choices! I texted Justin for recommendations, but I didn't follow any of his :P. I ended up choosing a prosciutto bread and my cousin got a corn bread skillet. The corn bread was so soft! It came with a salty-butter which made it even better. The prosciutto bread was also awesome! It had figs and cheese on it too so it was a great start to the meal. I tried their ""Constitution"" drink too with blueberry and lemon. Such a great mix! They really know their cocktails at Founding Farmers.I was already full before getting my entrée: Fried Chicken Salad. The chicken tenders were flavorful, soft, and fresh. I actually didn't really like the salad part of it, just the chicken. But I could see myself liking some of their burgers and sandwiches. My cousin got the shrimp louis cobb salad and it looked like it was great. She agreed that she would not get a salad again, but she has been to Founding Farmers before. For dessert, we tried their warm beignets! I loved the raspberry sauce it came with. It also comes with chocolate and caramel. But all I needed was to douse my beignet in lots of raspberry.

4.0,4.0,"Their skillet cornbread is probably the best cornbread I've had.  It's moist and sweet, with lots of kernels throughout.  It goes really well with the honey and butter.  Fried green tomatoes are also delicious.  Super crispy, but not oily.  Kettle popcorn is also good especially since it's served pipping hot.  The smell itself is very intoxicating. Chicken pot pie is good but the biscuit that comes with it is amazing.  It was big and dense and it complements the dish really well.  Shrimp and grits is also tasty, but a bit watery.  Food is a bit on the heavy side, but well worth the indulgence.  Portions are also quite generous.

4.0,5.0,"I love founding farmers. I ate here in the morning with my girlfriend for breakfast (hangover mash--which comes with corned beef hash and eggs topped with chili), and we enjoyed it so much we booked a reservation for dinner (which was also amazing--I had the pot roast). This restaurant has an ethos of local, organically sourced ingredients for everything. The waiters and servers we had were all excellent, top notch. The atmosphere is nice. The cocktails are great. The food though is what really sets this restaurant apart--imagine homestyle, soul food that your mama makes. We had such a great time at that restaurant, and were so sad when we went back to NYC.Overall, this is hands down one of the very best restaurants I've ever been to. It almost resets the bar for a 5 star restaurant.Pro-tip: There is almost always an hour long wait for this place, so 1) you know it's great, but 2) show up early or make a res and walk around.",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Ben T.,"Manhattan, NY",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington

We normally sit at the bar because it is always very very crowded and we are normally very very hungry (and hung over). The red velvet pancakes are my favorite.

4.0,4.0,"My husband and I stumbled on this place in Foggybottom when we realized we were far from our original plan (Penn Quarter) for burgers. The place looked fun and fancy, and everytime we passed by it, it was packed. It had to be good, amirite? :) Turns out it was. Indeed it was packed, about an hour wait to sit down, but you can be served right away at the bar if there were chairs available. Luckily we found a couple of seats and were served right away. This establishment focuses on locally grown and fresh ingredients, so that being said, there are NO fountain drinks! They have fresh squeezed lemonade, iced tea or orange juice. I asked for a diet coke and was given a glass of ice (LOTS of it too! Just the way I like it!) and a can. I ordered the bleu cheese burger with bacon and fries, and hubs got the burger with goat cheese with chips. I was VERY satisfied with my food! Would have loved more fries, as I was starving and we had already walked 2 miles, but that's ok. The burger was very tasty and the balsamic onions and bleu cheese was a very tasty compliment to the meat. Hubs was satisfied with his burger as well. I should've got the chips, because they seemed to have served more.

4.0,3.0,"We came here with high expectations Bc we love the MOCO founding farmers. This location had lots more reviews so we were expecting it to be different, however I was a little disappointed.Moco's food is far better. We ordered our usual and their signature chicken and waffles.  Chicken and waffles were great and cooked and flavored to perfection, but the Mac and cheese was a bit undercooked and dry. MOCO always serves their Mac and cheese warm and fresh- noodles are always the perfect amount of chewy.  We got a side of cucumber/ snap peas.  It was served lukewarm and the cucumber was rather soggy.  I was hoping for a cool salad taste/texture.Our second dish was the scallops. The scallops were served on a bed of risotto. The flavor of the risotto was great, but was a bit undercooked- much like the Mac and cheese noodles.  There were 4 pieces of scallops.  Crispy and brown on the outside and chewy on the inside! Loved it but I did feel so gritty rocks with every bit of my scallops. Maybe they didn't clean it enough.

4.0,4.0,"This is an expensive restaurant with decent food and good drinks.I am from the deep south, so I bring with me preconceived notions about southern food. This is a fusion restaurant, so it is by definition not within the southern culinary doctrine. Nevertheless, there changes are interesting and generally good. Still, it is not worth an exceptionally long wait.The drinks (bar) are actually really creative and worth trying. I have no recommendations because they are all good.

The blueberries were fresh and it was a well balanced cocktail.Appetizer: *CORNBREADDon't waste your time looking at anything else. Moist cornbread with little corn niblets smothered in honey butter how can you resist...I definitely had too much but I don't regret it. Main course:*Pork Ribs! I was feeling bbq and homesick and the thought of tender ribs just latched onto my words and I ordered them with no hesitation.  The ribs were perfect! So meaty and tender and the sauce was perfect.

4.0,5.0,"The wait for this place would have been ridiculous had we not manage to get a shared table almost immediately after walking in without a reservation. We shared the table with a stranger, but the food and service was well worth it. Our waiter, Oscar was very passionate about the food, knew about everything on the menu, and gave the best suggestions to my friends and I, who had never eaten there. He was a super cool guy who also knows what vegan and vegetarian items to recommend.Friends got the chicken and waffles and the vegetable and avocado sandwich which set the standard for how every vegetarian sandwich should be; filled with rich avocado, tomato, and mouthwatering veggies. The Butcher's hot dogs and rolls were amazing with buttery soft rolls and great choices for your 3 rolls. The blue cheese bacon with arugula and sautéed onion was yummy, but the tomato chow chow (like a sweetish tomato relish) was the bomb! I should have listened to our waiter and gone for all 3 dogs with the chow chow. Mint watermelon side (also ordered for me by the waiter) was totally on point. Friend's loved their meals and we left very full and extremely satisfied. Giving 5 stars for the experience and short wait, but for most people visiting around lunchtime it would likely be much longer. Nevertheless, I would totally visit again!",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Cathleen H.,"Fairfax, VA",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington

4.0,5.0,"Heck YEAH! What a breakfast! This place will satisfy the lumberjack and the librarian.From the espresso to the bacon, these guys know how to rock a breakfast brunch. We had first attempted to make reservations, but none were available, so we inquired about the bar seating and were informed that it was a first come, first served bar. The place was supposed to open at 9, but the doors were unlocked at 8:45 to seat the crowd that had already started to form outside. We snuck in at the perfect time to be the first ones at the bar, and we were greeted by one of our favorite waitresses of the trip. She was hilarious! My friend ordered the Founders Breakfast with salad and fruit, and I had the ham and eggs. Oh, my! Delectable! I would definitely make this a planned stop if you are in the DC area.

4.0,5.0,"I had to see for myself - why Founding Farmers is such a big deal... Well I'm visiting from Fort. Lauderdale, Florida and made a reservation for this restaurant more than 1 week in advance through Open Table. My boyfriend & myself were seated upstairs with a waiter by the name of Kelvin. We weren't really sure what to order since everything on the menu sounded great, so Kelvin provided his input of the ""signature"" chicken and waffles and the pot roast. We started with the corn bread. The corn bread was defiantly the best corn bread I've ever had. You could taste the freshness from the corn, it tasted as if it was just cut from the cob. I ordered the ""signature"" chicken and waffles and my boyfriend ordered the BBQ ribs. The ""signature"" chicken and waffles were served with macaroni and cheese and your choice of a side, so I ordered the mashed potatoes. It was also served with gravy on the side (per Kelvin's suggestion) and syrup on the side. This meal was absolutely delicious. It may have been the best chicken and waffles that I've ever had. And to be honest - this macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes is the best I've ever had. (I always rate J Alexander's #1 did their macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes but now Founding Farmers is #1). The BBQ ribs were served with two sides. My boyfriend ordered  the green beans and the French fries (that wasn't on the list of sides). The BBQ ribs were filled with so much meat. I couldn't believe how much meat was on the bone. The green beans were really fresh and the French fries didn't taste greasy at all.  Overall: DELICIOUS food, great service, and reasonable prices.

I do not understand they hype, or why people line up in droves to eat here. I have never found it that remarkable.I met some friends there for brunch this weekend and service took forever. I mean we were there close to 3 hours! Food was ok. My friend ordered a burger (no cheese) and it came out with cheese, so she had to sit and wait for a while before she could join us. Getting the check at the end took forever. (Cue Sandlot... ""forrrreeeeevvvvveeerrrrrrrrrrrrr..."")I had the farmer's salad which came in a large size, and a small. I went with large and when it came out, I had to ask to make sure it wasn't the wrong size. That shit was tiny. For an entree size? No way. My friend had the shrimp cobb salad and hers was a decent size. If you're hungry, skip the farmer's salad. I don't have a huge appetite and I cleaned my little bowl and could have eaten another. I don't know. I live in Chicago, land of brunch opportunity. Are there just fewer places in DC? Why do people like this place so much??

4.0,4.0,"Locals recommended this place and we stopped in for lunch. We came a few minutes before they served lunch, which I highly recommend. The place was packed and there isn't much of a sitting area in the front. There are some great healthy/whole foods paperback books on display to pass time. If you can't get there early, make reservations beforehand. I really liked the modern, yet rustic feel of the place. Despite it being so crowded and loud for a week day lunch, the place seemed well organized. They had plenty of staff members tending to customers and our server was able to answer all of our questions about the menu and made great recommendations. The menu consists of amped up Americana cuisine. For appetizers, we orders the Fried Green Tomatoes and the Skillet Corn Bread. The Fried Green Tomatoes was good, but my favorite dish here was the cornbread. I must admit, that corn bread was the BEST I have ever had -- hands down! So moist with bits of corn kernels and that sea salted honey butter slathered on it was just like heaven in my mouth. =) For entrees, we had the Chicken and Waffles and the Yankee Pot Roast. The chicken was absolutely delicious. It was well-seasoned, not greasy, but still very tender. The waffles were good, but nothing spectacular. The pot roast was very tender and came out with a heaping portion of mashed potatoes. However, it was a tad bit salty, even for my taste.  Overall, our experience here was great! We really loved the restaurant and food, but most importantly, we liked how the place was so organized, despite the chaotic lunch crowd. Would definitely recommend.",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Diana N.,"Houston, TX",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington

Highlights were definitely the corn bread, the bread with brie, chutney and apple and the chicken and waffles with a side of mint watermelon! My only regret is that I don't remember the name of our server because she was great and super helpful as we were agonizing over all the delicious choices.

At the time I was thinking 'chicken and waffles' but I ended up with a last minute audible.Negative: I made a reservation for 4.

Especially since the front area of the restaurant is extremely poorly laid out. Hard to explain without seeing it.Food was again delicious. We got some cornbread as an appetizer that was really good. Some places around this area make it and it ends up dry in the center. Not this one it was so good.Dinner I got ham, Apple, and pea with macaroni and cheese. It's as amazing as it sounds. Never thought of mixing these foods but wow does it come out tasting good! I also got a cup of their coffee.

4.0,1.0,"I had a reservation. When I checked in, I was told the wait time would be ten minutes. Okay, no big deal, it was a busy Saturday, I don't mind waiting a little bit...until that wait turned into an hour.  I checked in with the host twice, both times being told the wait would be another ten to fifteen minutes. On my third visit to the host stand, they said they had called my name previously and I was blamed for missing it. I was standing within ten feet of the host stand, no one called my name. I was then assured it would be another ten to fifteen minutes.  In conclusion, I was finally seated over an hour after my reservation time at a tiny table wedged between two other couples. My fiance and I left before our server even came over, suddenly we just weren't hungry.  I'm sure the food is amazing, just like all these other reviews state.  My complaint is regarding the host service.  If it was going to be an hour wait, they should have told us when we initially checked in. And if it was going to be an hour wait from our reservation time, what's the point of having a reservation system?  The ridiculously long wait combined with the condescending attitude of the host made for a very disappointing experience.   I know these are ridiculous first world problems but this is Yelp, so I'm laying it out there.  I was really excited about this brunch and it was such a bummer.  I love food and I like to write about great places that serve great food, but I regarding Founding Farmers, I guess I'll never know...",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Laurel A.,"Washington, DC",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington

Service too was less than stellar for our latest visit :(Now for the good stuff :) The rest of the experience was, as expected, very good! I tried the Jerk Soda, which was Raspberry. I am generally not a fan of Raspberry but this was really good; the tartness sure did wake me up! For the main course I ordered 3 Hot Dogs - with Tomato Chow Chow, Chili, and Crab cake. The crab cake was not technically a hot dog but was very flavorful. The 2 hot dogs were good too - I preferred the tomato chow over the chili by a hair.The dish size is like other FF dishes - enough food to put you in a food coma, or yummy leftovers for an evening snack in my case :)Founding Farmers does remain at the top of our most favored restaurants in DC!",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Vishal S.,"Potomac, MD",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington

The building itself has modern farmhouse décor. From the bar has an amazing list of unique, custom drinks with a large variety of spirits - locally made and beyond. The food is phenomenal. Try the beignets, they are better than the ones I had in NOLA. I enjoyed the sausage, egg and spinach scramble for my main dish- nothing complicated, just superb.  We were so impressed with brunch that we returned for dessert later that day. We each got something different- the triple chocolate layered cake, milk & cookies, and carrot cake. All of the portions are more than enough.

4.0,4.0,"Founding Farmers is a great value for the type and quality of food they serve. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that this restaurant could get away with charging more for their food since it's fairly upscale. This upscale feeling is further enhanced by the solid-wood decor.In addition to upscale food, you get a lot of it. Both my friend and I were impressed by the amount of food we got, and there were people around us that had leftovers to take home. Service is another plus at this restaurant. The waiters were very fast to take our orders, and they were very knowledgeable about the menu in terms of giving recommendations. Despite these glowing qualities, I did feel that my food was severely over-salted. The pork chop I had was so salty that I could only eat it in conjunction with my potatoes and pasta.

The Chicken & Waffles comes with two huge (I mean, HUGE) bone-in pieces of chicken, 1/2 a waffle, mac & cheese, some country style gravy, and a side of your choice (I went with the Mint Watermelon). The chicken was perrrrrrrfect. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and I love that the chicken was bone-in. The mac & cheese was creamy and delicious as well. Pretty much, everythiing about my dish was solid. I had a bite or two of my boyfriend's Pot Roast, and I thought it was absolutely delicious - super flavorful, and the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender.

Atmosphere was kind of loud, but that's because it was lunch hour and very busy. We were upstairs where they said it was ""quieter"" -- so that was nice. They sat my husband and I at a table for 6. With three other couples. However, I appreciate that they don't sit anyone directly next to you so you feel like you get some privacy and space. Food was really good! I went out on a limb and ordered the chicken and waffles which were SO good. Their waffle syrup really is to die for! I also got a side of mac and cheese (which was delicious as well) and their mint watermelon -- that was okay, watermelon seemed a little over ripe and the mint was a little strong for me! Honestly, next time I would go with the green beans! My husband order the rotisserie chicken which he really enjoyed. The only thing he wish he had was some type of sauce to dip the chicken in (we are sauce people, we tend to like everything sauced up!) But I tried it his meal and thought it was really good as well.Service was not the best unfortunately. Our server was nice, he was just never around.

4.0,4.0,"Finally I crossed Founding Farmers off my places to try! I am also very glad I came to this location and not the Tysons Corner location. From the Yelp reviews it doesn't seem like they are doing as well as the D.C. one. Alexis K and I decided to grab dinner here after walking around Georgetown on a Saturday around 6. At that time, the wait for 2 was 45 mins to an hour. They don't offer beepers so you are advised to check with the hostess once a certain time has elapsed. It took slightly less than an hour to get a seat, which is certainly not bad considering it was a Saturday and the amount of people in the restaurant (it was filled to the max). Their menu offers a variety of choices, and after some contemplation I went with the Yankee Pot Roast and my gf got the Chicken & Waffles. Usually pot roast at restaurants is pretty salty so I was a bit concerned to be honest. However, after one delicious bite my concern vanquished into thin air. The serving size for the pot roast was more then plenty. I am usually a pretty big eater but I barely finished my dish. The pot roast come with 2 huge slabs of meat, potatoes, carrots, celery, and onion. The chicken & waffle was also very good, the chicken was very moist. My gf has had their chicken at Tysons location and she says that it significantly better at this location. After our wonderful experience here at Founding Farmers I look forward to coming back to try out the many other items that captivated me. Now as far as their service goes, it was very good at the beginning but after the food came out we did not see our waitress. The empty plates and bowls sat on our table for probably 10 minutes before a manager came and removed it. Besides the lack of a waitress during our meal I would highly recommend this restaurant. Technically the Tysons location is way closer to my house but I still intend on frequenting the original location. The original one is always better.

I made reservations on OpenTable knowing full well how crowded this place gets during the high noon hour. For a minute, I was panicked when the host couldn't find my reservation but luckily it was all a technical error and we were seated a few minutes later upstairs. The restaurant was half-full at 11:30am and when we left, it had pretty much reached full capacity. So definitely make reservations unless you like waiting!After perusing the menu, I opted for the mushroom meunière and risotto ($17) and my mom ordered the shrimp and sundried tomato bucatini ($19). Both dishes lean on the heavier side. My risotto was good but it was oilier than I expected. There were several large mushrooms, which were cooked just fine. But I was a little surprised to see how drenched the whole dish was in oil. I had a few bites of the shrimp and sundried tomato bucatini, and it was pretty good. Shrimp was well-cooked and the bucatini was flavorful. Mom and I split the chocolate mousse bowl for two ($10). It literally comes in a mixing bowl with chocolate mousse topped with whipped cream, hazelnut crunch, and drizzled in caramel sauce. Heavy but good if you need a sweet tooth fix.

Let me tell you, it definitely lived up to the hype! First, I will say, definitely make a reservation! This place was packed and there isn't too much room to be standing and waiting for your table. We had a couple minutes until our table was ready (they accommodated 12 of us!) so I ventured to the bar. I ordered The Clementine and was sold! It was the perfect balance of spicy sweet which I can not get enough of these days. We had a variety of drinks throughout the group and one I tried with cucumber and melon was also very good! I ended up having two drinks, one before dinner and one during and was set!For food, our table ordered a bunch of apps. We had the kettle corn (comes fresh and hot in a huge pot!), the spiced nuts, the cheese flat breads, fried green tomatoes and more. I think the consensus of the group was the fried green tomatoes stole the show! But I don't think you could go wrong. For my meal I decided to get the prime rib. It was delicious. It has a salted edge which I wasn't a fan of but the middle was perfect and I got a lot of meat and not too much fat. I had the lemon green beans for dinner (delish) and the zucchini and raisin pasta (it was okay. I am not a huge fan of mint and I think there was too much). Although my meal was pretty good I tried my friend's pot roast and oh my gosh! Food envy!! It was spectacular! I heard the same rave reviews about the chicken a waffles. All in all, you can't go wrong here. I would recommend sticking to their signatures but if you venture off, I don't think there is a bad thing on the menu!",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Briana B.,"Raleigh, NC",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington

4.0,5.0,"SEXY TIME IN MY MOUTH FROM APPETIZER, ENTREE TO DESSERT!My friend and I went here for a late-ish lunch and thought we would be waiting at least 40 minutes for a table but it turned out that there was an available table in 5 minutes. We got so lucky. I was excited to eat at this place as my friend talked about Founding Farmers' food.FOOD:- Bacon Loli: HOLY CRAP! I just can't explain why this was so good of an appetizer... you have to try it. HAHA!- Chicken and Waffles with a side of Mint Watermelon: THIS IS THE BEST CHICKEN AND WAFFLES I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. West Coast Chicken and Waffles got nothing on this! Seriously, the fried chicken was not greasy/oily and it was oh so juicy. Thinking about this dish makes me wish that I'm still in DC eating this for dinner, lol. The dish also came with a very creamy mac n cheese and a side of Mint watermelon with Sea Salt. I don't think I could ever eat Chicken and Waffles from another place than Founding Farmers.DESSERT:- Deep Chocolate House-Churned Ice Cream: #sexytimeinmymouth. Oh my gawwwwd! It was more of a gelato quality than ice cream. It was very creamy, the Chocolate is very decadent, it didn't taste like I'm going to have diabetes type of dessert. It was a very well-done dessert. Very simple yet extraordinary dessert. I really enjoyed every single moment that I was eating it.SERVICE:Shout out to our server, John for taking care of us from beginning to when we were eating until the end! He was such a warm, friendly person to talk to! He also looked like Daniel Bryan, the WWE Intercontinental Champion pro-wrestler! OVERALL:Make sure to make reservations because this place is mad busy. We got lucky to walk-in for a table. I will be back! I will be devouring that Chicken and Waffles again and again!

4.0,3.0,"Came for breakfast earlier this week. Breakfast was good but I don't recommend the chicken and waffles (they weren't bad they just aren't FF's best, they may need to look into buttermilk syrup). Wife had the pastrami and we shared the French toast which both were amazing. Tonight we are trying the dinner and will see what happens. We started the night off with corn bread and bacon pops. Both were very good. I tried the chicken pot pie. The pot pie was very good my only complaint is it should have been called a carrot and celery pot pie. (had to hunt for the chicken and only found a quarter of what I was expecting.) My wife enjoyed all of her meals I guess I just had bad luck or my taste buds were off on both visits.

4.0,3.0,"The food is good, steady and consistent. With that said, I have found their menu to be uninspired compared to other southern inspired restaurants in DC. Also, the creativity of the dishes leaves something to be desired.The good: cedar plank salmon. Biscuits with honey. Their specialty sodas and heavy poured cocktails.The bad:  I think they need to be more experimental with their dishes.

4.0,4.0,"Fresh farm-to-table food, a full bar, a clever name, a location right in the heart of Foggy Bottom, and tons and tons of 20-somethings try to score some phone numbers from each other.  Sounds like a recipe for yuppie heaven (or hell, depending on who you are).This place was absolutely PACKED when I walked in around 8:30pm on a Tuesday, which says something about its popularity.  Definitely make a reservation if you're interested in eating here - it'll save you a lot of time waiting outside in the elements.  In the front of the restaurant, there are a bunch of books that you can read while you're waiting about the value of farm-to-table freshness, and all of the ""true food"" stuff that you could ever want to fill your head with.I got their signature chicken pot pie, which is a bit of a misnomer.  It was really just pot pie filling with a biscuit in the middle, but still good nonetheless.  The chicken breast pieces were super tender and cooked really well, and all of the vegetables just tasted super fresh.The vibe and decor of the place are fantastic - this is definitely one of the places in DC where you could meet up with some friends after work.  It's a bit on the pricey side, but definitely check this place out if you're visiting DC (and after you're done eating, walk three blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue to check out the White House).",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Josh C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,3.0,"I like this place. I wasn't amazed by it, but it was good. A few friends and I met at FF midweek for dinner and the place was absolutely teeming with people. It was pretty unbelievable that it was that packed on a Wednesday night. Thankfully, we had reservations and after waiting about 15 minutes, we were taken upstairs to our table. Mike, our server, greeted us warmly and then Sam (perhaps the manager on duty?) came to our table and apologized for our wait. She even mentioned that she hoped the wait didn't ruin our experience. I thought that was a very nice gesture!I got the hibiscus soda and chicken and waffles, along with the cornbread for the table to start. Having grown up in the South, the cornbread was mediocre but I did like that it had real pieces of corn in it. However, it lacked flavor. The chicken and waffles was also underwhelming. While the portion size was good, the seasoning was very mild on the chicken and the waffle was rather hard. It essentially crumbled into pieces when I cut it. To his credit, Mike asked if we wanted our waffles cooked any special way and after tasting their ""default"" preparation, I would recommend asking for a soft waffle.After dinner, we considered dessert. Since one of my friends loves the beignets there, we went with an order of those and the chocolate ice cream. This was the highlight of the meal. The ice cream was so smooth and creamy it basically just melted in my mouth. That, along with the warm beignets - which take about 25 minutes to make (so order them early if you want them!) - was the perfect ending to the meal.

4.0,5.0,"This place really is as good as the reviews suggest. We went on a Sunday for brunch. Made a reservation for 1pm, and only had to wait maybe 10 minutes past our res time to get seated. The service was pretty good -- not exceptional, but no complaints either. The place is always packed and the servers are busy, but our server was attentive and friendly. For food, we started with the cornbread. AMAZING. Get the cornbread. For our entrees, I had the roasted veggie scrambler and the BF had the chicken and waffles. He inhaled his food before I had a chance to try it, but it looked delicious. My scrambler was fantastic. Full of veggies and topped with cheese, served with hash browns. The portions are big, but the food is all very fresh and well prepared, so I didn't feel overwhelmingly full when we left. Overall I'd definitely recommend this place. It's that good!

My top 3 on the menu:Fraise Fling (pretty pink drink with lychee (similar to strawberries), vodka, and proseccoLa Paloma (if you like tequila, great cocktail that's not too sweet)Darm n Stormy (classic, they do it well)Atmosphere: It's a lively place that is always busy. It's casual and approachable yet classy. Great for dinner with friends, a business meeting, or a date. Upstairs is a little bit quieter than downstairs if you want to be able to talk extensively. Service: All of the servers are knowledgeable and can tell you about the restaurant, their concept, the bar program, and the menu. My servers have always been attentive but not overbearing. Price: You can make it as expensive or inexpensive as you want. You can easily get an $11 entree if you're trying to keep costs lower, or you can add on an appetizer, nice cocktail, dessert if you choose. This is a great go-to for almost any occasion.

Everyone who goes to this restaurant as young though, not that oldies aren't welcome, it just has the ""young hipster"" feel to it.Food was fresh, hearty, and gorgeously prepared. They give you the perfect amount and I highly recommend saving room for dessert. Their cakes, warm cookies, and ice cream are a couple of options. And the slices of cake are HUGE! The place itself is pretty huge. It's two floors and has nice COMFTY round booths in the middle of the rooms or you can get a looooong wooden table by the all around windows with a view of the city.

4.0,4.0,"While visiting DC we came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. We did not make reservations and even though it was full to the point where there was no where to stand we didn't wait long for a table. We waited less than 15 minutes before they called us for a table, it was four of us in the group. The atmosphere of the place is great, I liked the the modern/southern feel everything has. My wife and I ordered the stuffed french toast with strawberries and the eggs benedict. The french toast was good they were very filling and too sweat for my taste. The eggs benedict were delicious! They were just perfect.The side salad that came with it was good too, I wish I can remember the dressing they used.

4.0,5.0,"I've eaten at Founding Farmers twice. Both visits have been for breakfast, once during the week and once on a weekend. The place can get busy, but they readily accept reservations both online and by phone. You'll likely get a better table (i.e. one that isn't ""shared"") if you make reservations. Regardless of how busy they've been though, our service experiences have been excellent though. The kitchen staff seems to keep up with the pace as well.As for the food, the stuffed French toast (bananas foster and strawberries and cream) was so amazing during our first visit that we ordered the same two items again on our second visit! Now, when I say the French toast is amazing, I am referring to a center of creamy, gooey goodness with a slightly crispy outside that has the power to actually make you enjoy your morning with a smile on your face!! Then, as if that wasn't enough, there's a large dollop of real whipped cream awaiting you on top of all that wonderful French toast. It's like the centerpiece to the whole wonderful experience. Personally, I opted to enjoy my incredible breakfast with a homemade, frothy chocolate milk, but that's just my personal choice. My wife instead enjoys their fresh, cold-pressed juices. Either way, we've both delighted in our Founding Farmer's breakfast experience thus far.A menu note....you'll find a range of healthy to not so healthy offerings. There's something for everyone! It's a nice eclectic place to visit when you don't know someone's individual food preferences, as both meat and non-meat lovers could be happy here.",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Erin M.,"Washington, DC",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,5.0,"oh you know.... just throwing in another 5 stars im here from boston with coworkers and they had assigned the no pressure task of finding an awesome place for dinner.... this place was highly recommended by a local friend so my coworkers and i walked 30 mins through dc to get here. when i saw the line my heart dropped.  why i didnt stalk this place on yelp is beyond me. well, we got REALLY lucky and ended up snagging seats by the bar so only waited about 10 mins for dinner.... cheers to the Lord for this miracle. so anyways, apparently you cant go wrong here so we tried the brie apple onion jam bread and added bacon (recced by bartender) and i got the chix & waffles w/ watermelon side the bread board thing was a lot more than i thought!! it was very yummerz!!!!! the chix waffs were also spectacular. chix verrrrry moist and the waffles were suuuuuuuuper light but crunchy exterior. ive had my fair share of chix waffs and usually the waffles are very dense which i dont like. these waffles were perfection.  actually just in general, waffs i think are the best waffs ive  ever had. didnt really care for the mac and cheese and mint sea salt watermelon though. watermelon was toooo salty. anyways... next time ill plan ahead and make a reservation.............",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Francis C.,"Boston, MA",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,3.0,"I came with my parents for an early lunch, around 10:45 on a Friday, and were seated pretty quickly, but were told we had to be out by noon to accommodate some reservations. Our server, John, was great, and probably the highlight of the experience, but I must say, I'm quite disappointed with average-ness of the food here. We started off with the fried green tomatoes, and they were quite good, an order of 4 per $8 plate, especially the breading. However, they were on the small side, about 2.5 inches or so in diameter, if you want to get numerical.My dad ordered the two crab cakes, with the mashed red potatoes and pearl pasta ($30), which was quite good, as the crab cakes were packed with chunks of crab and virtually no filler, about the size of pool table ball (but not the weight of one!!). The potatoes were velvety, and the pasta was great as well, especially the unique texture.My mom got the fish of the day, which was a wild-caught red snapper, potato salad and green beans ($28 - market price). The snapper had a nice crunch, and the salad was good, and I'm pleased to say there wasn't any heavy mayo mixed in, just a light a fresh potato salad. The green beans were extremely fresh and crunchy with a really tasty slice of candied lemon on top, that my mom happily devoured.I ordered the chicken pot pie ($15), and this is really what disappointed me. It was in fact, just a bowl of cream of chicken soup topped with a biscuit. I would have been fine with the remix of the traditional pot pie, but soup was cloyingly sweet. My mom tried it, and she remarked of its odd sweetness, and it soon became forgotten on the table.If I visit next time (if there is a next time), I'll try the breakfast and brunch items, and hope for better.",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Gina L.,"California, MD",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,5.0,"This review is for the dinner time menu and service!Came by late-August for a going-away dinner with some friends before leaving the District. It was my first time here, but I've heard GREAT things about Founding Farmers. One particular note I heard again and again was to MAKE A RESERVATION before coming in. Once we got there, I completely understood! It was PACKED with people waiting to get a table! And on a Thursday evening for dinner, no less! I'll go ahead and break down my experience and explain why I absolutely do not regret this being our going-away dinner:Service: With our reservation, we did not have to wait long AT ALL to get a table. There were five of us total in our party, to which we sat in a booth seat on the second floor. Three of us were coming there for the first time. We wanted to go through EVERYTHING on the menu before making a decision. I know I kept stopping every few items to turn and ask my friend for his suggestion on certain dishes. Therefore, I really appreciate how friendly and patient our server was with dealing with us. She came by to check on us regularly, and was always upbeat. I never felt rushed by her. We had even asked for her to take a few pictures of us at the end of our meal, and she was so kind to help us out with that. Ambiance:Dinnertime at Founding Farmers has this cool, funky vibe--which is pretty applicable to life in the District anyway. I had a very ""Got off from work and want to spend time with friends"" feel, without feeling too underdressed or overdressed either (seeing as I didn't have time to change after work). The lights are dimmed, but not to the point where you can't see. Just enough to set a casual enough mood. The upbeat attitude from the servers made it really easy to feel comfortable. Food:I had ordered the Chicken Pot Pie, and it was absolutely amazing. The biscuit on top was delicious! It crumbled apart so easily, with keeping a crunchy exterior. The soupy part of the pot pie was so rich in garlic flavor. My friend kept reaching over to dip his rotisserie chicken in my soup! Another friend had ordered the chicken and waffles and was not disappointed at all! She loved it! Overall, we loved our food. That flavors were delicious. We also ordered a red velvet cake which we all shared and dug into. The cake was moist and dense, letting flavor really show through. It was absolutely amazing. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed our meal at Founding Farmers. It was a wonderful place to do our farewell dinner, and I'm sad that I didn't have the opportunity to try out their Breakfast/Brunch menu. Once I get back to DC, I'm definitely headed back here...with a reservation! The food was delicious, the service was so friendly and welcoming, and it was easy for our table to just talk and be involved with each other. Thanks for the great experience, Founding Farmers!",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Andrea A.,"Irvine, CA",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,3.0,"I came here on a Thursday afternoon around 1:30pm and the place was packed! I was quoted a 45 minute wait time for a table of one, so I headed to the bar in hopes that I'd find a seat, and I'm so glad I did. I squeezed into the last empty seat and waited for 10 minutes before I got some water and a menu.I quickly decided on the steak and enchilada plate with a glass of Russian River Pinot Noir. The wine was an excellent choice and was poured for me very quickly. Food followed in about 10 minutes. The plate had a corn on the cob with some cotija cheese and seasonings, a flank steak with a cilantro chutney and two chicken enchiladas with a dollop of sour cream on top. The corn was delicious but a pain to eat because I refused to grab it with my hands, and wanted to slice off the kernels using a fork and knife. I spent about 3 minutes getting as much of the corn off as possible before starting my meal. The steak was cooked and seasoned well but I wasn't sure that it complemented the chicken enchiladas well. Also, the enchiladas would've been ever better with some extra sauce and spices.After finishing about 3/4 of the plate, I realized I wasn't full yet. Instead of finishing the plate, I decided to order another entree. There wasn't anything wrong with the original entree but I figured I came all the way here from out of town and this dish wasn't really mind blowing like I had hoped. So, with the bartender's recommendation, I ordered the shrimp and grits with a glass of their house brand rye whiskey. The shrimp and grits looked more like a stew, which was unexpected, but the flavors were really delicious! Also I had previously only had the shrimp and grits as a brunch item so was initially surprised not to see poached eggs on top. There were giant pieces of shrimp, chunks of veggies and really good grits that had soaked up the broth. The rye was legit, and my favorite from this trip.I would avoid lunching here if you're in a rush. But, I recommend it if you have a few hours for a leisurely meal. Large enough drinks and food selection for a multi course meal, and lively fun atmosphere.",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Jenny K.,"Bellevue, WA",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington

4.0,3.0,"We stopped in here for a late breakfast on a Saturday in June (would that be a brunch?). Stupidly, we failed to make reservations despite it being a Saturday and it being such a popular restaurant. In our defense, as out-of-towners, we just thought it was a popular diner and who makes reservations at a diner? I should have done my due diligence and researched the place more. So, we had a solid 75 minute wait to be seated. The nice thing about being from out of town is that there's so much to see and do that it's not too hard to occupy yourself while you wait.  We wandered over to James Monroe Park and had a coffee across the street at Greenberry's.I will say that the hosts/hostesses were extremely nice. Despite how busy and popular this place is they all maintained their smiles and cheerful attitudes the entire time. No grumpy overwhelmed and burnt out hosts here. Kudos to them.We ended up sharing a fairly large table with another party. It wasn't too awkward as it was a big enough table we had a decent space between our two small parties. Normally, I would not be able to deal with that as I have an unreasonably large ""personal bubble"" and need my space. However, we had no reservation so beggars cannot be choosers. We were seated on the condition we would be done dining in 90 minutes as they had a reservation at that time that would need our large table.  It was not a problem as I've never been one to linger in a restaurant.  Frankly, people who linger in busy restaurants while others wait endlessly to be seated are rude and inconsiderate. Shut up, eat, and get out. You can yap endlessly somewhere else.My wife and I ordered the Founding Farmers Breakfast.  Basically, two eggs, choice of meat, choice of bread, and a side.  I ordered my eggs poached and they did an excellent job of it. My wife ordered the sausage and it was pretty bland. I opted for the bacon and it too was underwhelming. So, both of our meat choices were flops. We both also chose the Leek Hash Browns.  They had a good flavor but were terribly undercooked.  You have to put the brown in hash browns, people!  Overall, I'd say the food used high quality ingredients, but the flavor just wasn't there/  My daughter ordered the Farmhouse Waffle and enjoyed it.  I'll apologize now for the syrup mess I am sure she created.Our waitress was just okay. She seemed exhausted and a little annoyed and I just didn't get a very welcoming vibe from her at all. Her mouth was saying all of the right stuff but her body language was screaming for us to leave immediately.  The only smile we did get was when she handed us the bill as if her last ditch effort at pleasantness was going to rescue her gratuity.  She should take lessons from the hosts on how to treat people.The restroom situation is not good. They basically have 4 unisex bathrooms. They're all one-at-time bathrooms.  Also, a lot of people are not aware there are bathrooms upstairs. Consequently, you have a restaurant as crowded as this with the capacity for only two people to use the restroom at a time. So, naturally, people are queued up to go potty.I think this place is a little over-hyped and overrated. There are three groups of people that once they find a restaurant that serves their kind of food and does a decent job of it they will then proceed to flood the web with 5-star reviews of the place. Not because the restaurant, comprehensively and holistically, is a 5-star establishment, but because their food sensitivity zealotry blinds them to all else. These three groups are (in no particular order): Vegans/Vegetarians, Gluten Free, and Green.  I tend to summarily dismiss their reviews the moment I realize they fall into one of those groups.This is certainly one of THE places to eat in DC and it shows. Definitely make a reservation. Overall, pretty decent food.  It's not the pinnacle of dining that reviewers think it is, but it's worth a try. It certainly seems to be on a lot of people's ""must try"" lists when they visit DC.",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Chad K.,"Gretna, NE",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,3.0,"After experiencing the wait and the shared table we made a reservation for Saturday morning. We still had to wait but definitely worth making the reservation. The Downtown DC location is BUSY.  I can never get hash browns living in the South always breakfast potatoes so this is always a must.OrderedPancakes, hash browns, crab benedict, waffle, French press coffee. Exceptional pancakes. The say Rias Bluebird was voted the best I'd say these are very similar in style. I believe they use Cake flour which makes for a lighter fluffier pancakes. It is one of the more expensive breakfast's I've had. But is DC.  This is certainly not the DC 20 years ago. The museums may be free in DC  but be prepared for a $40 t o $50 breakfast for 2.

4.0,4.0,"So close to 5 stars.  The menu is very creative and appeals to any taste.  It's a farm-to-table themed restaurant with mostly comfort food.  The atmosphere is very lively, as this place is almost always packed to capacity.  Coming across a reservation during peak dinner hours is a feat in itself.The food was great.  The drinks were tasty but very weak.  Service was annoying.  Our waitress was extremely pushy.  It was as if she wanted us in and out of there in 15 minutes.  She kept coming to ""check"" on us, and I eventually had to tell her our intent was to take our time and enjoy the meal.  She still made us feel extremely rushed.  She would keep asking us if we're ready to order dinner even though we hadn't received our appetizers or drinks yet.  We eventually gave in, and of course our entrees arrived when we weren't halfway done with the appetizers.We were going to order the beignets for dessert but we were informed by our server that they take 25 minutes to prepare.  Huh?  Why would you have something on your menu with a 25 minute preparation time?  Anyways, if you can get a server that doesn't rush you, it will be a great dining experience.",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Evan M.,"Avon, MA",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,5.0,"Thanks to fellow Yelpers, we were able to find Founding Farmers this past weekend on a trip to DC. The wait can be quite long, so if you don't have a reservation, you can snag a seat at the bar if you're observant (and lucky!)I was already drooling just looking at the cookbook they had on display (which I may need to add to my collection), so by the time I saw the menu, I was ready to eat, calories de damned! We had the super rich Bananas Foster Stuffed French Toast and Beef Pastrami Poached Egg Hash, washed down with a New York Egg Cream and Manhattan Soda (my heart still lies in NY).

4.0,5.0,Best chicken and waffles I've ever had. Chicken was fried perfectly and wasn't too dry. Seasoning was on point. Waffles were crunchy just the way I like them too. I also got their deviled eggs and appetizers. I've never had deviled eggs before this experience. But my first time trying one was pretty good. I love the ambience of this place too. Very casual and laid back. I thought it was cute that the waiters and waitresses all wore plaid button up shirts like farmers.,6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Anna C.,"Orlando, FL",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,5.0,"Particularly excellent for brunch - their stuffed French toast is like a gourmet Twinkie. On my most recent visit, I had the Yankee Pot Roast (which was very good) and my parents each had the Chicken Pot Pie (which they both very much enjoyed).Overall, they have a great range of moderately-priced food made with high-quality ingredients.

4.0,2.0,"Hubby and I went to Founding Farmers this morning with high hopes of a great brunch. We left rather disappointed. We started with the beignets. They were great, aitey and fluffy and dusted in powdered sugar. We got 5 large beignets with carmel, nuttella, and raspberry compote dipping sauce. Coffee and expreso were delish. Hubby got the beef pastrami poached egg hash. His hashbrowns were not crispy and his eggs were very overdone. The ciabatta bread he got with it ended up being a pretty tasteless slice of bread.I had the classic eggs benedict. My eggs were so overdone that they were essentially hard boiled. There was minimal hollandaise which was no longer runny (aka: wasn't very fresh). The ham was just sliced lunch meat. I had it with leak hashbrowns. There was zero seasoning on them. They were crispy on the outside but soggy in the middle. I had to salt the crap out of them to eat half of them. I ate two bites of the eggs bennedict and gave up. Waitress never questioned why we didn't eat. I hate complaining and by that point just wanted to be done.

4.0,4.0,"Excellent brunch spot. Most of the food is buffet style, and some of it they bring around on trays (the fried green tomatoes and eggs Benedict, for instance). The sun tea is excellent. Food highlights included the shrimp and grits and the baked caramelized oranges (it's now my favorite way to eat an orange). The fried green tomatoes were not very good. My one complaint is that the items they bring around come around very infrequently. I asked about the eggs Benedict when I got there since it's my favorite brunch item, was told they'd come by soon, and it was about 1.5 hours later (when I was already completely stuffed) when they finally brought them around (and it was cold).",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Anna F.,"Bellevue, WA",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,4.0,"Make sure to make a reservation in advance! Luckily, I took this step and overheard that a wait for 2 at 4pm would be a 45-minute wait.They stay true to their mantra of ""quality and natural"" ingredients with affordable and delicious farm to table fare. I had their Yankee Pot Roast, which was meaty and moist. The vegetables, mashed potatoes, and gravy that accompanied it had good flavor and texture--I know everyone like to rave about gravy (it was very good), but when vegetables taste savory sweet and aren't cooked to death, I'm the happiest. I rounded out the meal with their fantastic red velvet cake.My husband and I had to be in and out of there fast to catch our flight, and our waitress was friendly and obligingly got us our food and check quickly without rushing us.",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Sophia C.,"Cambridge, MA",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,4.0,"This place is a solid 4.75 stars. I like it, it's priced well, has a good atmosphere, but just lacks a certain UMPH that would push it to a 5 star rating for me. I so badly want to give it 5 stars, and maybe I would if I had had some drinks there because they looked good. That being said, this place is absolutely delicious. My girlfriend and I went on a friday afternoon for lunch, and it was PACKED. I'm very glad we had reservations (I suggest you get reservations - they're not too hard to get). The waiter we had was super nice and toed the line very nicely about how much space to give us so we can enjoy our food but not feel harassed. We ordered:1. Fried chicken and waffles with a side of mac & cheese and mint-watermelon deliciousness. The chicken was THICK but still juicy. This is what a piece of fried chicken should taste like. A definite 5 star rating.2. Goat cheese ravioli with chicken cutlet. My girlfriend ordered this and was very delicious. I think it came with side of mashed butternut squash and it was very delicious. I think this was a solid 4.5-5 stars.3. Hot dogs. We ordered the chicken salad, chili cheese, and bleu cheese with bacon. I actually was too full to eat the last one, but the other 2 were delicious. I brought the last one back to my hotel, and my dad ate it and said it was delicious. This one was a solid 4.5 stars!Highly recommended but remember to make reservations!",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Sangwoo K.,"San Diego, CA",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,5.0,"The food here was soooo amazing! I give this place 4.5 stars. I was visiting from California, and heard so many good things about this place. Originally, my friend and I didn't have reservations, but luckily, we were able to make reservations the night before! Apparently, that is unheard of, and it is almost impossible to get reservations that late. However, the waiter told us if we had one more person, we probably wouldn't have gotten so lucky.I decided to order the chicken and waffles because everyone recommended it for my first time. The chicken was really tasty, the green beans were flavorful, the waffles were light and fluffy, and the mac n cheese was... cheesey. I ate it all and I wasn't uncomfortably full afterwards!

4.0,5.0,"A friend who lives in DC recommended this place. I have never heard of it but it sounded great. It reminded me of the restaurant Booth and Brennan often visit on ""Bones,"" except this one is Farmers not Fathers.Our flights were delayed and we almost missed our reservation. Our hotel told us at check-in to hurry, and they even hooked us up with a car to get there on time as they were impressed that we had reservation and would be able to get in to Founding Farmers. When we got there, the place was packed with people. I understood now how happening this place was. We were seated immediately upstairs and I was so glad we didn't miss our reservation.We made up our mind rather easily on stuff we wanted. My friend, Dita, made up her mind in the car when the bellman told her about the chicken and waffles. I kinda  wavered between the pot roast and shrimps and grits. I had shrimps and grits three nights in a row when I was in South Carolina earlier this week. I was tired of it but for some reasons also couldn't have enough of it. I had different version each night and glad that I ended up going with it here at FF as it was actually my best yet.The chicken and waffles were also some of the best I had. It was comparable to my fave at Table Fifty-Two in Chicago. The waffle just soaked in that awesome vanilla-y syrup. Oh.. It was great to see the syrup quickly disappeared as soon as you poured it. The chicken was fresh and it reminded me of my mom's chicken. They were tiny and not those broiler cuts at the grocery store.We also got fried green tomatoes to start and beignets for desserts. They were both delicious. Especially the beignets. It was worth the 25 minutes wait as they were big, fluffy, airy balls that tasted so good dipped in messy sauces of chocolate, caramel, and strawberry. It was so good that I admitted it tasted better than my homemade beignets. They were sugar glazed too. Balls covered in sugar. I just like balls in general, even without sugar coating it.After the tough travel day with delays and the fact I was at four different airports that day before planting my ass in a chair at FF, it was truly a great treat and a perfect start to our DC vacation. The cocktails were nice as well. Dita ordered a cucumber melon vodka drink and she switched it to my fruity strawberry vodka one. I loved that cucumber cocktail. It was so refreshing. The service was pleasant and prices were way reasonable. We didn't even break $100 before tip. We ordered shitload of foods! I came to learn this place had over 5300 reviews. Mine will get lost in the shuffle but I wanted to get my five star review in no matter what. They deserve it.",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Louise M.,"Minneapolis, MN",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,2.0,Came here during the winter and it was jam packed... Wait took awhile and it didn't open too much before. Must be popular place. While we were waiting I went to bar to grab a coffee... $5?????? Holy crap. The bartender wasn't even pleasant. He seemed to be a jerk. I had told him we were going to be seated soon but would like to wait with a coffee... Finally seated and food came out... Chix and waffles were OK and I had egg omelette no meat. It tasted like bacon. They must use the same grill. Sent it back and same thing. Just dealt with it. Not a good experience at all. The service was friendly that's about it.,6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Nicole A.,"Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, NY",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,3.0,"DO NOT COME HERE WITHOUT RESERVATIONS! I REPEAT DO NOT COME HERE WITHOUT RESERVATIONS!! I came here once and was told the wait would be 45 minutes to an hour. It was around 8 or 9 at that time so I went somewhere else for grub. I made reservations for another time to come back, I'm a huge fan of farm to table so I wanted to see what Founding Farmers was about. I thought it might've been one of the first restaurants that opened up in DC like Old Ebbitt Grill but turns out it's only been around for about 10 years. This place must be crazy good then if the demand for seats are so high. When I finally came for my reservations, I wasn't seated right away.. I even came early and still waited at least 40 minutes. I thought to myself, "" Good food takes time, it's going to be worth it."" When my name was finally called, I was brought upstairs to their booth style seating. I ordered the bacon lollis, prime rib with two sides which were kale and pecan candied sweet potato.The server mentioned to me that they had a special home made soda for the day and it was passion fruit, feeling intrigued I opted for it. Our food took a while to come and we started getting pretty hungry. Luckily the bubbly drink kept us busy. The bacon lollis weren't filling since they were so thin and it was about 4-5 pieces. The steak took a while but it finally came around, it was served with aujus sauce and horseradish sauce. The sides were so and so, I found the sweet potato to be too candied for my liking. The kale was worse, more like what kale?? It was mostly cabbage... and it was pretty tasteless.The main star was definitely the prime rib, the aujus sauce compliments it much better than the horseradish. During midway through our meal we ran out of sauce and wanted to ask our server for more but she was no where to be found. We stopped eating because we didn't want to eat the prime rib without the sauce. We kept looking around for her but she wasn't in sight at all. She hardly checked up on us, when we finally saw her we tried to wait for that ""eye contact"" moment but it never happened so we just politely waited. When she finally came around we got our sauce but it was frustrating that we had to wait this long.. When we finally wrapped up our main course we opted for dessert. We decided on the beignets, they sounded the most intriguing on the menu. Con? It would take about 30 minutes to make and have it served. (SO THAT'S WHY THE WAIT TAKES SO LONG HERE!!! DING DING DING) Luckily I had no other plans later in the evening so I was okay with the wait time. When they finally came, it was presented as powdered sugar donut holes served with 3 sauces. The sauces were raspberry, caramel and chocolate. My favorite was the chocolate. I wish the beignets were softer and less sweet since the sauces were already sweet enough. A few improvements that could be made at Founding Farmers is the service and wait time. Possibly hire more chefs or servers? I feel like they can't seem to handle the overwhelming amount of consumers. It was a long wait to get a table, a long wait for the food and a long wait for service. If they managed the place better with more staff, people would be coming in and out a lot quicker and it would allow them to cater to more people.",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Virginia Y.,"Seattle, WA",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington

4.0,4.0,"What turned out to be a short layover on the way to NC, became a prolonged wait due to inclement weather. I tried airport food, which wasn't very comforting on a rainy day. So, I looked up any restaurant that wasn't far away. It's been awhile since I have been through DC, but I did remember visiting this place awhile back ago. I made reservations (highly encouraged as you will have a long wait) far enough in advance for me to hail a cab, and fight traffic in the rain.Once I arrived, the place was completely packed. Thank God for reservations. I wasn't that hungry, but I did want to try a small meal, with enough room enough left over for what I recall was a delicious skillet of cornbread. I didn't want to wait that long either as it took awhile to get here. Therefore, I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup, and a whole skillet of warm cornbread. Perfect comfort food for an otherwise dismal day.The grilled cheese sandwich was okay. But, the cornbread was heavenly! And with it raining like cats and dogs outside, it was a nice place to hangout for several hours and just people watch.Now, I know why I remembered this place from my previous travels.Just a wonderful, if albeit crowded and noisy place even in the middle of the afternoon.",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Stephen A.,"Phoenix, AZ",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington

4.0,5.0,"Thank you, Yelp, for bringing me to Founding Farmers!! I stopped in here twice on a work trip to DC. Once for brunch and once for supper. Both times the food was exceptional! Really, I concur with most every positive thing others have said about this place.

My spouse commented that he was surprised when he looked up and my plate was almost completely clean. :) He had the Founding Farmers breakfast with a macchiato, and said the bacon and eggs were perfect - he said the bacon tasted like ""campfire bacon"" and that the eggs were some of the best he has ever had. When I went there for supper, I was with some colleagues in a group of about then. We had the friend green tomatoes, skillet corn bread and one of the farm breads - the starters were delicious, you can't go wrong! For the entree, chose one of the specials, trout with red potatoes - double whipped (this was the only downer on the menu, for double-whipped, these potatoes were very lumpy, maybe the double-whipped was ironic?)

Food:We started with the fried green tomato appetizer. It was delicious and came with two great dipping sauces. I got the Spicy Ahi Tuna Poke as my entree and it was okay. A (not too) spicy tuna mix atop a cabbage slaw with triangles of fried tortilla(or something similar). The quality of the tuna was good, but not great, and the slaw was a little too acidic for my taste. My roommate had the lobster mac and cheese. He liked it, but thought the lobster could have been better. Drinks:I had the Martinez cocktail and loved it. I would definitely come back for drinks.Service:There was a bit of a snafu with seating us, as someone else went when they called our name and we ended up getting checked off the list without having been seated.

Founding Farmers is obviously doing something right!We ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes as an appetizer and the Yankee Pot Roast (me) and Southern Pan-fried Chicken and Waffles (hubby) for dinner. The fried green tomatoes were yummy and while they were fairly large, I would've liked a few more on our plate. Nevertheless, they were enough to satisfy our hunger until we got our dinner entrees. I don't like goat cheese so I wasn't a fan of it as a dipping sauce with the tomatoes. However, I did like the green goddess dressing.Where do I begin with the pot roast? I am a LOVER of beef stews and pot roasts or to put it plainly, chunky meats in any kind of liquid/sauce. This dish was simply delectable, particularly with those crispy onions on top! In combination with the ambiance, the pot roast left me feeling all sorts of cozy after my meal. My hubby's chicken and waffles were okay. The chicken seemed a bit dry. The waffles were well made and had the right amount of sweet to them. The mac and cheese was just mac and cheese, pretty good but not memorable.I'd recommend a reservation ahead of time, reviewing the menu while you wait and being ready to order at the table. Grab a drink while you wait for your food and VOILA! You're in for some good eats!",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Sasha P.,"Tampa, FL",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington

You see all walks of life here but mostly business professionals catching a quick bite during their lunch breaks . Which brings me to my next point do NOT go in around noon without expecting to wait a good 45 + minutes so either make a reservation or come prepared to wait.The service was great nothing to get all crazy about.

4.0,5.0,"Listen to everyone and make a reservation. Thank you yelpers for that tip because you saved me literally a 2 hour wait. But if you're in DC visiting, this is a must visit place. Came here for the first time to visit DC, and ever since I went back to Boston, I couldn't stop raving about the food. I honestly had such a good experience here and was pleased with every single thing I got because I consider myself a really picky eater. I love the mission behind this establishment & their sister restaurant ""Farmers Bakers Fishers"" because they work with local farmers or vineyards in different countries/states. But between the two restaurants, Found Farmers wins by far. My friend and I split actually split our meal and we were so full. We ordered the Signature Farmhouse platter: baby cheeseburgers, corn, chili dog, ribs, potato salad. Everything was so good. We also ordered the CORNBREAD. OHMYGOSH. I never ever ever liked corn bread ever until I came and ate theirs. It was the best salted honey buttered corn bread I have ever had in my life. I would take a bus 10hrs just to eat it again. It's so moist in the center, and just so good. & then we finished the evening with their carrot cake that's the size of your head. Really dense, really sweet, really good. We ate it so deliciously that the table next to us asked to order the same things we got. I'm drooling writing this review.",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Tiffany C.,"WEST HILLS, CA",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,3.0,"Let me preface by saying that I've only been here once- this past Sunday (June 28) for a 6:45 dinner reservation. That may have a lot to do with my experience.I made reservations for a party of 4, myself plus three out-of-town guests, earlier in the week prior to Sunday. I heard this place was a zoo, so I thought having reservations would help us navigate the crazy. Nope. If you make reservations, be there at least 15 minutes early, because that's how long it will take you to get seated.Once we got seated, it took forever for our waitress to come over and give us menus. It also took forever to get water, get our entrees, and get dessert. Overall, our dining experience was 2 hours long. Additionally, there were larger parties that were seated after us and left before us. We did not have any substitutions or weird requests, and we did not order appetizers. It took 20 minutes for a beer to get to our table, and over half an hour for dessert. That tells me either our waitress was new (she looked nervous) or there is something systematically wrong with customer volume management at this place.Now for the food. Considering how long it took for everything to get here, I did not honestly think the food was that special. It was tasty, to be sure, and I appreciate their commitment to farm-to-table. However, if people are spending a large part of their evening sitting around waiting for simple things like water and drinks, it better blow my mind, and I just didn't feel that way. My tablemates said the food was good, but it also did not seem to be special to them either.Considering the hype this place gets, plus the fact that this is supposed to be THE place to bring out-of-town guests in DC, Founding Farmers continues the pattern I've noticed of paying through the nose for underwhelming dining experiences in DC. I've heard that going to the other locations and/or for brunch is better, but after my experience, I'm not convinced I want to deal with the crowds and slow service.",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Marissa M.,"Washington, DC",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,2.0,"I'm from Chicago and recently visited here with my sister who lives in DC. This is the only place I feel compelled to Yelp something. I made an 8:45 reservation for 3. Arrived 20 minutes early and was told I'd be seated ""in a few moments."" Great! LOL. Nope! Fast forward nearly an hour before my party was finally seated. It was a Saturday night and they were very clearly overbooked. When we were finally seated it was at a communal table (I hate these) and we weren't given an option. When I asked if we could have our own table they said it would be a longer wait (no thanks). They could tell I was super annoyed (and very hungry) and a manager comped our appetizer. However, didn't bother letting our waiter know and we had to flag him down and tell him. Moral of the story? Food was quite good. Was it worth it? Heck no. If people have reservations they shouldn't be waiting another 45+ minutes. That's ridiculous. And the staff shouldn't continually say ""a few more minutes"" when they know that's not true.

4.0,4.0,"I have no real complaints about Founding Farmers. Went with friends for brunch recently and had an enjoyable meal. The bananas foster stuffed french toast was masterfully prepared. Three french toast 'sticks' were sufficient for a meal (and I was hungry, though I got a side of the apple chicken sausage). A missed star because the benefits of being a 'farm to table' restaurant are a bit lost at breakfast I feel, where there are few vegetable options to choose from. My friends mushroom hash had mushrooms and some spinach, but as seen in the photo, it's mainly a dish full of bland yellow. To comment on the service, the waitress was excellent. I ordered the Farmers tea, thinking it was a hot tea (it's not). Our server replaced it with a delicious Earl Gray White tea with no questions asked, at no additional charge. I'll come back (but probably for dinner, not breakfast).",6584,"Washington, DC",Founding Farmers,Rick S.,"Washington, DC",2028228783,/biz/founding-farmers-washington
4.0,5.0,"This place is fantastic. Everything is fresh, organic, certified green, and whatever else it is that people love these days! It was a Sunday night but we mistakenly tried to get a seat for 2 without reservations, wasn't gonna happen without an hour+ wait. Luckily bar seating was 1st come 1st serve and a couple (my new favorite people) called us aside saying they were just about done so we were quickly seated. To begin, the bartenders were phenomenal! The girls were always smiling and more than willing to help. And they made some good drinks, which is nice considering I would have been disappointed if my $12 Paloma didn't have the taste of tequila in it. The place was packed but our skillet cornbread (only $5!!) was out in a few minutes and main dishes were out within 15. Grilled cheese was so cheesy & delicious, tomato soup was good (can't mess that up or make it too stellar), and the mint watermelon was refreshingly different. $11 for grilled cheese/soup/side was not bad at all. Head over to this place out for any meal of the day!! I hope to go back for brunch, but based in the dinner experience it's gotta be great!

4.0,4.0,"Absolutely fantastic food. I got the oysters and eggs and it was cooked to perfection. It was a strange twist on eggs Benedict with oysters instead of ham. My companion got the standard eggs Benedict and I would recommend both equally. The table next to us got the pumpkin French toast and the smell alone had me drooling. The place was a little too crowded and our waitress was a little too busy to take care of all our needs. She was professional and very sweet but just too busy to remember to fill our waters in a timely manner or bring us our check quickly. Overall I would definitely recommend eating here. Make a reservation first and show up early because it was crazy crowded. Great location across the street from the white house, although you cannot see the Whitehouse from the actual restaurant. There is another building in the way. Lots of historic value if that's something you're into. Although it's only a recreation of the original historic landmark.

4.0,5.0,"What a treat!  To be able to dine in the oldest saloon in DC, and where several US presidents have dined was quite exciting. There was quite a crowd upon arrival at around 6:30pm on a Thursday evening... good thing we had reservations. The ambiance definitely made me feel like I was back in the 1800's-- cherry wood furnishings, wooden beams overhead, and a whole zoo of trophy head mounts lining the walls near the bar.  Overall, this establishment gave off an elegant vibe. I started off with a Mango Martini-- this is made with a fresh mango puree, and you can definitely taste the mango.  This was delicious!The ORCA PLATTER was shared among 3 people, and this was quite filling.  This comes with a lobster, 6 Jonah crab claws, 6 clams, 24 oysters, and 12 shrimp.  Everything tasted fresh, and the lobster meat fell out of it's shell/claws in one piece.  The meat was super tender, and the flavor of the lobster was amazing.  There were 3 kinds of oysters to choose from, so we had them give us 8 of each.  The crab claws were easy to eat, and they were also very good.  I'd say the lobster tasted a lot better, but these were still good.  The clams were sweet and mild-- unlike many raw clams that I've tried.  All of the oysters were shucked perfectly, and I liked that they weren't too fishy or briney.  They all tasted sweet and mild for the most part. I was satisfied with the orca platter, but I wanted to try one of the main courses since we were already there.  The SOFT SHELL CRAB on the east coast doesn't compare to any I've had over here on the west coast.  The crab was super meaty, and you could actually see the white crab meat!  The crab here is huge compared to the tiny, crunchy crabs I've had in Japanese restaurants.  I also tried the CRAB CAKES here, which were amazing!  Each crab cake is thick, and very meaty.  The crab isn't over creamed, and I loved how fleshy the crab cakes were (who likes mushy crab cakes?).  I wish I weren't so overly stuffed, otherwise I would have been able to eat more!.... aaand there's always room for dessert.. Soooooo   :)Again, since we were on the east coast, I had to try one of my favorite desserts: KEY LIME PIE.  This is one of the best key lime pies I've had, other than the one I had in Orlando.  This pie had the perfect amount of lime flavor, and the creamy, smooth texture was on point!  The homemade crust brought it all together.  The Peach Cobbler made the whole meal feel super 'American'-- a warm peach cobbler, served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Nothing feels more like you're in your white friend's family's home than a fresh caked cobbler + ice cream!Definitely coming back here the next time I'm in DC--- the happy hour seems like such a steal for the oysters!",3710,"Washington, DC",Old Ebbitt Grill,Stacey K.,"Irvine, CA",2023474800,/biz/old-ebbitt-grill-washington

Score!  Our bartender was Daniel and he was awesome. Had some local brews and ordered up a salmon burger. It was big and messy and yummy!  We ended our meal with a cheese cake that was excellent.

They have exquisite service and the place is huge, great for large families like mine. They have steak seafood and everything in between, plus their location right next to the White House is great! Lunch atmosphere was more casual. We ate in the atrium dining room. I prefer to eat at the booths in the main dining room. I opted for the Salmon Burger with siracha mayo and seaweed... It was delicious and paired well with fries. Brunch drink menu was also unique with a few mimosa / mojitos but also some creations such as the tequila cooler that I ordered. Had a zing to it!

4.0,1.0,"My husband and I had the worst dining experience here tonight! We got seated and after 20 minutes our server (supposedly it was Derrick) never came to check up on us, so I flagged down a busboy to see if he knew who our server was. The busboy insisted that our server would be coming shortly, so he took our drinks order instead. When the busboy came back with our drinks, he realized that we still hadn't been helped and asked us for our order. The manager came over to clarify our order and we told him that our server never came but he never apologized for it. Our appetizer came out not too long after that but then our entrees took another 40 minutes! The busboy came over to asked if we had gotten our food and we told him no, so he went to go check on it and told us that it should be coming out soon. Our dinner finally arrived about an hour and a half after we had been there. Hey Ebbitt, maybe you guys should just get rid of your servers and promote your busboys instead since they're doing a better job at helping your customers than your actual servers!

I heard about it through reputation and the yelp reviews were many and good. When I walked in I saw a nicely decorated place. The staff was dressed nicely and looked attentive. When we sat down the waiter came over and that's were it went down hill, way down hill, as far as the service. He asked if anyone wanted drinks and in about 10 seconds as we were trying to decide, he rudely huffed and said ok, i'll be back. He and some others from the staff came back with the drinks and then proceeded to talk our orders. I ordered the calamari and lobster pot pie. Have to say that it was one of the best tasting calamari i've had; cooked perfect. The lobster pot pie was delicious and at a reasonable price. As far as the food I was pleased; really pleased if you will. My main issues, and why it was only ok in my book were: 1. It was extremely noisy which is part of the reason I called it touristy and trying to be upscale. 2. The waiter was extremely rude. Saw many times during our meal where he tried to rush us or rolled his eyes waiting for us to decide. This is the main reason for the comment ""tries to hard to be upscale"".

4.0,4.0,"Old Ebbitt is a DC classic! Everyone has to go to Old Ebbitt at least once, especially if visiting the DC area because it is such a well known restaurant. It is very similar to Clyde's if you've ever been to any of their locations except it has a little bit more of an upscale feel. The atmosphere in Old Ebbitt is very nice, it is a bit loud inside but the dim lights with the old feel and decor bring you back in time. This last time I went we were seated outside on the back patio, I had never been seated out there and was pleasantly surprised. If you are with a large group the back outside is the place to be because it is less noisy and you are able to hear everyone.I wouldn't suggest ordering any fancy cocktails here. Nowadays cocktails with fresh ingredients are everywhere and I ordered a cosmo here and all I tasted was the syrup, YUCK! However, they do have plenty of other offerings in terms of wine and beer. Their food is really good. This last time I had the roasted half chicken which was cooked to perfection! It was moist inside and so yummy!! I had a bite of the filet mignon as well and that was magnificent. The service at Old Ebbitt gets a 4.5. Our waiter was very nice and dealt well with out group of 7.

4.0,4.0,"Came here around 1pm on a Friday (yesterday) after a loooong morning (we flew in from California and did A LOT of walking and sight seeing) and thought there would be a long wait since there was a bunch of people loitering outside but nope, we walked in and they were able to seat us right away. Our server's name was Dabra and she was really nice.  She pointed out popular items on the menu along with items that they are known for.  Such as their oysters, which are supposed to be the best in town, and their crab cakes. She also said the swordfish is really good. So we were hungry suckers and ordered everything she mentioned - 1 dozen oysters, crab cakes and the swordfish special.  Everything was delicious and the crab cakes were especially good - the texture was great and if I didn't know any better, I would've thought it was 100% crab. The oysters were fresh but I think I definitely prefer Washington (state) oysters because they are sweeter and are generally a little creamier than other varieties. The ones here are more briney, which is good, but not my favorite - definitely a must try though if you never had oysters here!

4.0,5.0,"This was a good restaurant and could stand on its reputation based on history alone - well, not really.  The food has to be good and it is.  How else could a restaurant be around for over 130 years.  I had a late dinner with friends 10:30 PM.  And the place was going strong.  I ordered the pork chop which came highly recommended by the experience of our waiter.  It was one of the top 2 chops I have ever eaten.  Topped with a olive and pepper tapanade, cooked medium and served with grits and braised chard.  The meal was great, service was excellent and wine pairing was perfect.Afterwards we headed to the bar for a drink.  I ordered a Revolver which a friend had told me about that I have yet to have made according to the bar standards.  The barkeep made one for me with Kailua, eh.  But overall it was not bad.  Still in search of a really good revolver.",3710,"Washington, DC",Old Ebbitt Grill,Tony A.,"San Jose, CA",2023474800,/biz/old-ebbitt-grill-washington
4.0,4.0,"I had heard a lot of hype about Old Ebbitt Grill and knew immediately we had to try it when visiting DC.  For brunch on the weekend around 11 am, the place was packed, but we were lucky enough to get a reservation in advance.  The restaurant is also deceivingly huge and spacious.  Old Ebbitt has a very classy vibe, and service is absolutely impeccable.  Our waiter was very professional and did a great job taking care of our party of eight people.Old Ebbitt is known for their seafood, so I had to try their fried oyster stew.  The fried oysters were really fresh and huge, maintaining their juiciness inside a light and tasty fried coating.  They really reminded me of oysters you get in New Orleans; they were that good.  The stew was creamy, smooth, delicious, and just complemented the oysters so well.  I went with the shrimp and grits, and it was very filling and good.  They give a more than generous amount of shrimp, about 10 pieces of really fresh and perfectly cooked shrimp.  There was also andoille sausage sprinkled throughout all on top creamy grits in a light broth.  The shrimp and grits here are a little bit ""soupier"" than I would have liked because of the broth/sauce they used.  I would have preferred a more creamy and solid based grits, but they were good nevertheless.  I barely finished my plate and didn't eat dinner until late that evening.Overall, I had a great experience at Old Ebbitt.  I will definitely have to come back and try their dinner menu and more of the seafood.  They have some awesome looking seafood specials for happy hour, and I look forward to coming back next time I'm in DC.",3710,"Washington, DC",Old Ebbitt Grill,Vu N.,"Raleigh, NC",2023474800,/biz/old-ebbitt-grill-washington
4.0,5.0,"Wonderful wonderful place. When I arrived at old ebbitt, within 30 seconds of sitting down one of the bus people knocked the table next to mine's red wine all over my purse and dress then it fell and shattered on the ground splashing me even more. This was unfortunate, but my waitress Dirna handled it with grace and offered my boyfriend and myself free glasses of wine and free dessert so it was more than made up for in my opinion. They also offered to pay for my dry cleaning!To the food. It was excellent. We got the crab and artichoke dip to start which was more crab than artichoke which I was pleased with. For our entrees, we got Walters favorite which is a pastrami sandwich and the cannelloni. Both fabulous! The sandwich was piled high with pastrami that was not too salty which some pastrami can be, coleslaw which I don't usually like and loved here, and thousand island dressing that was much better than any I've ever had. The cannelloni was very cheeses, creamy, and tasted perfectly seasoned. We finished off with the caramel cheesecake and it was divine. Just great cheesecake. They even wrote happy birthday in chocolate on the plate. I will definitely return for lunch and happy hour to experience their different menus!",3710,"Washington, DC",Old Ebbitt Grill,Bryn M.,"Arlington, VA",2023474800,/biz/old-ebbitt-grill-washington

4.0,5.0,"Was in town for a business conference and met up with an old college friend at Old Ebbitt Grill. Apparently it's been around forever and used to be the go to spot for all the politicians back in the day. It's literally around he corner from The White House. We made reservations days prior so there was no wait when we arrived but I did notice quite a line of people waiting for seats. The decor is dated and old fashioned and I loved it. It made me feel like Kennedy was going to walk in that door any second and order the crab cakes! Oh the crab cakes. I think it brought tears to my eyes. First of all, I'm allergic to shellfish but I would gladly eat these crab cakes for the rest of my life. It was so flavorful and full of real crab meat. You can order one or get a better deal for the two. It was a decent size, not too small like most crab cakes. I ended dinner with the key lime pie which was perfect. It's hard to get key lime pie wrong. Will def go back the next time I'm in town!",3710,"Washington, DC",Old Ebbitt Grill,Vanty D.,"Poway, CA",2023474800,/biz/old-ebbitt-grill-washington
4.0,4.0,This place has the old rustic feel to it and i'm guessing they expanded into an office space atmosphere in the back. There's a lionhead fountain which kept the area nice and cool especially after walking to all the monuments on this ridiculously humid summer day. We were seated promptly by the host with no wait and no reservation even though the restaurant seemed full and it was prime time Saturday dinner service. A nice plus!The menu seemed to have a lot of choices which didn't seem to stand out to me.   However i decided to get the double crab cakes. The crab was great! moist in the inside with a nice texture from the lightly fried exterior. It is served with a light cream sauce and quinoa just to make the meal a little more filling. I also decided to get a glass (mason jar) of white sangria ($8). It was great! Wasn't overly sweet yet had a refreshing kick to it to compliment my meal.

Filling, no doubt.  However I'm not a fan of having to pick meat off the bones and these wings weren't meat-heavy so that was a little bit of a downer.Eggs Chesapeake - jumbo lump crab cakes on english muffins.  Not a huge crab fan, yet these were outstanding!Eggs Benedict - I didn't try this one personally, but my friend said it was one of the best he'd ever had.

4.0,3.0,"I was very excited to try Old Ebbitt and I'm glad I did - I just don't think it's the best there is in DC. My husband ordered off the $22 lunch restaurant week menu which included fried green tomatoes, shrimp & grits, and key lime pie. The fried green tomatoes were a big highlight with perfectly crispy fried tomatoes. The corn relish on top, like most other things we tried at the restaurant, were on the bland side and needed more flavor. The shrimp of the shrimp and grits was perfectly cooked but lacked flavor and the grits were really chunky with a tomato-based (and flavor-lacking) sauce. The key lime pie was good and flavorful except it came with a slice of regularly lime which makes me wonder if it was just lime pie instead of key lime pie...I ordered the Eggs Chesapeake and was really impressed with the cook on everything. The english muffin was very crisp, the crab cake was also well cooked, and the poached egg was perfect. Although the texture when eating the meal was fantastic, the flavors just weren't there. All in all, I think it's worth a try at least once. They seem to cook things really well, I'd just really like them to spice things up a bit.",3710,"Washington, DC",Old Ebbitt Grill,Kimberly S.,"Seattle, WA",2023474800,/biz/old-ebbitt-grill-washington

The others all finished their meals, ate everything, maybe could have had a few more oysters in that meal but otherwise all as expected. Had a variety of servers, team service helping bus plates, filling drinks etc, had everything we wanted promptly, just what we wanted after a day of sightseeing.

From the fresh flowers, to the lit candles in the chandeliers you feel like you're in a movie from the early 1900's. It's perfect! The desert menu made it very difficult to decide but finally we went with the key lime pie, and warm strawberry rhubarb with vanilla ice cream. Both were PHENOMENAL!  The wine list was robust and their cocktails were classic. Everything about this place was amazing.

4.0,5.0,"Great place! Try to get reservations! This place gets packed pretty fast even though it's a huge establishment. So, if you know you're going here, call in advance. If you're a walk-in there are 4 bars that you can go to, that you can get a drink or some apps. And they're spread around the restaurant.The Old Ebbitt Grill is a historic establishment even though it moved from it's original location, but it has the old American sort of feeling inside. There's beautiful paintings and furniture all over the restaurant. The ""outside"" area, which is like a lobby to the building it's attached to, has more seating. Mostly for larger groups and private events. The atmosphere is quite classy, but not super upscale. And there's no actual dress code, but it's nice to dress it up a little for dinner.I had reservations for 10:15PM, which was way too late, so we thought it didn't hurt to go as a walk-in. Came in around 6-ish and they said 2 hours wait. Well better than 4 hours. So my party and I, went to the bar, and grabbed a few drinks. Even though getting a seat at the bar can be difficult as well. But people are nice and aren't hounding for a seat. They gave us buzzer and it buzzed around 7-ish, which was like an hour wait. Great and our table was in the same area as the bar we were drinking at. Our waiter was very nice and answered all of our questions. He checked up on us from time to time and asked how was everything. He small talked with us. Superb service. (oh and the bartender took so many drink orders, remembered the order, and was so professional, it was amazing).Overall, the food is delicious! Decadent!! Everything I ate was very good! Nothing too ordinary! I had raw oysters for the first time, it tasted good. There's a few selections may be good for first timers cause there's less slimy oysters to try. You also get a free cheese, artichoke dip with bread. Yum. Here's a list of what was ordered.

We did this and they seated us right away! We went for lunch in our regular tourist attire. In hindsight I would recommend that you reserve you eating time, lunch or dinner and dress accordingly. The environment is rich with art, hardwoods, etc. Great date night place! Basically, for you Texans a notch or two above Sunday best. If you do however just drop in tourist clothes and all they will not turn you away:)The food, I had the Pit-Style Roast Beef. It wast tender and succulent with a great barbecue sauce. I could tell it was made in house. What cinched the sandwich for me was the fried onion on top! They were fried pieces of delight. A friend ordered the Southern Fried Porkchop! It was my favorite. I had the honor of trying a few bites! It was fried to perfection, paired with fried eggs and a gravy sauce. The cornbread was lightly sweet and grilled with the perfect amount of golden brown, you know there is flavor there! The potato salad is killer!

This is definitely not an entree where Old Ebbitt Grill shines - the liver was tough and overcooked, and not seasoned well. My friend ordered the filet mignon, which was much better, but still seemed underseasoned to me.For the food we got, I felt that Old Ebbitt Grill was a bit pricey.

For the most part he paid no attention to us (at one point we were looking everywhere for him and he was at the bar watching the football game!), never refilled our glasses with wine or water, continuously reached over us while we were eating to clear the table WITHOUT saying ""excuse me""... We notified the manager, however, who was extremely nice and understanding about the situation.As for the food: my two friends had the chicken and said it was to die for. I, on the other hand, had a dozen of the happy hour oysters which were amazing. I also had the lobster bisque which was excessively salty, so the waiter recommended swapping it out for the clam chowder which was much better.I would definitely go back, request a different waiter, and not get the lobster bisque.

4.0,4.0,"We had a delicious and filling brunch here on July 4th. Luckily we made reservations, because this place was busy! The restaurant was completely full despite how huge it is (you would never know from the outside). We were sat at the back of the restaurant by a really cool fountain and it was a very relaxing atmosphere. The service was very good. Our server was friendly and he always made sure our coffee mugs weren't empty. Despite having a big party of 8, the food came out quickly and it was all delicious! I ordered the Oyster Stew to start. It is cream based and was rich in flavor. The oysters were fried to perfection and it provided a nice crispy contrast to the creaminess of the soup. I would order this again in a heartbeat. For my entrée, I ordered the chicken and waffles. Good thing I came hungry, because it was a huge portion. It was a whole fluffy Belgian waffle and 2 big pieces of fried chicken. Luckily I had some help from the rest of my family to finish it all. The fried chicken was crispy and I liked that the breading actually stuck to the chicken, as opposed to a lot of places where the skins falls right off. I tried the shrimp and grits too. It was not what I am used to when it comes to grits because it wasn't as thick and it was a little soupier, but still good. Old Ebbitt Grill does have a happy hour every day where you can get half priced seafood, but unfortunately reservations for that time slot was filled up.

4.0,3.0,"Came here on the 4th of July. We walked all the way from the Lincoln memorial to this restaurant after a crazy storm that soaked all of us. We smelled bad, and had wet muddy shoes. I had a headache, probably from starvation, but we couldn't have finished our D.C. trip without going to one of the most oldest and historic restaurants in the city. My entree was the Duroc Pork Chop and when it came out it didn't look nearly as good as other Yelper's photos. I should have taken a photo, but I was way too hungry. The pork chop was pale in comparison to others. The pork chop was A-OK and wasn't too flavorful. The meat was a bit dry. The dish costed about $19. The pork chop was complimented with grits, which was really good. The dish looked like a lot, but I wasn't full after eating it. I snarfed it down probably less than 10 mins. Keep it mind though, I was starving. Luckily all that protein kept me alive until the fireworks started at ~9PM. The service was slow, but I guess that was expected because it was the 4th. It took them a very long time to get us our booze. We waited maybe 30mins and thats a too long for an alcoholic like me.  Overall, it was nice to see and eat at such a historic place.

4.0,2.0,"The wait staff is disrespectful at Old Ebbitts Grill. We went to Clyde's Willow Creek Farms in Ashburn and got the same special with very good service a couple of weeks ago.  Our experience at Old Ebbitts Grill confirmed it has gone downward through the years.  The waiter called me ""honey,"" I am a mature woman and it was demeaning. I spoke with the Manager, Paul Hawkins. Mr. Hawkins defended the waiter and saw nothing wrong with calling a mature woman doctor ""honey,"" even though I expressed it was offensive to me in the manner it was said. Why would I want to return to Old Ebbitt's Grill with so many excellent food with great service in DC and local area.? I do not want to!

4.0,4.0,"OEG seemed to just fit perfectly.I was looking for something in between the Washington Monument and Ford's Theater that would be open for brunch around 10am on a Sunday and across the Internet OEG kept coming up as a classic/timeless DC spot so to Opentable I went to make the reservation.Service:  Overall pretty good but there is an issue which keeps this place from being five stars that I'll get to in a moment.  We were promptly seated in nice booth and our guy ""C"" gave us a nice walk thru of the menu including house specialties along with his personal favorites.So far so good, right?  So what could be the issue?  The issue is that OEG for brunch (maybe it's different other times/days) is very, very slow.  Do not come here if you need to be somewhere in a hurry because you'll never get there as the pace is leisurely at best.  Now when I say leisurely I should preface it by explaining that part of it was because by 11am the place was packed (even though we got there an hour prior it shouldn't have mattered but after an hour we had just gotten our entrees) and ""C"" kept stopping to talk with people who I guess are regulars.  More than once I heard a ""See you next week Mr. X"" or even a ""See you tomorrow Mr. Y"".Again, not snobby or nasty just each server had too many tables and they were being far too cordial with people they knew which slowed it down big time for the rest of us.Food:  For DC the adult menu prices are not outrageous and it's nice with brunch that you can go anywhere from apple French Toast, to a burger to oysters and everything on the menu in between.The kids' meals were pedestrian as nothing was any different than what you would have found at a chain like Friday's or a Red Robin except for charging the satanic price of $9.50 for a PB&J.  The old lady hit some type of quiche and I did the crab cake sandwich. The portion size on both the quiche and the crab cake were fairly small but both had decent flavor.  I'm a quasi-crab cake snob and while this wasn't the best that I've ever had it was a solid attempt that I would get again if we ever came back.The kid's meals come with ice cream so we shared the Bourbon Walnut Pie.  The pie was not really my choice so while it was alright you best like chocolate and you best like a dessert that is heavy.  Also on the dessert minus a star against ""C"" for never bringing a second spoon when he said that he would do it three times but never did.I get it why this place has over 3K reviews on Yelp because it has a great location, wide menu choices which are executed well and the décor is nice but not stuffy or pretentious.  I would come back no problem but I would need to remember to allow for a solid 90-120 minute experience or else we'd be late for whatever came next.",3710,"Washington, DC",Old Ebbitt Grill,Christopher C.,"Conshohocken, PA",2023474800,/biz/old-ebbitt-grill-washington
4.0,3.0,"3.5 stars. Come here for the establishment. Building is old and pretty, yo.Atmosphere: Came to visit sister in D.C. and planned for a nice Saturday night dinner to celebrate a belated birthday. Made reservations, of course. It's very busy in the evenings, but also very dim and intimate. It's a nice environment.Food: Bread and butter here on point - soft and warm bread, yum yum. Opted for the New York Strip Steak. It was good, but not the best steak I've had. It was definitely filling, though, The potatoes that accompanied it were really great though. Some parts were crispy and some softer, and I was all about it. My sister and her bf really enjoyed their dishes as well. I think he said it was the best pork chop he's ever had (will confirm). For dessert we had the blondie sundae and JESUS THAT IS SWEET. It was really good though - a slight deviation from the usual brownie sundae but still cookie/brownie-like and delicious. We finished every last bit of it despite how full we were. The prices here are heftier than usual restaurants. We also had cocktails but they weren't very memorable to me.Service: Great! our waitress was really funny and sweet and attentive.",3710,"Washington, DC",Old Ebbitt Grill,Tiffany O.,"Newark, NJ",2023474800,/biz/old-ebbitt-grill-washington
4.0,2.0,"My wife wanted to try this place when her friends came and visited dc and read the positive reviews. Food was ok, but was over priced. Maybe bc they were busy but took me twice to ask for refill on my water whenever the server came by. Had the crab cake eggs Benedict and their jaleneno burger and ordered the grill cheese for my kid. Other than it being overpriced $9 for a grill cheese sandwich which was pretty much a very thick slice of bread with slice of cheese barely melted and tater tots which both was cold by the time they served us didn't want to bother sending them back and waiting longer for my kids food.

4.0,3.0,"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about this place. It could be that I'm a vegetarian and although they have some vegetarian dishes, they seem to be an after though.I ended up ordering appetizers because I didn't want their portabello mushroom sandwich. I had their zucchini fries - these were good, but the dipping sauce was meh. I got a cup of their roasted summer veggie soup - it was thick and a bit spicy (this is a plus). However, they served it with oyster crackers, when it needed some nice warm bread, which they delivered after I requested.  My friend ordered the cheese burger sliders and said that they were really good. Another friend got the vegetarian sandwich as well as the peach cobbler.  The peach cobbler was a disappointment - not very cobbler like if you're expecting sweet crumbly topping.  This was like a doughy dish with some peaches in the center.  Everything was quite pricey.  Service was slow and inattentive, but we weren't expecting much when we realized how big this place is....and they set us in the back.  I agree with Kelvin C. who said that it felt like eating in a fancy nursing home.",3710,"Washington, DC",Old Ebbitt Grill,Linda S.,"Lakewood, CA",2023474800,/biz/old-ebbitt-grill-washington

4.0,3.0,"Some of my family was in town and we made reservations here.  Let me tell you, reservations are definitely encouraged because it seems like this is the hot spot to go.  It definitely has a lot of history to it.  We were seated in the back of the restaurant towards the bar, which honestly was a little quieter than in the main restaurant because it gets really loud.  After we sat down, the server immediately brought us waters and bread.  We ordered our drinks and then looked over the menu.  I was debating between a few items and asked what the server recommended.  He told me that the crab cakes are very good and to try those.  Before our food arrived, we all had finished our drinks, and it was a good 10 minutes before he came back to ask if we wanted refills.  (We did.)  Then it took another good chunk of time to get our drinks.  We got our food and everything looked delicious.  My crab cakes were okay.  They were each pretty large in size, but they were not very flavorful.   The crab cakes were close to $30 and I don't think they were worth the price.  It was a family member's birthday and the server brought out a blondie covered with whipped cream and a candle.  The blondie was really good and if I ever come back, I will definitely be getting dessert.  This experience was okay.  The service was slow, but as I said before they were very busy.  It is a historical place and is very DC.",3710,"Washington, DC",Old Ebbitt Grill,Angela E.,"Alexandria, VA",2023474800,/biz/old-ebbitt-grill-washington

4.0,5.0,"Had a fantastic experience here last night. We had a reservation for 8:30, but popped in about an hour early and posted up at the bar. They have a great bear selection with some local craft beers. I thought the DC Brau was fantastic. They also have rip/pappy van winkle which is incredibly difficult to find anywhere. After some beer and whisky we headed to our table. We kind of built our own multi course meal... Since the table was so small they brought everything out individually. We started with the clam chowder, it was great - only feedback is it could of been hotter.Next were grilled oysters - I thought they were fantastic, great flavor for grilled oysters.Then steamed mussels - how these bad boys are only $11 is beyond me. They were fantastic and that bread + broth is something else.We shared the crab cakes - they are legitimately the best crab cakes I've ever had! We each ordered a 5oz filet - it's on special in July and only $15!! 15 DOLLARS?!? Our steaks were each cooked perfectly and had great flavor. We ended the meal with pie, ice cream and Irish coffee. We went big with this meal and every course was absolutely fantastic... I would love to do this meal all over again. Service was on point throughout.

4.0,4.0,"A very posh restaurant, yet welcoming of the casual dress style. This is definitely a place I would take a few friends who were visiting D.C. for the first time. What makes this a group-friendly place is the attentive staff and the menu-variety.The only issue I have is very tiny, but I believe it affects the integrity of the restaurant. I checked my receipt against my account and was charged an extra dollar on the tip. It may have been a careless mistake or done purposefully; whichever possibility, we rely on great restaurants and their staffs to be accurate and not have invidious motives. The happy hour menu tops those of other seafood happy hour spots I have indulged in. The price of the orca platter (about $63) is beyond generous for the wonderful mix of: 2 dozen oysters, a dozen jumbo shrimp, half a dozen clams, half a dozen crab claws, and, to top it all off, a meaty lobster--shareable and delicious.Oh, and the White House is next door.",3710,"Washington, DC",Old Ebbitt Grill,An Thien T.,"Anaheim, CA",2023474800,/biz/old-ebbitt-grill-washington
4.0,2.0,"I am not sure what happened with using Open Table to make a reservation. I gave the hostess my name a few minutes before 11 am and she completely botched everything. From not understanding that I had a reservation to not understanding that it was for four people and that I requested a high chair to not understanding my name, she got everything wrong multiple times.Our server seemed a little pushy in terms of ordering. He asked us about starters and drinks and desserts but I thought it was clear we weren't interested in ordering much. The food was fine. I ordered the Healthy Choice and thought the turkey sausage was dry. The spinach and egg white omelette lacked flavor and the fruit cup was an interesting combination of tiny red grapes, pineapple, blood orange, tangerine, cantaloupe, and pear. The place was packed when I arrived, which I was surprised to find because it was so cold, icy, rainy, and slushy outside. I was definitely disappointed by the food but the booth in the corner with the big windows made up for it. It is also nice that they have hooks near each booth to hang up things, but for those with small children and strollers and walkers, it is not the easiest to maneuver. (Restrooms are downstairs, and to get in and out with strollers, you have to move huge planters that block the ""normal"" doors.

4.0,5.0,"If you are coming to DC for the first time and want to try a classic DC restaurant, Old Ebbitt Grill is a must. Its style has an iconic old tavern meets Victorian feel. The staff here is very efficient and polite. I came here for an 8 pm reservation and was seated on time. Old Ebbitt is known for their oysters, so if you are a fan of oysters, you have to order them here! My table started out with a dozen oysters ($29.95). Sometimes oysters can be a little off, but these were perfection.Next, I ordered the Alaskan King Salmon entree salad ($18.95). At first, when I saw the price, I assumed that because OEG is an upscale restaurant, they could get away with charging a hefty sum for a salad, but I was thoroughly impressed with my entree salad. The fillet of salmon was very large and I could barely finish my salad. It was so delicious that I tried to recreate it last night for dinner. I had a very pleasant experience at Old Ebbitt and I didn't feel rushed at all during my meal. I would definitely recommend this place to any out of towners looking to get a bite after sightseeing all day - after all, it is very close to the White House. The ambiance is slightly upscale, so I would recommend changing from casual wear, but there is no real dress code and I saw plenty of people in casual wear.After dinner, wander over to the rooftop bar at the W (just around the corner) for an amazing view of DC.",3710,"Washington, DC",Old Ebbitt Grill,Norah C.,"Washington, DC",2023474800,/biz/old-ebbitt-grill-washington

Felt like I was dining in a fancy nursing home or something. The menu was limited, idk if it depend on time or day but a lot of what I saw in the pictures didn't seem to be available when we went. I had the stuffed French toast, which was great but a bit on the sweet side for me. Also, the it was the most different looking stuffed French toast I've had. It was more of a breakfast dessert. My girl had steak and eggs and it was good. Nothing special to really say about this place. It has history and is a popular tourist spot I believe but it offers nothing to rave about other than to say you've been there too. There was an older man who may be the boss who was nice and chatting people up which is always a good thing.

4.0,5.0,"Last time I visited DC we decided to go big and visit 4 restaurants and the National Zoo in only 8 hours. Old Ebbitt Grill was our third stop in DC and we had never been so thankful to have reservations in our life. The line for Old Ebbitt Grill was out the door and thanks to our OpenTable reservations we only waited 10 min. After already hitting up ShopHouse and GBD Fried Chicken & Doughnuts we had to dig deep down into our hunger reserves to clear space for an amazing dinner.Old Ebbitt Grill is the oldest restaurant in DC and one of the Oldest Restaurants in America. With its legendary history and diverse menu it was an easy pick for ending our day in DC.... well almost, we hit up Baked & Wired right after but that was just for a quick sweet tooth fix before leaving DC for good.Ella got the Pumpkin Ravioli with sherried onions, roasted butternut squash, wilted Swiss Chard, and cranberry-sage butter. She really liked how sweet the pumpkin was and how it blended well with the tartness of the cranberry-sage butter.Anyone that knows me knows I DONT EAT SEAFOOD... but for some reason I was feeling extra adventurous tonight and couldn't stop eyeing the Grilled Atlantic Swordfish with tomato confit, sautéed spinach, potato croquette, and arugula pesto. It may be the biggest cliché in the world but for my first experience with Swordfish it taste just like chicken. The taste, texture, aroma, it was all chicken and I loved every single last bite of it. The best thing on the plate wasn't the Swordfish though... it was the tomato confit with the potato croquette. Those two flavors swimming around in my mouth were the best in DC and the only thing I've ever eaten that came close was dinner night at our (chef) friends house :)Old Ebbitt Grill has been around for over 100 years and won't likely be going anywhere in the next 100 years.

Upon entering i was intrigued by the old school waiter attire and old school Chicago mob style looking dining room. that was sadly where my excitement ended. The greeter walked us through the dining room and around the corner to the back atrium area. There was a weird fountain and the dining area back there seemed super out of place. Reminded me of a run down mall food court. From my seat i gazed into the awesome looking bar. I felt like the kid who got picked last in gym class out there.

One bit of warning...   the oysters are very salty if you are accustomed to Gulf or FL oysters you will not like them.   They are New England oysters and even though they warn about the ""briny"" taste....they are ALL salty.We shared entres after and the meatloaf was huge and delish as was the pork loin. Take a moment to walk around between courses and check out all the rooms.  The artwork on the walls is simply amazing.   Want a totally different feel, then eat in the garden..... atrium of a building is converted into an indoor garden restaurant.

Diners are served amazing bread to start the dining experience. Waiters are on point and constantly refilling water and drinks.

4.0,4.0,"Made a reservation for 9pm  for 5ppl based on a friend's recommendation. I came here with my family for dinner.Food:  We ordered crispy pork shank appetizer,  clam chowder soup. In addition, we ordered the New York steak, pork shop , riot burger,  seared salmon burger , and braised short ribs.  The appetizer came 11 min after we put in our order.  Then our entree came 19 min after we put in our order. The appetizers were pretty amazing. I wish we had more of it.  However, I was not impressed by their clam chowder soup. I expected better to be more flavorful and not as water down.   As for the entree,  The burger was cooked and seasoned beautifully.  The seared salmon burger came out very delicious w the seaweed salad. The braised short ribs was seasoned well.  However, I can tell the quality of meat that was used , was mediocre.  I wish they used a better type of meat for quality purposes, especially at that price range.   3.5/5 Atmosphere: this place is ridiculous huge. It is decorated extraordinary well. I love the set up of the bar and multiple dining rooms. The space is utilized to its maximum capacity. It was done very efficiently. This place can easily hold over 160 people for dining.  4.5/5 Service: great service to start with,  we were sat down right away.

4.0,4.0,"Old Ebbitt is known for being touristy and crowded, but the food is legitimately great, making it worth a stop even for locals. The raw bar is good and very similar to its sister restaurant Clyde's - good selection, good happy hour prices, and fresh. The prices are pretty reasonable for everything, with entrees hovering around $15-20. I highly recommend trying the Wagyu Beef Pot Roast! So rich and tender and only $15.  Make reservations and/or be prepared to wait a bit to be seated. Old Ebbitt usually draws a crowd. The hostess will give you a buzzer - but the bar area gets packed with people getting drinks while waiting.",3710,"Washington, DC",Old Ebbitt Grill,Amber G.,"Arlington, VA",2023474800,/biz/old-ebbitt-grill-washington

You can always expect great service with pretty good prices. It's extremely hard to find jumbo shrimp at such a discounted price (my fave) and Old Ebbitt always has it discounted during their late night happy hour.

4.0,3.0,The cook has a heavy hand with the salt. The place itself is really nice. Great for a hangout with friends or family. A huge space. Cocktails were pretty good. Definitely a place for tourist to stop by for reasonably priced eats. Just need to tell them no salt and add your own....

4.0,3.0,"Just ok. After reading the menu and high Yelp ratings, a friend and I came here for a much needed night out during a long 12 day work trip. We both started with the oyster stew. It was hot, creamy (not overly so) and the oysters tasted fresh. We both agreed, it was delicious. I ordered the baked fish and chips as an entire. The Cod had nice texture and flavor, although it wasn't any less greasy than fried.  The fries were fresh-cut, soggy and a little cold, but had a decent taste. My friend ordered the flank steak as her entire. It was chewy and had a horrible, bitter charred taste. But what was worse, it had absolutely no seasoning. It was truly awful. The sides of Groton-potatoes and sautéed spinach, were fairly good, albeit greasy.  For dessert:The crème brûlée, had almost no caramelization on top. It was thick and cold, more like flan. The pumpkin bread pudding, had a decent taste but was heavy as a brick.  Overall, just ok. It's not expensive, but for quality and taste, still overpriced.

We sat at the bar for a couple of drinks and the bartender, Larry, was amazing! He was so accommodating and friendly. My friend and I were talking about how we felt like we should be drinking an Old Fashioned being in a place like Old Ebbit Grill, and Larry overheard us and came back with the drink for us! We stopped by the next day in the late afternoon/early evening for some food which was good, but the Butterscotch Blondie Sundae is absolutely divine.

4.0,3.0,Stopped in on a cold Saturday in DC before heading to the Warner theater. It is nearby to the theater so it's a prime spot for many landmarks and activities. The restaurant was cold because the revolving doors kept spinning due to the constant flow of people getting lunch. Luckily we had gotten in without an prior reservations or wait. We were seated a a half booth half regular table. This style is not my favorite because about 3/4 in our meal we had another couple that sat in the booth/table next to us. They were a little too close for my comfortable because I could hear their entire conversation and I assume they could mine.Since it was lunch time we decided on sandwiches and fries. My husband got the riot burger and I must say this is a must order. The riot burger has fried oysters & delicious bacon. This burger is no joke in size and must be cut in half to eat. I ordered the seared salmon burger and was a little disappointed. It was a decent size burger but the salmon burger seemed to have a lot of filler and it was more like a crab cake. I thought it was a little bit too fishy and I love salmon. I would probably try some thing else next time.,3710,"Washington, DC",Old Ebbitt Grill,Amanda K.,"Fairfax, VA",2023474800,/biz/old-ebbitt-grill-washington

It was so busy and bustling, they have is a buzzer and we waited about 5 minutes. Once we were seated our waitress came over, poured some water and explained the history of the restaurant then told us the menu favourites. We ordered some cocktails and mulled over the menu for a little longer.We opted for the famous crab cakes with quinoa and the Parmesan crusted trout. While waiting for our meal, fresh warm bread and butter came to the table. Nice touch. On to the meals: they were both perfection! I was blown away by the crab cakes. No cheap filler, this was all beautiful crab meat. We can highly recommend both of these meals! We finished with dessert. The bourbon chocolate pecan pie with ice cream and the salted caramel cheese cake. Omg yum!! Both came highly recommended by our waitress. We had an amazing meal here and can not recommend it more. For the two of us, mains, dessert and 3 cocktails it came to $120 including tip.",3710,"Washington, DC",Old Ebbitt Grill,Jess U.,"Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia",2023474800,/biz/old-ebbitt-grill-washington

I appreciated the compassion and for being so attentive to our situation!I had the eggs Benedict and it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly. The restaurant was busy during Sunday brunch, but it's a fairly large restaurant and we had no problem being seated promptly after arriving.

4.0,5.0,Had this place bookmarked as part of my DC visit.  Came here for dinner after going to the white house. The place was a lot larger than I expected.  The decor is meant to be old school but everything is kept up very nicely. There are four bars and we opted for the bar to the left side of the entrance. Our bartender Joseph was incredibly nice.  His service was excellent and he humored my history questions. I had a half dozen kusshi (sp?) oysters to start. My entree was the shrimp linguine which had perfectly cooked al dense pasta.  Extensive menu and a place with great history.,3710,"Washington, DC",Old Ebbitt Grill,Michelle T.,"Costa Mesa, CA",2023474800,/biz/old-ebbitt-grill-washington
4.0,5.0,"There are places that do a decent job, and expect a 5 star review. Then there is the cut above, the places that just rock it no matter what. The issue is discerning between the two as a reader. So the Old Ebbitt is the latter. This place is rocking, but that doesn't mean they settle for less or reduce their service because they can. I sat at the bar and ordered wine. $8 a glass totally affordable considering the locale. In fact I think the bartender may have swayed me toward the better Hess affordable one. Then the heirloom salad. Amazing flavors... Balsamic, basil, mozzarella... Yes easy but not always knock-it-out-of-the-park good. This was. And then... The crab cakes? Wonderful mix of flavors. No detail is overlooked. Of important note!!! My crab didn't arrive suddenly 3 bites into my salad. PLANNING was in play! Subtle flavors everywhere.  These folks work hard here to make it special.

4.0,5.0,"This was one of the best breakfasts I have had in a while! We donated and walked the St. Jude event in DC's National Mall and needed a good bite to eat on a chilly morning. We used Yelp to find this place and the reviews were accurate.I ordered pumpkin french toast that was dipped in pumpkin batter, along with a seasonal winter drink (I forget the name). The food was excellent! Flavorful, fast, and fun.We actually ordered a morning cheese plate appetizer that was also very enjoyable and fresh. My friends accompanying me ordered mimosas and a variety of creative quiche dishes. All of the food was EXCELLENT.The decor was great too. They have a huge wooden bar, very tall ceilings, padded booths, marble restrooms, and the crowd on a Saturday morning is a chirpy collection of tourists and locals.I highly recommend this place for breakfast, and I feel confident with assuming all other menus offer the same quality and creativity.",3710,"Washington, DC",Old Ebbitt Grill,Michael G.,"Baltimore, MD",2023474800,/biz/old-ebbitt-grill-washington
4.0,4.0,Very cool restaurant. There are 2 sections of the restaurant. One section is the actual restaurant. The section I was seated in was in the lobby of the building. The only pro was that it was quieter. They made an effort to make the atmosphere feel like part of the restaurant but you can tell a huge difference in the actual restaurant and the lobby. If I visit again I will request to be seated in the actual restaurant when I make my reservation. And MAKE A RESERVATION. We called a week in advance and the only time available was 8:30(we were a party of 6 though).The food was really good. I ate the Chicken Fettuccine and had the Butterscotch Blondie Sundae.

4.0,4.0,"I've been to Old Ebbitt Grill twice already over the several amount of times that I visited DC and it never fails me. It's a definite classic and must try if you're in the area. It's always packed so try to get a reservation if possible. In terms of the building, it's absolutely beautiful. You can already get a glimpse of the restaurant feel with the beautiful gold lettering on the outside building that says ""Old Ebbitt Grill"". The inside is even better. Everything has this classy feel to it even though it's old. You can tell how old it is because the marbling on the staircase where you walk is slanted down from the erosion overtime. There's another room all the way on the inside and it's so pretty. It opens up real bright with natural lighting and I remember there being palm trees in there? And other plants that made it look almost like a jungle. The gold details just make it look very elegant. But what's great is that although everything looks very expensive, prices for the food here are very doable. You don't even have to dress up all nice. Casual should be just fine or even Sunday's best. All the staff members tidy up real nice and I love that everyone is in uniform. Service here is also very top notch and attentive. Here's what I ordered:-Clam Chowder-Crab and Artichoke Dip-Fish and Chips-Baby Back Ribs-1/2 Dozen OystersEverything was pretty tasty (but nothing to absolutely die for) especially the crab and artichoke dip YUMMY! The menu here is pretty extensive and will satisfy to anyone's palette.

The second, I got their dish of fried oysters egg benedict. It was the best brunch I've ever had. The oysters were fried perfectly, and all of the flavors and textures were amazing. Aside from the food, the atmosphere is really cool. It's casual, but has a lot of history. This is the oldest restaurant in D.C., and presidents used to hang out here.

The food is good and the old-DC atmosphere is really unique and it's a good spot for a fancier dinner on the town.The last time I was at Ebbitt I had a negative experience with a waiter that really influenced my opinion of the restaurant. A small group of friends got together to celebrate my roommate's birthday here, and we were very polite and quiet and generally good customers but the waiter didn't show us the same respect. He started being very rude to us when he found out we would not be ordering alcohol and his attitude persisted throughout the meal. At one point in the night, I asked him if they did anything special for birthdays (he said they did) and let him know it was my friend's birthday and we would like to have them do a cake or song or whatever they do there. He walked away without response and he never delivered on any birthday treatment, which was particularly awkward because several tables around us were cake delivered and things for other birthdays. It was quite embarrassing.The food is good, but it's very loud and dark in there and the meals are definitely overpriced for the quality.

4.0,4.0,"Honestly this place is pretty cool have a group friends shared drinks and a good plates.We order the pig's head, let me tell you, it was a lot of food, especially if you are familiar with a pig's autonomy. Our waitress told us it was a appetizer size, she was so wrong, and good thing we ordered a little food to see how it goes, and we still ended up stuffing our face. The food overall is good, and of course the highlight is the pig's head, you have to call ahead and order it, and it was $60 for an adult one, and I would say enough for 6 people if you order some sides to go with it. We did get some skin and our friends were brave enough to eat the tongue, but yub, tons of food, and just a good time.As you expected, food is here generally is heavy, and I didn't think the crackling was done well, too hard and too chewy.

4.0,5.0,"The pig out for 2 is probably the best deal and the most worth it if you're only going to get to go once. So I've heard about this place from multiple people and for the past few times I was in DC I didn't get a chance to go, so I was determined to go this time. And as luck would have it, I got to venture here with some friends for a celebratory dinner. Passing on the wisdom of others, I would recommend calling to make a reservation, and if you want the whole roasted pig, you have to call and let them know. We didn't realize that, so we missed out on it, but we settled for trying the other things on the menu instead. If you love pork, this is a great place to go because their flavors and cuts are so on point! So my friend and I shared the pig out for 2, which is an assortment of entrees and side dishes meant to share between 2 people. While it looked pretty small when it came out on the butcher platter, it was actually quite a bit of food. There was a piece of pork calf that was the main entree as well as face bacon, which is a giant cut of bacon apparently, Mac and cheese, roasted bell peppers and caramelized carrots. The pork was super tender and so flavorful. You could taste the char along with the sweetness of the sauce it was in. The bell pepper was super sweet and crispy, and the Mac and cheese was really good and had a nice crust on top of it. We also go to taste the pulled pork which was also really good, but I still liked the pig out for 2 because you got to try more items. Price: this was on the pricier side of things, but that's why I still liked the pig out because it was a reasonable price. It was $55 for the meal, so when you split it, it's reasonable. Other meals averaged around $20 per person. Atmosphere: the atmosphere was really cool and hipster. They have a bar there to chat and grab drinks with friends. The place does fill up pretty quickly so I would either go early or make a reservation. I really enjoyed this place and it was such a great experience!",802,"Washington, DC",The Pig,Cathy P.,"Houston, TX",2022902821,/biz/the-pig-washington-2
4.0,3.0,"So I love pork. Being Filipino and all means that I love to eat pork. I was super pumped when my friend suggested this place on a Sunday night at 9 pm during restaurant week. I was hoping that this would be the perfect way to end the weekend. Of course, there's a menu for restaurant week and we were able to get a three course meal: appetizer, entree, and dessert. I got the tomato heirloom for appetizer and jut was bomb. Two of my friends got the face bacon and it was super fatty. One of my friends couldn't even eat it and her experience for the rest of the night was ruined. We should've known that pork was super fatty but the meal was just 50% fat. I ordered the pork mansala (I believe) and the sauce and rice were on point. It was just so fatty. My wife ordered the gnocchi and was also super disappointed. (We took it home for leftovers and it just wasn't that great.) however, we were also aware that gnocchi is really hard to perfect and The Pig masters in pork, not gnocchi. The dessert was also pretty amazing. There was cheesecake with goat cheese and it was tasty! I had the bread pudding of some sort and that was also tasty.

4.0,1.0,"If I was ever disappointed, this was the time. I had previously marked The Pig for a dinner date with four other young ladies; but after the date was cancelled, The Pig was left to sit on my list for months before I had the opportunity to grace this four start establishment with my presence. It was a random Thursday when I decided it was time to sink my teeth into as much pork as my belly allowed (I'm in love with the Pigg-y!). We walked in to a very awkward space. I didn't immediately see the hostess, so we stood around like a couple of lames waiting for someone to greet and show us to a table. Anytime I have to look at my watch to note the seconds elapsing  is a bad situation. You may note it in my affective expression and in my tone that I am irritated and forming an opinion. After being handed the menu, I felt mildly confused. I had viewed all the photos on yelp, and felt confused when I saw that the menu was not as extensive as I anticipated. For some strange reason, I thought the waiters would walk around with roasting pigs on a cart, where the patron would be able to select a part. Maybe this would have been a better concept than offering small, barely there items that were under seasoned, vinegary and dry. The crackling and goat cheese appetizer was good, but would have been better had the pigs skin not been over fried. For dinner I had the pulled pork, mac & cheese and turnips. Let me preface this by saying I love turnips, turnip greens and bok choy. This was a vinegary mess of a dish and I politely sent it back to the kitchen. Its replacement was so forgettable that I can't remember it it give it a proper mention in this review. The pulled pork was okay, just not as flavorful as I imagined. You know, I don't have the highest standards for pork dishes. Pork has a high fat content, so I expect the meat not only to be tender, but flavorful WITHOUT a ton on seasoning. You don't have to do a whole lot to make a pork dish taste like something. So, the fact that the pulled pork, at an establishment call The Pig, didn't have pulled pork that was amazing is quite disappointing. To this point, my husband, who has the most basic palate in the world (probably not an overstatement) didn't enjoy the food and confused about why I suggested The Pig. smhOur waiter, although very nice, was also negligent. Disappearing for long periods of time and forgetting to refill our drink orders was unacceptable in my opinion. I hope this was purely a fluke night. There are too many rave reviews to validate The Pig. I would likely revisit in hopes of updating my review, but only The Pig switches up the menu a bit. Sigh.",802,"Washington, DC",The Pig,Adrienne M.,"Lorton, VA",2022902821,/biz/the-pig-washington-2
4.0,4.0,"Three and a half stars. A group visit during opening month proved promising, with excellent fare and decent service; my deepest regret here is not returning as quickly as possible to try the ramen or brains before the extensive menu got pared down to a fraction of the offal.A year later, I was dismayed to find their kitchen's output offkilter: crispy ear salad had been overcooked this time, gnocchi were a little gummy, cheek grits were a little bland; BBQ pig tails were fine, but the desserts we tried were just okay-- sticky toffee pudding and white chocolate panna cotta.To break the tie, I found myself charmed back through its doors for Restaurant Week dinner. Ben M. provided attentive service was friendly about answering questions on different dishes.- Unevenly sliced table bread's still room temperature, but the whipped butter keeps it interesting.+ Pork rillettes served as a flavorful amouse bouche.~ Face bacon was rich with crispy edges, had enough hint of maple, and plenty of bourbon molasses mustard to cut the fat lingering on the palate. Good option to share.+ Red wine venison crudo was phenomenal, and beautifully composed with halved grapes and baby grape tomatoes, dots of habanero aioli, crushed hazelnuts, and torn leaves of nepitella, though a few slices stuck together so manual dressing application was necessary. Totally my favorite plate of the night.~ Crispy pork shank was fork-tender, but I wanted more flavor in the collards.- Pork cheeks were executed with heat, in a style that reminded us of jambalaya. Much better job with the grits this time.- Pipe Dreams goat cheesecake served as a basic contrast against the diced peach topping infused with bacon bits. - Watermelon was actually sweeter thanks to the strawberry gelato and caramelized pineapple chunks, though I liked the play of sesame notes against the honey.Future hit list: porcetta, bone marrow, trotter, blood pudding, the chop; suckling pig omelet... and I'll hope for more literal heart on the plate.",802,"Washington, DC",The Pig,Ruth C.,"Washington, DC",2022902821,/biz/the-pig-washington-2
4.0,4.0,"On a recent visit to DC, we headed to The Pig for dinner after another nearby option was closed due to it being a Monday. We were greeted and sat at a table immediately upon arrival. We each selected a beer off of their decently sized beer list. I went with the Porkslap, which I felt was fitting given the fact that we were in a place called The Pig.The server explained that the menu changed frequently based on the fact that they order whole pigs and then use every single part of the pig. The menu is broken up into boards, salads, share plates, and suppers. We kicked our meal off with a share plate--the softshell crab that was served atop fried green tomatoes and accompanied by some type of delicious, green sauce. The crab was done well, and I always enjoy fried green tomatoes.For our ""suppers"", he ordered the burger, and I went with the BBQ dinner, two dishes that I believe are always on the menu. He said the burger was good--he ordered if after missing burgers because he was out of the country for a while. He wasn't raving about it, but I did try some of the face bacon and thought it was really good. My meal was awesome. The pork was tender and the sauce had great flavor. The slaw was unique in that it had mustard seeds and was a refreshing complement to the pork shoulder. The show stopper was the mac & cheese! I am not normally a huge mac & cheese fan, but this might have been some of the best I have ever tasted.All in all, I had a very delicious meal at The Pig. However, I only gave four stars because of the price. The food is awesome, don't get me wrong, but I personally don't like spending close to $30 for barbeque or near $20 for a burger.",802,"Washington, DC",The Pig,Alexandria T.,"Charlottesville, VA",2022902821,/biz/the-pig-washington-2

4.0,5.0,"""Artificial amateurs, aren't all amazingAnalytically, I assault, animate thingsBroken barriers bounded by the bomb beat...""For a VEGAN restaurant, this place is AMAZING.  I mean, what better name to give to a veggie place than The Pig!?!?  Kidding, this place (as the name could present) is all about serving pork and serving it in a way (or multiple ways) that pleases the pallet and the soul.The folks at The Pig are no amateurs --They did not get a James Beard award but they are not in that category (aka the food is not $900 per plate)The MENU: This thing changes on a weekly basis if not more often.  With this, The Pig has a large variety of items including salads, small plates, and of course main entrees.  Again, these change on a weekly basis but there are a few items that are staples (including the Apples with Bacon/Peaches with Bacon --depending on the season and the always popular Face Bacon.)The Ambiance: This is a small place on 14th but has a cool bar in the rear with a few TVs, several booths along the side, and comfortable tables in the middle.  Also (while in season) there are a few tables out front (these are good for people watching on the street but also as I found out last week, good for people watching with other customers (but that is a story for another day).Bathrooms: These are clean and have fun items on the walls--if you go, I highly recommend hitting these up.Whiskey: Can't go anywhere in DC without having some good alcohol and this place hits the mark.  Any yelper (over the age of 21) can walk into this place and get a nice flight of Whiskey on any given night.  Now I am not talking about Jack or other bottom shelf items, I am referring to some pretty good stiff drinks (that also rotate like the menu).Overall:The GOOD: Food (and no offence but if you go to a place called ""THE PIG"" don't get the burger.. it is good (so I hear) but seriously, the place is called the PIG--get some pork!)The BAD/The Ugly: If you try something that you fall in love with, it will not be on the menu again..

4.0,5.0,"My husband and I loved it at The Pig! Great rustic and industrial decor, great food, friendly host and staff. It appears the menu changes daily, our server was explaining to us they order 5 pigs a week and use every bit of it, so when a certain bit is gone, it is gone! The service was great, the restaurant was full when we arrived, so a server converted a six person table into a table for 2 by removing some slats, so we wouldn't have to wait. Firstly we were given a complimentary amuse Bouche of pork crackling with goats cheese and pickle, very nice. I ordered the bbq dinner, which included bbq pork butt, cabbage coleslaw and Mac & cheese. It was delicious! The sauce on the pork was really tasty with a homemade sauce & didn't just taste like bbq sauce from a bottle like some BBQ! My husband had the burger, which was huge, he really liked it and and the burger bun but found the chips a bit crunchy  abs overcooked. We were too full for dessert but they sounded amazing. We were however given some complimentary homemade mint chocolate with was AMAZING! I even asked if they sold the chocolate so I could have more to takeaway! (They don't).

Anyway, we ordered a lot of food, which I posted updated photos too but one of them is the lard donut, which was delicious. Then we had the buttermilk biscuits. Erm. Meh. Godeh. That is by far the best thing I have ever had. If you get any appetizer. Get. That.I also ordered the spiced sausage, bacon, cheese grits and eggs. It was delicious but didn't care for the greens they gave me. They looked wilted and had tiny holes from some insect that prolly ate off of it. Blah. But let's be honest. People don't go to The Pig to eat veggies. So! I will keep them at four stars. Also a side note, don't get their cherry sparkler.

4.0,3.0,"Wasn't planning on stopping by here, but my original destination unexpectedly closed early so I was forced to find another option nearby on 14th St. I had heard about The Pig from a few co-workers, so I decided to give it a try. Brunch runs until 3 PM on weekends but several menu items had sold out by the time we showed up at 2 PM, so make sure to go a little earlier if you want the most options.Service was prompt and friendly but I could foresee some issues if it got busier. It seemed like the few servers working the floor had their hands full at all times and we didn't see our waiter too often. Food arrives quickly.I had the sausage platter which comes with grits, toast, an arugula salad, and bacon. The sausage patty itself was a little on the salty side and too dry, but the grits were absolutely delicious. Loved the bacon too as it was thick cut and crispy. The salad and toast were nice additions to make it feel like a balanced meal. My friend ordered the pork tenderloin and the sauce was divine. It also came with grits. Portion sizes here are decent for the price and we noted a pretty decent cocktails menu as well.

Lightly caramelized apples with crispy bacon. Better than the bacon-wrapped peaches from last season.- BBQ dinner plate. Smoked pork butt, awesome baked mac n cheese in its own little ramekin, and cabbage slaw with horseradish. So good!The Sticky Toffee Pudding and the service is still amazing as well.

4.0,4.0,"No doubt a trendy menu, which changes daily. There are some staples, like face bacon and cracklings which seem to be regulars though. The face bacon is a piece of the jowls that have been cured and cooked. It's think so the meat is thicker than regular bacon, and so is the fat. The cheeks dinner entree and burger were delicious. The cracklings were pretty crispy but there were several pieces with the pig's hair still on them.",802,"Washington, DC",The Pig,Landon C.,"Alexandria, VA",2022902821,/biz/the-pig-washington-2

I got the mac & cheese, which wasn't the best I've ever had, but certainly didn't disappoint. And I wrapped it up with the bone marrow, whose consistency and description really freaked me out and had me worrying I was going to have to order something else....until it melted in my mouth on top of crispy bread in the sweetest, cheesiest, saltiest, most amazing way that left me wanting more than the two (bones?)

4.0,5.0,"If you're traveling from out of town, and you like pork - nay, if you need good food that is both delicious and unpretentious, The Pig is where you'll get your fix.VENUE: Dark and intimate (like most restaurants at dinner) you will have a slightly difficult time reading the menu. Luckily you will be distracted by the good service and great food to notice. When my group came in the place was already pretty packed. We were smart enough to make reservations (factoring in both Valentines and Presidents Day weekend) and were sat instantly. The restrooms are kind of creepy at first as the walls are covered in pig-oriented wallpaper/photos but just wash your hands and get back to your meal.FOOD/DRINK: If you want a cocktail, go for the FARMHOUSE SMASH. Very fresh and sweet. If you want something paired with the pork, choose the SHIRAZ from Australia! SPICY PIG TAILS: Super fatty. The texture is gummy and soft so if you're not into that skip over this. But if you want something new and don't mind a tiny bit of tang in the sauce, go for it.WAGYU TAR TARE: This was a surprising treat. It does not taste like raw meat at all - the saffron ailoi and the shallots blend perfectly for a light appetizer. Very subtle but delicious.PORK SHANK SPECIAL: $25. Worth every penny. Split it with a person if you're a small eater. I split this with my friend and between the two apps and my side, it was more than enough. The pork is cooked so well - tender and juicy with a crispy layer of skin on the outside. The rub on the skin is a little salty but pairs well with the sweetness of the pork.SIDE of MAC&CHEESE: Small portion for the $7.50 you're paying but if you need a more subtle flavor to cut the kick of all the pork then this is the dish for you. The crust has truffle oil. Need I say more?STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING: Yes. Yes. and Yes. Small little toffee pudding that comes with a side of this sweet creamy sauce you can pour over it. Worth the price despite serving size - you will be so full by the time you get it that you'll be happy you only had one bite. Nope I take that back. Make room for it and get your own. We split this dessert as a table of six and I wanted to cough on it just so everyone would be grossed out and I would have an excuse to horde it for myself. SERVICE:  Matched the food.

4.0,3.0,"Yes, I go to BBQ places. Most of them have the best sides (Sweet Auburn BBQ in Atlanta) and some even have fish for me so we like checking them out. I also like to give my hubby an opportunity to eat some pork every once in awhile. This was our first stop on our happy hour tour and we liked it. The decor is sleek and classy. The bar was packed and if a seat was empty then it was almost immediately filled. The rest of the place didn't fill up till 7ish, which makes sense. You want to try the smoked lemonade! It was the perfect amount of smokiness and sweetness. As for food, the Mac and Cheese was ok, but not great. Everyone around us seemed to be there for the burger deal ($10) on the happy hour menu. My hubby had the Korean BBQ and he said it was good. The French fries looked good too. I would try them if I had to go back here.

I don't know how she learned all these adjectives but I've got to learn to use them in reviews.  We ended up ordering the Lard Donut, Face Bacon, Pulled Pork Benedict and Mac & Cheese. Lard Donut - Donut cooked in pig fat covered with maple / honey glaze with crumbled pistachios all over. The glaze / sauce was amazing! The donut was light and fluffy as well. Super good. Face Bacon - Oh my god, this is a MUST try. The bacon just pulls apart easily and is so soft and tender. The sauce is amazing as well! I think it's mustard & maple.  Pulled Pork Benedict - The pulled park was quiet good! I didn't care much for the rest of the benedict thought. The bread was soggy and difficult to cut.Mac & Cheese - I think this was my least favorite out of all the items. There wasn't anything super special about it and the cheese flavor was bland.

The Pork Shank was perfectly cooked. However, it lacked any distinct flavor. The sides that came with the Pork Shank were not memorable. The Mac & Cheese was pretty good.

Oh sorry.  I was day dreaming for a moment.  Yes there is a restaurant called The Pig smack in the middle of downtown DC, and it is worth the walk or taxi ride from wherever you are staying or living there.  If you were walking quickly through the still rough but gentrifying neighborhood near Thomas Circle you might miss this unassuming place but make sure you don't.  It is small with a small bar in the back and very unpretentious.  I recommend reservations as they filled up quickly when we were there.  We did not have them but did not mind the wait as they had some nice beers on offering to whet our whistle as we waited.  Dinner was great.  I opted for the vegetarian dish. Hah! Just seeing if you were paying attention.  Of course we took advantage of the many pork offerings.  The sausage board was a nice selection of grilled sausages and the server took the time to explain what was available and her recommendations.  After that an array of small plates we shared included bone marrow, prosciutto and cured salami.  Truly one of the better restaurants I have come across in a town that is chock full of them.",802,"Washington, DC",The Pig,Curtis H.,"Sparks, NV",2022902821,/biz/the-pig-washington-2

Server was very helpful--knew whole menu very well and made good suggestions, particularly on drinks, which were very tasty! The food was mostly pretty strong. Standouts for me were the pork chop, bacon wrapped peaches with blue cheese, the pork and turtle curry, and the truffle blue cheese. I had a four course tasters menu, which was chef's creation and changed night to night. It was probably the only choice I was disappointed in. I always think of that as an opportunity for the chef to really do some out of the box choices, but the options I had for the most part weren't really exceptional. One was a thinly cut aged slice of pork wrapped around a bite of cantaloupe. One was pork belly with squid ink. The squid ink was interesting, and it didn't taste bad at all. But pork belly? My most unique taste was a kind of pork sushi, which you dipped in a blood sausage type liquid, which was actually outstanding.

The menu is changed based on the availability of ingredients locally sourced within 150 miles. So to our dismay we did not see the crepe brûlée cake. It's ok that will not stop us. Our server was a doll she was quite patient with us and suggested a few items. She knew the food well and it cinched the crispy pork shank for us. We also ordered the sticky toffee pudding and asked for it to come at the same time. She was like ""oh that's new. A little savory and sweet."" Clearly we are weird. Well she brought us our bread with our order of the pork revenge (a rum with apple cider). Boy oh boy, was that the best revenge ever! It was like an alcoholic Apple pie. I could have another one of those any day especially a cold one like today. The bread was lovely with the housemade butter!The food came and wow. It didn't look like much but we were both stuffed. The pork shank delivered on its crispiness and tenderness (fell right off the bone). The cider infused sauce added great balance. The sticky toffee pudding could have used another texture component and more sticky toffee but the bourbon milk was a great addition to soak up and drink!The meal total came out to be ~$50 which is pretty pricey but heck it was well earned today and a pleasant treat to end our day in DC.",802,"Washington, DC",The Pig,Carolen M.,"Milpitas, CA",2022902821,/biz/the-pig-washington-2

4.0,2.0,"Wow. Ok so let me say up front that everything about this restaurant was good except the food.  Here's the short version of Restaurant Week at The Pig: A TON OF BACON FAT mixed with everything, deep fried,-and that's about it.  The Pig took this week to unload a battleship of old pork lard they'd been saving for a few years, and call it food.  Very little came out as we expected. Order something that sounds good, get a mass of deep fried bacon lard. Four of us ordered the restaurant week menu and two of us were throwing up later that night.  It was just really awful food, and we felt deceived by a menu that was big on words but light on actual description.Goat cheese cake with no sugar.  Go figure.  Overall the food sucked but the people were nice, and great service.",802,"Washington, DC",The Pig,jon C.,"Atlanta, GA",2022902821,/biz/the-pig-washington-2
4.0,4.0,"Two words. Face Bacon. If you hail to all things pork, then this is your jam. (They even have bacon, jam). Went for a late dinner with some coworkers as we were staying in DC for business that week. We walked from our hotel to Pig. What a warm and cozy place. Reminds you of being somewhere in Texas. From the décor to the menu options. I had a bunless burger which was pretty tasty. We started with the sausage platter which was fun to try/share. And also a plate of face bacon which was scrumptious. I really liked my burger, my dining partners weren't very crazy about their entrees said they were a little bland but I can't vouch for them! Mine was good! The server was very accomindating to my gluten allergy, and even brought out me my own appetizer (when everyone else got a bread pudding). They bring this to you when you order for free. Take that bread basket! So good. Granted it was like a cherry tomato stuffed with something but it was still good.  I'd definitely go again if I was in the area. #praisethelard",802,"Washington, DC",The Pig,Victoria S.,"Annapolis, MD",2022902821,/biz/the-pig-washington-2

They have rotating flights of bourbon available on a regular basis. We tried the ham and honey butter biscuits, which were not the best item that we tried, but the butter was definitely tasty. I particularly enjoyed the truffle mac and cheese, and my burger. I have to say, the burger was absolutely excellent.

Ok - egg's benedict, which the waiter was very eager to push.2. Their menu is only ""representative"" of what they might serve.I had made the reservation because they listed a breakfast poutine on the menu, something I was eager to try. When I asked for the item, the response I got from the server was: ""Oh, you shouldn't rely on online menus with us. Our menu changes way too often."" and walked away. No apologies, no we'll rectify this, no I'll check to see if we can arrange something, nope. Just ""tough sh|t dude"".3. The $22 platter (little pig) is way overpriced.

4.0,4.0,"As you all probably know, I'm an avid diner and this place has been on my bucket list for a minute. So when me and one of my good good girlfriends were planning our biweekly dinner, we decided on The Pig!!There was a bit of a wait, but we were welcomed to sit at the bar. Of course there was standing room only, but as a former bar tender, I was on the watch for patrons who appeared to be winding down the night. I must say that the bar was full of squatters (slow sippers, chatters, and gawkers) but that's what bars are for, right? I don't know how these people sit for so long on those metal butt pain inducing bar stools. After about 20 minutes, we spotted two seats at the L shaped end of the bar and I squeezed right in, she followed with the beverages. I decided to go non-alcoholic that night and ordered the ginger beer; and the bar tender seemed to be pleased with my choice since he iced my glass, poured my GB and proceeded to help himself to my leftovers in the bottle!.... I was not too pleased especially since this beverage does not come with free refills and there was no alcohol involved to soften the blow! But anyways the GB was good, not too sweet and just enough spice. I don't remember what my fellow diner ordered. After about an hour, we were seated in a lovely booth ( I was praying we wouldn't be seated at a table since they are mostly stationed near the breezy entryway. We started with bacon apples which were a delicious combination of sweet apples, salty bacon, and smoked  bleu cheese, wrapped in bacon and topped with pistachios! I ordered the wild boar pappardelle which was reminiscent of a fancy hamburger helper lol. For our entrees, we shared an order of the pulled pork, truffle mac n cheese, and roasted potatoes, all was very tasty! My favorite were the roasted potatoes as they had a crispy salty exterior and creamy interior. We also shared the pork shank with mashed potatoes, while it was tasty; we chose very heavy dishes and the mashed potatoes were very watery lol.

Ugh my complaint, the service was just horrendous.

I'm serious, you best prepare yourself for a night of booze and intense artery clogging.My date and I decided on the face bacon (absolutely amazing), trotters ($6 and it was as big as my face), the bbq pulled pork, and their pork shank. We were given an amusé bouche to start. Fancy right? A little pretentious but it was delicious. A cute pickled pepper stuffed with pork I believe. It was so well balanced, great first impression. The face bacon is a must-try. Caramelized gelatinous goodness. The trotters were in this amazing sweet chili sauce. Honestly, you could pick at it for days, it was so big. The entrees, on the other hand, were a bit lackluster. The pulled pork was alright and my pork shank ... wasn't a pork shank? It really looked and tasted like a  trotter. It was just way too fatty, I couldn't finish it. The sides were all good though. They all balance well with the pork.I dig the bartenders here since they're very accommodating and helpful.

Their mimosas are heavy on the bubbly (so, perfect), but their cocktails are where it's at. Try the Old Fashioned selection, they are created by the bartenders! It's great to have some local creativity! The Forager was my favorite...a nice take on the traditional old fashioned with a hint of pine and clove. I also had the groundskeeper Willie, which would be a great option for those partial to Gin cocktails as it was lemony and delicious. For actual food I had their brunch frittata with arugula.

I started early on the slipper slope: the day after we got 8 inches of snow, I felt like having a hot, alcoholic beverage a la Porkey's Revenge (apple infused rum + apple cider) but for some reason they didn't have it. Our server just said it wasn't available. Fine, so we got mimosas. But mimosas are cold. I was already cold. I'm a California girl. I don't like to be cold. The only thing that really jumped out at me was the pulled pork benedict, which the better half was getting so I get the mac & cheese with truffled crust and cheese grits. The grits were okay, kind of bland and not enough cheese, The mac and cheese had plenty of cheese but no truffle flavor at all. So thus far: no alcohol, no cheese, and no truffle. Oh, the humanity.

They were served with the standard paper placemat explaining each pour.  For our meals we chose to order a lot of small plates and share.  We got the mac and cheese, the Brussels sprouts, the meatballs, the face bacon, sweet potatoes, and the gnocchi - for almost all of them we got 2 per item which was fine for our group of 5.  Everything with the exception of the sweet potatoes and face bacon were delicious.  I couldn't even cut into the potatoes with the sharp meat knife.  I did tell the waiter so the manager came to apologize AND they did the right thing and took it off the bill.  Classy way to handle the situation and we very much appreciated them taking this action.  The face bacon was just to fatty and not that tasty for me.  I know people have raved about it but it just wasn't my thing.  My favorite was probably the gnocchi.Overall, a good dining experience.",802,"Washington, DC",The Pig,Dipesh P.,"Washington, DC",2022902821,/biz/the-pig-washington-2

(Not the radish).- Blood sausage.  Dry! But tasted good.  Came with poached apples and crispy shallots.  The apple tasting sauce was wonderful when combined with the crumbly sausage.  But have to say, seems odd the sausage was so dry that it would crumble when cut into.- gnocchi with venison ragu.  Really good.  The gnocchi was soooo light and the ragu sauce clung to these potato-y cushions.Nice people.  The server checked on my a half dozen times and recommended some really good food.",802,"Washington, DC",The Pig,Kelly M.,"Honolulu, HI",2022902821,/biz/the-pig-washington-2
4.0,3.0,"Wow I think that we might have either caught The Pig on an off night, or rode the hype train a little too far. When a place specializes in whole animal, I have this expectation that they're going to be pushing out dishes that are unstoppable. While the Pig was a decent place, with a friendly staff, MY personal expectations on the food fell a little short. The atmosphere is a casual, rustic, southern(y) feel to it. I like the lay out. My wife and I had Thrusday reservations for 5:30 (they called to confirm our attendance) but we actually got off of work a little early so we decided to take advantage of some of the happy hour specials.  The happy hour specials have some trimmed down entrees, as well as some exclusives (the ham and biscuit), and apparently the adult beverage specials are only available at the bar as well. Since we were at the bar we decided to try a variety of the appetizers (or small plates) rather than digging in to an entree. This might have been our mistake (or maybe it wasn't).We started off with the happy hour exclusive biscuits and bacon. What comes are three nublets that exquate to about the size of a full biscuit, with a few pieces of fried bacon/pork, and pork butter. I thought it was a decent tasting appetizer. Something that doesnt sit too heavy for the rest of your  meal, while still getting that pork inspired salty taste. My wife didn't like it as much as I did (a theme for the night). The second taste was the apples wrapped in bacon. Three wedges of green granny smith apples, wrapped in medium well done bacon. The salty and sweet work well together. I like my bacon medium (and not crispy) but I think this once would have been an opportunity for a more well done bacon to contribute to the flavor and texture. After this, we tried the face bacon ( at the recommendation of the bar tendress). One slice of thick fatty bacon. A little less flavorful than a pork belly, but along the same lines. My wife (not a fan of fatty pieces) excused herself after the first bite. After those three small plates we were pretty sure we wanted to move on to something bigger. Some of the large plates. My wife wanted to move away from the swin and in to the beef realm so she decided to go with the burger (80% beef, 20% pork mix IIRC), and I wanted to try a sampler. The Little Pig sounded like an opportunity to try a variety of things so I went with that.  The wife's hamburger was pretty good. It was well done so the outside had a nice flame char and came with a decent bun and a nice aoili. The Little Pig came out the biggest disappontment of the night.  A carving board. Half of the board had pickles, pickled onion, and pickled peppers and two pieces of bread. The other half had a homemade ham, a spicier salamish deli cut meat, and a pulled pork / pate kind of thing. I'll be honest, it was pretty underwhelming, maybe my expectations were too high, or maybe it was an offnight. The home made ham was... less than impressive, the pate was ... not good. At least at that point, having had a number of bacons, and various porks the last few bites of the pate left me feeling ... over saturated.",802,"Washington, DC",The Pig,Chris S.,"Washington, DC",2022902821,/biz/the-pig-washington-2
4.0,5.0,"I have the good fortune of working mere blocks from what I consider to be one of the more solid restaurants in D.C., yet I'm realizing I've yet to pay it respects with a review. Thanks, reminders at check-in! So Fridays, a coworker and I have lately been making a habit of The Pig's lunch, which has become a highlight we both anticipate eagerly each week. Both the lunch and the bourbon happy hour (which, by the way, is a generous 4-7) offer some of the best meals in the city when it comes to quality per dollar paid. Let's start, and end, with the burger, both because it's my standby here, and because the chefs just changed the recipe yesterday, so it's perhaps the one modicum of differentiation I can provide from the other 600+ reviews. I've been eating this burger since The Pig opened, and it's always delicious. It's also one of the best burgers in the city, and that's not a compliment I give it lightly. The bun is solid enough not to melt away with the juices from the burger, yet not so substantial it becomes overwhelming. Pickled onions add a crisp crunch and a nice punch of acidity, with the added bonus of having milder after-burps than raw. And then there's the meat. Although really I should say, there are the meats, because the juicy burger itself (and I really can't help you if you order it cooked beyond medium - that's on you) is out of this world. Or was, until yesterday, when the recipe was changed to 80% beef, 20% pork. Kyle, another fixture at The Pig*, explained that the quality of pork coming to the restaurant had been so high lately that the chef felt obliged to use it as often and as pervasively as possible. The result is a rich meatiness that could sway even the crunchiest vegan. What elevates this burger to intergalactic levels is that on top of all of the aforementioned deliciousness, the burger gets a succulent layer of face bacon, which adds both crispness and complexity of flavor to the whole experience. In case you're still hungry, or merely curious, face bacon is available à la carte as well. Do it now, thank me later. * Kyle, a longtime bartender at The Pig, is moving to sister establishment Logan Tavern.

4.0,4.0,"I promise vegetarians can get a good meal here.While having a very poorly made old fashioned at Black Whiskey, my boyfriend suggested we head to the pig for another drink. The bar was less crowded, more intimate, and the drink was pretty good. While hanging out we looked over the dinner menu. Veg options! Starters and entrees! We came back a few nights later with a friend, a Monday night, and it was full. Our waiter was a bit of an oddball, and there were THREE birthdays that evening, but we still enjoyed ourselves. Largely due in part to the general spaciousness of the place. No over-crowded tables and the bar is back enough that no one is standing over you while you eat.The special - the pigs feet, were fatty and gummy and my boyfriend made a gross mess of 'em. I, on the other hand, did not make a mess of the beets. The two omnivores liked their respective salads and main courses, and I liked my vegetarian options.

4.0,5.0,"Alright, this place is as good as it gets. Great service, great food, and great drinks. It's pricey enough to prevent me from coming frequently but it's not exorbitant. To me, it's a perfect place for a casual special occasion like a birthday dinner with a small group of friends. The menu turns over regularly but there are a few permanent dishes like the face bacon that you can always look forward to. Regardless of the changes, everything they put on their menu is bound to be delicious. Right now, they have some amazing fried sweatbreads (not pig, I know) on the menu that are to die for. Another great dish is the ""pork sirloin,"" which is prepared like a ""pork steak."" It's truly a one of a kind and my description won't do it justice--go try it for yourself!All of the above dishes are from the ""small plates"" side of their menu but they also have full-blown entrees as well. I generally don't like a small plates format but they give you more than enough food per plate to make it worth it at the Pig. It's the best way to try as much off their menu as possible. Their cocktails are also delicious. For the longest time, they did a bourbon cocktail with bacon in it that was to die for. It's sadly not on their menu right now but their wintery spin on a Manhattan was just as good tonight. Finally, the service is always flawless.

4.0,5.0,"Wowza!!  Delicious Pork dishes...umm...please and thank you very much!!  I don't know what to say, other than delish.  Pork being my favorite meat (well, other than fish) I take every opportunity I can to consume sausage or any other pork dishes (especially North Carolina pulled pork, because we all know NC's is the only way). This being our first visit, I squirmed with anticipation as I read all of the available menus (Restaurant week, dinner and happy hour) several days before we even arrived.  My husband and I visited on a Saturday around 4:30, thinking it would be a prime time to grab two seats at the bar and enjoy happy hour before dinner service started at 5pm.  We were a a little surprised to see all of the seats taken at the bar, but we just edged our way up to the counter, and as we were going to just order a drink to enjoy while we waited, a couple paid and got up. (SCORE).The two seats were perfectly nestled in the corner, allowing us ample chat and date time while we enjoyed out wine (and whiskey flight).  Here are all the great things to inform you about The Pig.VERY friendly staff.  We sat at the bar and though none of them were outgoingly (yes I just made that word up) friendly or chatty, they were very professional in their interactions and greetings.  Each of them welcomed us and made sure we always had a drink, water and/or food.  Since we were super hungry and ravenously anticipating dinner, we placed our pre-order with the bartender so that our meal can be put in right when the dinner service started.  In the meantime, I ordered one of the pork spring rolls from the bar menu.  Said spring roll came sliced into two triangular pieces with a side of sweet, spicy dipping sauce.  That little spring roll was just wonderful and a perfect portion for us to not stuff ourselves.  They have happy hour everyday, which is hard to find in DC, but very welcomed.I enjoyed only one glass of red wine (to my surprise and joy they were offering rioja and tempranillo as their happy hour wines..it's like they knew I was visiting and those were my favorite wines).  The husband enjoyed a glass of bubbly and the whiskey flight.  The wines were 5 or 6 dollars each, and the whiskey flight was 8, which included 4 different types of whiskey, each quite different from one another.  The food was just cooked perfectly.  My dinner consisted of the calamari and fennel sausage dish (which was great) and the brussels sprouts with cranberries and goat cheese (which was the most amazing thing between both of our dinners, seriously, order that!)  If I could give one critique, it would be that the goat cheese was almost absent from the dish, there was only a tiny little dab of it, but STILL, even without that, they were cooked beautifully and exploded with flavor.  The husband enjoyed the hickory smoked bbq platter with mac and cheese and slaw.  The bbq was cooked perfectly, moist, falling apart, as it should be. The flavor was more of a ketchup/tomato base, instead of vinegar or mustard, but twas still mouth watering delicious.  His mac and cheese had a wonderfully crisp top, as it was baked in a ramekin, giving the dish complexity in textures (gooey and cheesy within, and crispy on top)...a perfect combo.  The slaw had such a different taste that I am used to, but honestly it was a very surprising and inviting flavor.  I would love the recipe for the slaw, I think I actually prefer it over the traditional southern style. All in all, it was great.  The bar was fairly small, and there seemed to be many people wanting to enjoy sitting there, but luckily there was a good timing in the turnover.  People had a few drinks, ate and left..or they had a drink and a snack as they waited on a dinner table.  We personally enjoyed eating dinner at the bar, but we are bar people after all.  I would highly recommend checking this place out.  It is very simple on the inside, not flashy, but not divey.  Just a modern, cute take on an urban butcher/restaurant.  mmm...pork",802,"Washington, DC",The Pig,Brandy H.,"Washington, DC",2022902821,/biz/the-pig-washington-2

4.0,5.0,"Went with a few friends on a Monday night. For five people, we ordered the hickory bow and four shared dishes: the gnocchi , face bacon, meatballs, and swim and wallow (may be remembering this one incorrectly). The gnocchi was definitely my favorite - light, creamy, pillowy. Meatballs with polenta were good but nothing to write home about. Face bacon was quite fatty but did melt in your mouth. The swim and wallow was tenderloin and scallops - quite a good bite. The bill wound up being only $18 for each of us and we were all happy and full. It would be a nice date place too. I would come back if I didn't abhor driving in dc so much. The environment and decor features a lot of wood and old-time posters of 50 cent wine. Why can't prices stay the same? Parking was not too bad. My friend found a spot right in front of the restaurant around 8pm.

TJ, our waiter/bartender, was phenomenal-would definitely go back to see him too. He was attentive and real easy to talk to! Thank you TJ! Food wise- oh my goodness. Where to start? We received a complimentary stuffed pepper of goodness- couldn't even tell you what it was in it other than pork (of course!). So good. We tried the face bacon for an appetizer, omg pure goodness. For meals, we had the Heritage Duo (pork tenderloin and sausage) and Grilled Pork Chop. Both were awesome and complemented with the perfect side dishes. I absolutely loved the orange hints and flavoring of the duo! Finally for dessert- we tried the doughnut...OMG! The doughnut was absolutely heavenly- to the point of licking the bowl! TJ was kind enough to send me home with the drizzle that went on top of the doughnut! Amazing! If you are in DC and want a good spot, don't pass this place up. The ambience was cute and cozy, full of pictures of pigs (in the bathroom)!! Can't wait to go back. Will need to hit up brunch too!

4.0,5.0,"Holy cow (and pig)! What a burger!I was staying in a hotel nearby and I didn't want to go anywhere far to get my dinner, so I went to The Pig and tried it out. Originally I was going to get something to go since I was going to get up early the next day, but there was a spot at the bar with a great beer menu so I sat down instead.I scanned through the dinner menu and I pretty much liked everything. However, I wasn't going to stomach a pig (or half a pig) the night before a 10-mile race so I ordered ""The Burger."" Based on my profile pic you know I am a sucker for the word ""The."" The chef gave every table a sample prior to the meal (stuffed pepper with pork on balsamic vinaigrette) which was a great small dish to get you started for the real meal.The Burger -- 80% beef,  20% pork; face bacon, habanero mayo, gouda, red onion, fries... all for $18. I ordered a medium (I should have ordered a medium rare but I wasn't sure.) The burger was tasty and well-balance with sweetness (habanero mayo), smokiness/fattiness (face bacon) and juiciness (patty). The face bacon was *out of this world* and there was so much going on in one bite. The portion was very generous but they used a brioche so it could be a little messy, especially if you cut the burger in halves. The fries were well-cooked and the dipping sauce was tasty as well.The burger paired well with the brown ale I ordered (Oliver from Maryland) and everything was perfect. I told the bartender to tell the chef how good the burger was and he went straight to the kitchen to tell him, that showed how much they valued customer's feedback.I looked at other dishes around me and they all looked great!

4.0,5.0,"I eat meat at most once a week and pork is probably last on my list if I have a choice. But with numerous recommendations from my co-residents, I decided to invite my bestie and her boyfriend for a double date. My husband and I were first to arrive and were seated promptly. The ambiance was far from what we expected from their website (dark, chic gastropub), it instead reminded us of Hill Country BBQ (much more laidback - outnumbered by large families with kids). Although my bestie and her bf arrived closed to 45 mins late, our server was more than patient with us and allowed us to wait for our guests before ordering. Among the 4 of us, we decided to share 8 small plates (our server recommended 3 plates each but we were stuffed with just 2). Meatballs, ribs, face bacon, wild boar berries, Prochetta, and pig tail soon swamped our table. Meatball - flavorful but not too unique. Loved the squid ink gnudi and wished they offered it as an actual side! Ribs - wasn't a big fan of their barbecue sauce. It tasted like straight ketchup. However the ribs were juicy and well made! Face bacon - beyond amazing and definitely well worth the calories. At first glance, i thought I would just be biting into pure fat, but instead it was quite meaty and light! The maple glaze - genius. I should have ordered 8 of these babies. $5 each? What a steal! Wild boar - the boar was tender but could use more seasoning. The red wine sauce was underwhelming and berries didn't contribute any flavors to this dish. I did however love the cheese grits underneath. Prochetta - my least fav dish, dry and one dimensional flavor (salty). Pig tails - I would have thought they were ribs but instead these were much better! The spicy BBQ sauce had an amazing Asian kick. The Bleu cheese sauce was the perfect condiment. Although we were stuffed - Complimentary house made bread with peanut butter lard was too hard to decline. We must had refilled and devoured at least two baskets. And As if we didn't have enough to eat, we also made sure we didn't skip desserts - peach cobbler and toffee pudding - well worth the indulgence! There were some misses but overall we loved our pig feast! Service was attentive and friendly. Price was beyond fair for its originality and quality.

4.0,3.0,"Was excited to try the pork palace here.  I have recently gotten into eating more pork bc it is so flavorful.Sat down and was greeted by a very nice waiter, full of personality.  Started off with the major, it is like a spicy margarita, tasted excellent! My friend stuck with water.  Looking over the menu, saw that they have kind of a tapas style of eating with many small plates, thy also have about 4 large entrees to choose from.We decided to go with a small plate of ribs to start.  I like the sauce, but was very disappointed in the texture of the ribs, they were too tough.  I like a fall off the bone rib and this was holding on for dear life.For the entrees we got the pork shank and pork chop.  I enjoyed the shank bc it was very tender and came smoothly off the bone.  The pork chop on the other hand was unevenly cooked, luckily we weren't too hungry so we couldn't finish it, but I wouldn't have eaten the burnt part anyway.  The atmosphere is very casual, nothing to write home about.  I felt like I was in a restaurant in Kentucky.Decent place if u like pork, I was expecting  a lot better.  I was impressed with the service and the shank.",802,"Washington, DC",The Pig,Saam T.,"Arlington, VA",2022902821,/biz/the-pig-washington-2

4.0,5.0,"Sweet bloody pig!!! This place is amazing! Don't bring your vegetarian friend though. We found this place once again, thanks to Yelp. It was near our hotel and we were looking for a place near by to grab a quick lunch. Good ting we called first because although they were open (the bar, I guess) they didn't serve food until 5:00PM.  Since our mouths were all watering due to the reviews and pictures we'd already seen on Yelp, we decided to make an early dinner reservation. Boy are we glad we did!We started with the Sausage Board and the Face Bacon... Oh my god... then we shared the pulled pork dish that came with truffle crusted mac n cheese... Oh my god!!! I can't even begin to tell you how perfect all the food was. Just go... I cannot put the explosion of flavor that happens in your mouth into words.The drinks... if you love spicy like my husband and I do... order the Old Major. This might possibly be the best Martini I've ever had. It's made with their house jalapeño infused vodka mixed with something citrusy. You really have to sip it because it's that spicy. My husband had initially ordered a beer and switched it to the Old Major because it was awesome. Our cousin ordered a bloody mary and they were happy to make her one. On the second round the bar tender surprised her with their brunch version which I believe may be called the bloody pig. It's a bloody mary with strips of bacon in it.

4.0,2.0,"My colleagues and I were in DC for our Board meeting last month, on July 18. It was 8 of us & we opted to sit outside. It was about 530 pm. The table was open and it seemed convenient enough. We ordered the Big Pig charcuterie board and most of us had the Chili Margarita, others had beer. Let's start with the food.Food: The charcuterie was mediocre, the cuts didn't look or taste fresh. There were 4 assorted cuts, 3 half pickles, some skimpy dry looking carrots and just a sprinkle of zucchini with sauces. For $42, I don't think the quality was what it could have been. Service: Here's what earned this restaurant only two stars. One other colleague joined us so I went inside to ask if we can bring out another chair. The girl at the podium said no because of some kind of DC code that only permits them to have a total of 8 people sitting outside. Ok fine. It wasn't even that she said no but the way she said it, just rattled off the ""policy"" without offering a solution. It wasn't until I asked what else we could do that she said she could check if they had a table for us inside. At that hour the restaurant was 3/4 empty, but she said she would need to check. So she checked with her manager, Devan, who came over and explained that she did have a table and could move us inside. Great! So I went outside and told the rest of our group. Everyone started to get ready for the move when Devan came back and informed us that ""you can only have the table until 7 because it is reserved for another group at that time."" Basically she let us know we would have to vacate the table in an hour. We had only ordered the charcuterie and some of us were planning to get dinner so we likely needed more than the hour. This might have also been ok if it wasn't for her demeanor. She said this without much tact or even an apology. No sense of customer service whatsoever. It was as if she could care less about the experience we had at her restaurant or the fact that we were being inconvenienced. She was short and not courteous at all in the way she handled the situation. Needless to say, we did not feel welcome so we decided to leave. Having dined at many restaurants all over the U.S. I've come to really value service. I think it is a key component and a determining factor in a customer's experience. So I can't say enough about how much a simple smile and a more tactful/pleasant approach & demeanor would have done to change the outcome of our visit. Devan, if you're reading this, next time this happens remember that while a persons experience at a restaurant is about the food it is GREATLY about the ""experience"" that customer has.

4.0,4.0,"The Pig was a fabulous brunch! We made reservations and were seated immediately. Service was quick and friendly. We started with the biscuits - so yummy! The honey butter was great. The side of ham was a bit on the salty side, but that was my only minor complaint. I got the eggs Benedict with pulled pork. DIVINE. So heavy and filling and delicious - def could have forgone the biscuits (though that would have been a tragedy). The eggs was cooked to perfection, they were generous with the pulled pork, and the American cheese was so yummy (never thought I would say that). You get so much food for the 13$ price. Where I was disappointed was the cocktail - I had the prosecco and strawberry cocktail. It was meh. The strawberries were way too chunky, making the drink hard to sip (I was thinking more of a purée). They have some yummy sounding bloody Mary's - alas, I don't like tomato juice. Bravo Pig!

4.0,4.0,"If I could give this 4.5 stars, I would. The only reason it's not a 5-star review is because it simply wasn't ""spectacular."" The Pig IS a very good restaurant with excellent food and wonderful service. The food was flavorful, well-portioned and beautifully presented.I highly recommend the skillet cornbread with bacon jam and honey butter. As my husband put it, he could eat the butter by itself, and so could I. We also ordered the sausage board, which is PLENTY of meat for two people. The umami mustard is out of this world and really took the meat to another level.We opted to share the 6-course Thai Pig Menu. This was a very solid choice. It was also plenty of food to share (for two), especially when you order a few starters.These aren't the exact menu item names, but I'm doing my best from what I wrote down: a deviled crab egg (we could have eaten a dozen; you're served one), crudite veggies from the restaurant's farm with a tomato-type sauce (this was AMAZING, I'm not doing it any justice), a cold beef salad, beef coconut curry with noodles, pork loin served over rice (very spicy, IMO) and coconut sorbet to finish the meal.I think my only wish is that I had experienced more meat in a purer form. Aside from the sausages, most of the dishes were intricate and flavorful - not a bad thing. Then again, I should probably have just ordered a delicious piece of pork if I wanted pure meat :)The service was excellent. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu. We dined around 11 PM, probably right before the kitchen was closing. We were able to order exactly what we wanted with no rush to finish, and our waitress also asked if we wanted to order more hot food before the kitchen officially closed (about halfway through our meal).Note: This lovely restaurant is literally, as stated, ""nose to tail.""

I had the crispy pork shank and my husband had the Wiener schnitzel. Both were under seasoned. The face bacon was the only dish I really really liked. Everything else was disappointing.

4.0,4.0,"More like 3.5 stars, but I rounded up thanks to the excellent, friendly service.The food here is intended  for sharing .. so portions are slightly smaller than a full entree but can easily satisfy someone who's looking for a good sized meal.The food here for the most part is decent and very unique.  It's not everyday you can enjoy a starter dish of crispy pig ears.  But it's not all about flash - because in the end, it's all about the taste and here were some of my takeaways:Carrot Salad - It was literally a salad with some carrots sprinkled on top.  At least the greens were fresh and the dressing wasn't overpowering.Hamachi - The sashimi style fish was fresh, but the taste was so so.  Again, looked great but I didn't have any major takeaways in terms of flavor.Mac & Cheese - Very good.  The crusted top with the gooey macaroni was divine.Bacon Potato Salad - This was okay.  Not a lot of flavor in the potato or bacon, which was surprising.Porchetta Char Sui - Not bad.  The flavor of this dish was stronger than anything else we had.  The richness of the pork belly was nicely contrasted with the bed of beans.Pork Rib (Full Sized) - This was literally a big slab of meat from one big rib.  I thought the flavor was alright, but it was surprisingly bland given the nature of the dish.  This was one dish where I thought it really needed some additional sauce.  At least the meat was tender.Sticky Toffee Pudding - By far the best part of the meal.  Outstanding dessert where you have a trio of cake, ice cream and this ridiculously tasty spiced burbon cream.  You should eat in that order for maximum effect (take a bit of cake, smother in ice cream and smother in cream = mmmmmm).Someone here mentioned that this place feels like The Pig is trying too hard.  I sort of have to agree in that despite having a host of unique dishes - the taste just doesn't match up to the presentation for the most part.  The nature of this kind of food begs for more flavor/taste - and most of the dishes we tried that night seemed to fall short of the mark.  I would definitely come back in the future just to see if maybe we went on an off night, but at least the dessert was amazing.  I also enjoyed the cider beer, which had the sweetness of apple juice but also packed a decent kick (if you're not careful, since it's easy to chug a lot of these drinks).",802,"Washington, DC",The Pig,Kevin W.,"Manhattan, NY",2022902821,/biz/the-pig-washington-2

It's near the convention center so it's easy enough to get to. The face bacon was ok, I come from a culture that's very pork oriented so I was hoping for crisp salty goodness, but found it rather soggy and one dimensional in flavor.

I had the merlot wine, beet salad (amazing toppings of nuts and sauces!), brussel sprouts (roasted to perfection!), and apple bacon (crispy bacon wrapped around roasted apple slices, topped with pistachio sauce...my favorite!). I really enjoyed the ambiance service was very friendly and helpful. I deducted a star because the prices were a bit higher than I think the food portions (tapas) warrant.

I've tried the mac and cheese and it's good but nothing to rush back for or tell my neighbor about. I had a small plates gnocchi that was really great and the best thing i've had there. The meats are good but again there's nothing for me that stands out that much.I would take a look at the menu maybe before dining. It changes a lot which is good, but then on the flip side, a few times we've thought about going, the menu didn't excite and we found ourselves looking else where.

4.0,4.0,"Had the pleasure of dining at The Pig for Sunday brunch. We were lucky enough to be seated immediately, so that was a giant plus. I have an affinity for all things pork, so it was a treat to be welcomed by Roald Dahl's ""The Pig"" poem as soon as you walk in.I ordered a Rise and Swine gin cocktail, made with fresh grapefruit juice and it was a hard 10. We also started with the Little Pig charcuterie board and it was delicious. The mustard on that board! Holy smokes, what a treat. Definitely a must-have starter. Next, we ordered the Face Bacon and it was the best thing we ordered by far. It's a pork jowl that just melts in your mouth, served with maple and mustard. The highlight and a must! For my entree, I had the Pulled Pork Benedict and it was just okay. Could have used just some salt and pepper. I wouldn't order that again.

4.0,3.0,"I personally thought this place was a little overrated. Here is what I tried:PROS:- THE LITTLE PIG - this is great for sharing. We shared this among 4 people. I thought the salami was soso. I like the ham and prosciutto. This was tad bit small for 4 ppl however it was a great sampler. My favorite sauce was the green sauce. It went really well with the bread/meats. I didn't really like the mustard sauce.The olives were okay. I think there was also dates - those were pretty good. 3.75 STARS/ 5 STARS- Bacon wrapped apple with blue cheese - sweet and delicious. I think this was probably my FAVORITE. 5 STARS/ 5 STARS- Bacon Potato Salad - this was pretty good. It was kind of small. 4 STARS / 5 STARSTHE OKAY- Braised Cheeks - these were alright. Nothing amazing. It wasn't as good as what the other yelp reviewers said. Not enough seasoning/flavor. Dish needs more work. However, the braised cheeks I had didn't sound like the ones the other reviewers had. I asked a few things that were recommended on yelp but The Pig didn't have it. Waiter said their menu changes pretty frequently so what was on yelp - they might not have anymore. So this could be the case for the braised cheeks because it might have been made differently.  2 STARS / 5 STARS.CON:- Ricotta Gnocchi - was ehh.. it left much to be desired. It was kind of bland. I would not get this again. 1 STAR/ 5 STAR- Things are a little overpriced for such small portions.Note:- This place gets really busy at night so remember to make a reservation.",802,"Washington, DC",The Pig,Teresa C.,"New York, NY",2022902821,/biz/the-pig-washington-2
4.0,2.0,"Late Brunch Lunch on Fathers Day:  We chose this place because of a suckling pig special advertised on their website and made the trek from the suburbs. it took 20 minutes of driving around to find parking.  Our table was ready because we had made a reservation beforehand. But after being seated, no one came to greet us for a very long time, until we finally complained to the hostess since several servers were just standing around socializing.  Clearly our waiter didn't want to be there that day...he missed 2 drink orders, didn't explain the Fathers Day special until prompted,  and made numerous other gaffes throughout the meal.  The ""Bacon Bloody Mary's are a creative and spicy way to start the meal but pricey at $11.00. There is no kids menu but a very tasty small order of waffle and scrambled eggs was prepared quickly, on request.  The menu totally celebrates pork, and the most of our dishes were well done and tasty. The signature app is ""face bacon"" and is awesome!  But the mac & cheese was nothing special.  Eggs Benedict with pulled pork were a real hit at our table but a pastrami sandwich was dry and tasteless.  The suckling pig special was a mixed bag - the pork itself was delicious but overloaded with gummy potatao cubes and all laid on a bed of soggy cucumber slices that had absorbed the pork juices.  Curiously one order came out twice as large as a second portion...had they run out of pork by 1:30 PM?.  They did take that 2nd dish off the bill without being prompted.It was an interesting experience but not worth a return visit.",802,"Washington, DC",The Pig,Thad Z.,"Alexandria, VA",2022902821,/biz/the-pig-washington-2

It was so good, I ordered another round!  I do suggest ordering one large dish to split, it could be enough for just two (without ordering anything else).  For being a top restaurant, the prices weren't that bad and the portions were decent sizes.

4.5,4.0,"Do not get my four star review wrong, the food here is great but it is DEFINITELY NOT worth waiting in line for hours. Scratch that, you don't even have to wait in line for a table if you plan it right. My husband and I went on a Wednesday evening around 6:15 and were told a table would be available in 45-1hr. We agreed and headed next door to Molly Malone's for a drink. No sooner than five minutes after leaving Rose's and the exact minute the bartender set down my drink did we get a text from Rose's saying our table was available and we had 15 minutes to respond. I literally chugged my drink and we went back to Rose's only to find the exact table that was empty five minutes ago when we arrived was now our table. I truly think they make you wait just because it is expected and thats not okay with me. I wasted $10 at a bar next door for really no reason. The food menu while small is very delicious. You can read all the other reviews for a detailed rundown of the dishes. The portions are small and I was still hungry after sharing four entrees and dessert. Overall a great restaurant but do not stand in line for their food.

4.5,4.0,"I have to be honest here, I was not thrilled with Rose's Luxury. But I'm torn on how to rank it. It doesn't fit into any neat categories. Let me explain: This might be due to their marketing style, which is based around The Line. Or their over-hyped reputation in national PR ratings of restaurants. In any case, my expectations were very high for coming here on a random Thursday for dinner service. The Line (The World Famous Line around the block) wasn't that long, to be honest. You could easily walk up and get at the end of the line. There were always open tables while we were at the restaurant. And I would suggest that if you really had to eat here, if you come early and sit right away, you will but guaranteed a table--albeit you will have to wait an hour while the kitchen ramps up. That's for a random, not-special-in-any-way weekday.The line is slow moving because everyone needs to learn how the system works. You request a time, they give you a call, if you don't come within 15 minutes you will lose your ""reservation"". If you do come within 15 minutes (we came in about 5), you might still have to wait a few minutes longer which is what happened to us. But it was only 10 more minutes of standing around.We started with drinks. The drinks were poorly described on the drink list and we were not wow'd with what we received. A bourbon drink came with a leaf in it. My wife got a drink that was more like a sweet smoothie.This is probably a weird comment, but I really liked the water. It was nicely filtered. I can't stand it when restaurants skip this easy step. This being a celebratory dinner and big splurge for us, we ordered almost everything on the menu to share and taste. Dishes were prepared well, but the portions weren't all that enticing for the price. They were also a bit bland. For instance, we ordered a curry plate that was probably the best prepared dish of the evening but it just had okay flavor. Dishes like the pork butt were really great and inspired, but it was still just pork butt for $30. The brisket was fatty and unimpressive. The brisket came with some pretty terrible bread as well. The deserts were pretty much not that thrilling either. We tried all of them. I got corn brulee which was okay I guess, but nothing that special to rave over. The foods were pretty well prepared, but at that price point I've had better. Some things were unique (strawberry spaghetti) but not so crazy as to be all that interesting for a second round.And that's the problem with Rose's Lux, it was pretty good, like...high end bistro good. But it wasn't a high end, high class, high service restaurant that I was expecting and am used to. It's barely even in the ""expense account"" range of restaurants that typically market to this price point. The prices were high-ish, but the line thing is a pain in the butt. And so is dedicating my entire evening to some hipster chefs 15 minute warning calls. So it sort of falls into a no-man's land of homecooked-style, interesting, but not incredible dishes. The service is pretty good, not incredible. The restaurant was interestingly decorated, but not high end either...more like a nice house. They appear to do everything themselves, really putting heart and soul into it. I think you can see that in the staff, the kitchen, and the ambiance.It's the love and caring that they clearly infuse into everything at Rose's that makes me want to give them a 5-star rating. But for the price, the marketing, The Line, the bistro quality of food, I just can't do it. Not when the bread sucks. Not when the drinks are boring. But they change it up so much at Roses Lux that I hope a future visit will change my mind and put them into the 5-star territory. They just didn't deserve it on my first dining experience.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Damon B.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,4.0,"I'll preface this review by stating that I came in with a lot of hype surrounding Rose's, and so my opinion might not be the most popular or most glowing one out there.A group of 7 of us planned to head out to Rose's for a celebratory Monday night dinner. One in our party was willing enough to get in line at 4PM to put our names down when they opened. We ended up getting seated around 730PM and were able to sit in the upstairs section by the window.The decor is sort of a shabby chic meets SoHo farmhouse - nothing crazy, but a generally interesting and comfortable place to be. The lighting is a tad dim in the evening, and though there are candelas on the tables, I would prefer a bit more light to better see the food. Staff is extremely friendly and actually provide good banter - this is one of the great strengths of this place. They're very helpful to explain the dishes and are very accommodating if there are certain food allergies or aversions. Do take note that the menu here is relatively short and succinct, so there may not be as wide of a selection for pickier eaters. There are generally about 10-15 smaller plates (think tapas size) and several larger ""family"" options. We ended up just getting just about all the small plates available for our group, and it came out to be a good portion.1. Rock shrimp ceviche - has an Asian-y twist to it with cilantro, peanuts, tomato, and a lime-y dressing2. Summer veg panzanella salad - a variety of small slices of vegetables and bread throughout3. Grilled avocado - has an interesting blend of tomatillo and poblano with cotija blanketing it on top4. Pork Sausage bowl - has lychee, habanero, peanuts, coconut creme, crispy garlic, etc. for a total of 15 ingredients in one bowl ... their most popular dish5. Hangar steak - this has an Asian flavor with eel sauce and scallion garnishes6. Crispy softshell crab - this was probably the most visually interesting plating of the night7. Spaghetti with strawberry sauce - a sweet sauce with a kick, very interesting8. Pesto creste-style pasta - probably my pick of the pastas9. Bucatini with sungold tomato sauce - a bit tart, straightforward pasta... a couple more I can't exactly rememberWe also got a couple of the desserts - the eggplant tarte tatin being the standout for its uniqueness yet familiarity. Almost seemed like a normal fruit tarte tatin.There isn't a fault in any of the dishes at all in the way they are executed. Everything was prepared and cooked very well, and they all tasted great. However, there wasn't anything that was mind-blowing or exceptional that lingered with me. There wasn't any one dish that I just craved and wanted more of, and maybe that's just the difference in my personal approach to food. Rose's calls itself a neighborhood restaurant, but in my opinion, it's fancified straightforward dishes in small plate sizing. The wait times/policy, portion sizing, pricing, and a semi-upscale take on food doesn't quite translate to being an approachable neighborhood establishment for the community to me. It's not necessarily what Rose's is doing wrong, but maybe it's something they're not doing to speak to the ""neighborhood-ness"" they want to embody.In the end, definitely go and try Rose's if you get a chance - you will have an enjoyable meal. But don't go solely for the food - go for the experience, because that's what Rose's really should and will excel at.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Albert L.,"Sterling, VA",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,4.0,"Currently, they didn't have their popcorn soup or the foie gras French toast, but they do have other amazing dishes! The Lychee Habanero salad is a must have and make sure you stir the crap out it to get every layer and texture of flavor. My other favorite was the soft shell crab with the Bloody Mary sauce - this was a perfect savory combination. And for pastas, the bucatini is currently the best one they have and it's just so creamy and cooked to perfection! Between my friend and I, 4 dishes was enough as they also gave us a sample of the strawberry pasta (not as good as bucatini) and the cinnamon French toast ice cream (in lieu of the foie gras French toast). Also, their craft cocktails are as much as 1 dish, so if you're really hungry and want to eat more food, I would suggest not getting one. Their Shinso Tincture is great but not strong while their Of the Moment Gin and Double Barrel cocktail are strong but that's what I call a craft cocktail! Despite the 2.5 hour long wait, Rose's Luxury is quite an experience to try! Was it worth waiting for? Probably not. I think lining up at 4:30 to be seated immediately or towards the beginning is your best bet. Was the food delicious? Yes, but the service and ambiance really puts the luxury in Roses Luxury! My friend and I really loved how attentive the staff was and had a wonderful intimate dinner!",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Eric Joseph D.,"San Francisco, CA",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"All the hype is true and well-deserved.Some of the highlights/other musings:The marigold tomato pasta ... wow. It blew a lot of the high quality pasta in Italy out of the water. The soft shell crab sandwich - pure comfort food. Pork, Habanero, Lychee - I spent a while thinking about the inspiration for this dish. I have yet to figure it out, but somehow it worked, and really well. Steak, Mustard, Eel  - the steak was a perfect medium rare. The mustard was marginally too forward in the dish and diluted the natural flavor of the meat a bit too much.Eggplant tart tatine - interesting, but left me wanting apple tarte tatineWine - excellent. Bourbon and peach cocktail - very good, but too sweet and couldn't taste the bourbon.The service was pleasant, but felt a little bit rushed.The best restaurant I've been to in D.C. yet is either this or Masseria for sure.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Alex P.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"Summary (on a scale of 1 to 5 stars):Food: 5 starsDrinks: 5 starsAtmosphere: 5 starsService: 5 starsPrice: 4 starsIf you haven't heard the spiel about about Rose's Luxury, here's the gist: it was ranked the #1 new 2014 restaurant by Bon Appetit. They don't take reservations. People start lining up at 3pm or earlier. They open at 5pm. They are closed on Sundays.I have been wanting to go, well, since 2014. My friend and I decided to finally go. We picked a Tuesday (hoping for shorter lines than the weekend crowd). We arrived at 3:30pm and were about 10th in line. WOOHOO! We were so excited to know we'd get seated!Oh yeah, I should tell you that I tried going once before, but I arrived around that same 3:30pm time, but on a Saturday. The line was LONG! We stood in line until they opened at 5pm, only to be told that we would not be able to be seated at all that night. Very disappointing. We had a great meal at Cava Mezze next door (that's what you should do if you don't get in). But still, didnt get to try Rose's.So, back to the Tuesday visit. We brought some adult beverages with us to enjoy while waiting for the restaurant to open at 5pm. Then the time came! It was a beautiful evening and there were seats available on the patio. YUP, we sat there. Not only was it nice to sit outside, but also interesting people watching as folks continued to wait in line. haha.Here we go:Food: The food was unique and delicious. You know what one of the most memorable dishes was?? The complementary bread that they bring you. Holy cow, the freshest, most delicious bread I've ever had. it comes as a mini loaf. and let me tell you, the two of us almost ordered a SECOND LOAF because it was just that good. But, we wanted to try as much of the menu as possible so we controlled ourselves...and instead just finished the one loaf. hah.My 3 favorites (other than the bread) were the pork sausage and lychee salad (tons of flavor, so well balanced); the softshell crab with bloody mary vinaigrette (even if you don't think you like softshell crab, get this. You'll like it); and the ice creams for dessert (captain crunch ice cream...it's legit). Drinks: We each wanted wine. Our server was great at giving us recommendations based on the type of wine that we described that we wanted. She let us try a couple. You can't pick wrong-- they're great wines. Atmosphere: Lively, homey, and everything has a reason. Did you ever read that article about how even choosing the soap in the bathroom was a thorough process? They did a great job on everything. It's inviting exciting. Service: Our server was wonderful. In addition to suggesting wines, she also sent us complementary mac & cheese pasta (not on the menu). I think they send every table a free dish, but still, a nice gesture nonetheless. Food came out quick enough but not too fast. We felt well taken care of but not bothered.Price: Pretty typical pricing for a classy DC restaurant, but still a bit pricey. Worth it? ABSOLUTELY. Just not somewhere to go if you're watching your pennies.Before coming here, I always wondered if waiting in the line was REALLY worth it. Like, even me, a huge food lover, knows it's still just food. But you know what? Waiting in line is part of the whole experience. You chat with your friends, maybe with the people around you in line. And enjoy not being at a desk at work, or running around doing errands. It kind of forces you to relax and unwind before sitting down to a great meal.I'd say go on a weekday if you can. And arriving between 3:30-4:00pm was just right for arrival on a week day.Happy eating!",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Rachel M.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"It's not everyday that you have a perfect dining experience.  Rose's made yesterday that day for us.  Everything (the food, decor, ambience, service) was delightful, charming, and provocative.  We were prepared to wait, but were seated immediately at 6:15 on a Wednesday night.  Awesome!  We were blown away by the following: Pork Sausage & Lychee Salad- a perfect balance of contrasting flavors.  Not too anything and definitely not to be missed!  Bean salad w/ goat confit- warm tasting and delightful.  The goat melted in my mouth and the flavors were wonderful. The spicy strawberry spegghetti was delicious and very interesting, but I didn't love it as much as the first two dishes.  The bread they serve is also divine and they sent out the most curious olive oil ice cream. I can't stop thinking about this food and look forward to coming back asap!",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Leslie T.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,3.0,"3.5. Named ""Best New Restaurant of the Year 2014"" by Bon Appetite (as in, best in AMERICA, not just the DMV), I was beyond excited to finally try Rose's Luxury. Sometimes, however, a lot of hype can actually be detrimental...if, for instance, a place doesn't quite live up to the glowing recommendations and you walk in with sky-high expectations. Rose's was not bad by any means, but it also wasn't the memorable, awe-inspiring, life-changing meal that all the hype promised me! At the end of the day, I'm gonna have to be honest and say that to me, while Roses's is cutely decorated with great service and some very innovative plates, it is overrated. I think the biggest issue with the food was consistency - The small plates ranged from amazing to not so great. We tasted:- Bread loaf w/butter: Complimentary warm bread with delicious soft whipped butter that was meant to taste like a potato skin! The soft pat of butter was covered in scallions and a light dusting of potato skin crumbs. I know it's just bread/butter but it was a really good start to the meal! The bread definitely tasted fresh.- Pork habanero lychee salad: Their ""signature dish,"" this was by far my favorite part of dinner. Really robust, interesting combo of flavors, with bits of salty pork sausage and sweet lychee in every bite! Def get this!- Avocado with cotija cheese: This was on the house! Yay for free goodies. However, just not worth it. Nothing special at all. I would not opt to order this for $12 (it is half an avocado).- Hanger steak with Japanese mustard and eel sauce: Well executed but not unique/memorable. Perfectly medium rare and very tender. The sweet eel sauce made an interesting accompaniment. - Soft shell crab with sweet corn: Idk maybe I'm not big on softshell crab but this was just ok...The lightly-battered crab quickly lost its crispiness from the vinagrette that was served with it. Sweet corn underneath was just savory enough, though, and really good.- Penne alla vodka with shrimp: Maybe we were full by this time, but this dish didn't do it for me. The sauce was extremely rich, heavy, and too sweet. We didn't finish this dish (for me, the sign of a really amazing meal is when you want to keep eating even when you're full, just because the flavors are so outstanding).- Corn creme brulee: omg YUM. I loved this dessert. I love creme brulee and I love corn though, so maybe I'm biased. It was not a very sweet dessert...almost savory, but not overwhelming. For an extra bit of sweetness it was served with mascerated blueberries on the side. Had the taste of creamy cornbread.The restaurant is really pretty inside -- I liked the eclectic, hipstery decor, with lots of light wood and strung lights above the tables downstairs. It's a cute spot for a date night. FYI Rose's does not take reservations and is only open for dinner, so if you'd like to make the first seating at 5:30, you should get there early to stand in line (which I'm told can get pretty long on weekends)! If you arrive after 5:30, you can put your name down and they will text you when your table is ready. TIP: There's also a SEPARATE list for the bar seats!! I definitely recommend putting your name down for a bar seat if you're with a small party, as that wait is much shorter usually. We were seated at the bar in 30 minutes (the wait for a table was 1.5 hours). This is a good restaurant but not one worth waiting 3 hours in line for...",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Amber G.,"Arlington, VA",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington

4.5,5.0,"The lady's name was Rose, and she was indeed luxurious. Our favorites were the crispy softshell crab with blood mary vinagrette, the pork sausage, habanero, and lychee salad, and the rock shrimp ceviche with crispy plaintains. While the softshell crab quickly lost its crispiness from the blood mary vinagrette, it was so soft  with enough textural contrast to the polenta and the vinagrette underneath. It was just a dish that was so well harmonized. There were pieces of celery leaf in there that scented the dish and elevated it very well, I think. The pork sausage and lychee salad was amazing. I expected it to be sweet from the lychee but the lychee actually cut through the fatty sausage. It was served with raw red onions and habanero, which also balanced out the sausage with the spicy and crunchy notes. Finally, there are peanuts in the dish with a dressing of coconut milk that gave a nutty balance. Every bite was pleasantly surprising and delightful. The rock shrimp ceviche was served with what tasted like orange/lemon and corn vinagrette. It was so light and a perfect dish to start. The rock shrimp was plump and paired very well with the cilantro. The fried plaintains were like light fritos. We also ordered the special of the day (penne pasta with shrimp served in a ragu of some kind) as well as the smoked brisket. I don't recommend either of these dishes. The pasta dish was nothing special (despite its namesake) and the smoked brisket was SO heavy. If you love eating fat, this is the dish for you (think bone marrow). But I thought it was just heavy without any redeeming features. For dessert, our waitress gave us complementary vanilla ice cream with olive oil and sea salts. This is THE perfect dessert! I hope Rose's Luxury includes this in their dessert offerings. This is one of those eureka dishes that makes so much sense when you taste it. The olive oil was fabulous and must have been very good quality because it rendered vanilla ice cream to be exciting. The sea salt provided that sweet-salty combo that is just amazing. I want a tub of this now!Be warned that Rose's Luxury seems to love cilantro. If you are not a cilantro fan, please speak up. So I know that people debate about the strategy for Rose's Luxury. I am one of those people who HATES waiting in line. I rarely go to any restaurant without a reservation, and I don't remember the last time I waited in line for more than 10 minutes. Nonetheless, it was becoming embarrassing to call myself a foodie without having been to Rose's. My friends and I waited in line from 4:15 (on a Saturday) and was guaranteed seating when the restaurant opened. I would definitely come back for the 45 minute wait to try the 4 dishes I listed above. Finally, our waitress was very insistent that we order 3 dishes per person. When we ordered 4 small dishes and one family dish, she insisted (again) that we need more as the plates come out small. I was initially bothered by how pushy she was being - I think Rose's want a fast turnaround so that diners don't order additional dishes toward the end of their meals. However, the service afterward plenty made up for it. But DON'T BE PRESSURED TO ORDER 3 DISHES PER PERSON. I noticed that several restaurants in Eastern Market recommends 3 per person (Cava and Ambar, for example). We couldn't even finish the 5 dishes that we ordered and we eat like normal women. I would recommend 6 small dishes (if not ordering the brisket).",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Jenny P.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"It is so, so rare to go to a restaurant, wait for an hour and a half for a restaurant to open in the hot summer sun, and to have everything exceed all expectations - I simply cannot stop thinking about the meal, and I cannot wait to go back.I love, love, LOVE Rose's Luxury. I'm obsessed! I would leave my boyfriend if it meant I could eat here everyday with no wait. (I mean - the food is guaranteed happiness every time right? :))We ordered most of the menu to share, and not a single dish disappointed (rare! when did you ever have that happen!):+ the infamous salad made of lychee, habanero, pork and 15 other ingredients - Unbelievable.  The coconut cream coats every bite that is equal parts spicy, savory, sweet and 100% delectable+ the vietnamese pate that is wonderfully whipped, creamy and light. combined with the herbs, the lightly pickled cucumbers and chilis, each bite tastes like banh mi at its core+ the grilled avocado was given as a treat to our table, because they insisted we try it, and we are ever so grateful that they did! the simple dish, piled tall with cotija cheese, poblano peppers, tomatillo, and white onions looks so simple, but it's fresh and beautiful+ the grilled hangar steak with eel sauce and japanese mustard was wonderfully tender, savory and sweet+ the crispy softshell crab was lightly battered, impeccably fried and deliciously meaty. we also enjoyed the slivers of white asparagus on the plate+ the whole wheat reginetti with chili and garlic was awesome. ruffle-edged squares of pasta spiced by chili and dandelion greens. it offers so much flavor in a fairly light dish.+ eggplant tartin is one of the weirdest sounding desserts, but we decided to trust the restaurant after our stellar meal, and you should too. the texture is like apples, but the flavor is uniquely eggplant in the best sense - the dish is so sweet and warm and wonderful. + coconut milk ice cream with burnt coconut (toasted coconut), lime and kiwi tastes like a summer hawaiian vacation, and we all know that is exactly what you need right nowthis had to be one of my most favorite meals ever, and all this for less than $100 total without tip - for the quality and inventiveness you get, that's crazy! and the lines are crazy! you'll feel crazy waiting! but it's worth it. it really is.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Han C.,"New York, NY",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington

I went again this past weekend (this time I stood in line, and there was a 5 hour wait), looking forward to an entirely new menu, and I thought the meal was okay on the verge of bad, even. The only items that stood out were the bread and the complimentary creme brulee corn dessert (which they forgot to serve us but put on the receipt, so I had to awkwardly ask for it...not my finest moment). I thought the strawberry pasta was rather gross. It was basically pasta in strawberry jam, with ricotta cheese. Not really my thing.The grilled avocado, which was recommended to us by our waitress, was as described...a grilled avocado (with some cheese sprinkled on top). Not worth 12 dollars.Otherwise, I honestly can't remember the other dishes...needless to say, I won't be raving about Rose's anymore. :-(",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Nisht G.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington

It probably depends on which dishes you get but I think 2 per small/normal appetite is good for the table if you want room for dessert. Bump it up to three if you have a hefty appetite or don't want sweets. We went on a Saturday night, got in line at 4, probably about 60 people ahead of us.

4.5,5.0,"When visiting DC one Saturday this summer we decided to go to Rose's. Figured it was best to be cautious so we got in line around 5:15pm (People start lining up around 4:30pm). We were the last couple to be guaranteed seating. So get there early and be prepared to wait. I hate waiting so why a 5 star review- because the food and hospitality was so great. We actually ended up eating around 8:40 at the bar. Our table became ready close to 9:30 that night. We thoroughly enjoyed the semi-quiet bar experience and am glad we ate there instead of the crowded restaurant. Anyways on to the food. We got pretty much the whole menu. Three months later I can still tell you the Brisket plate and Lychee salad were the best. I could have eaten five orders of the Lychee salad. I believe the menu rotates so I won't go into detail on the dishes I thought were just okay but don't miss out on the two I listed. We ordered about 7-8 dishes but keep in mind we're not from DC, might not be back for a long time and had waited almost 4 hours to eat. If there would be one complaint it is that they get a better method for reservations. Or pack more people in there. I've seen tinier NY spaces accommodate more people. Maybe they do it to build up hype...They also have a really cool private room on the second floor if you're looking to host a special event.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Laksen R.,"New York, NY",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"Anniversary dinner! So since my brother is a frequent diner here, and said it was one of his faves, I thought I'd give it a try!  My fiancé and I got there around 7pm on a Tuesday evening and yay no line! Butttt you go check in with the hostess and there's a two hour wait... :/ we decided that we would stay and just walk around to kill time. We also requested to sit by the kitchen counter (my brother highly suggested to do so) so we knew we had to wait a little longer.  They have a system where they text you if your table is ready, which is great!  We ended up walking around and then went upstairs to the bar to grab some drinks while we waited the rest of the time. Two hours rolled by and the hostess came upstairs and offered us a private seating near the garden bar but as we were just about to agree, two spots opened up by the kitchen counter. Score!We finally sat down and were greeted by our waiter (I totally forgot her name) who was so kind and attentive!  We got our drink order in and then she brought over some potato bread with some fresh whipped butter topped with potato skins and chives. Yum!!  The menu isn't large at all. We ended up getting the shrimp ceviche, lychee salad, steak, cacio e pepe, and the brisket entree.  My favorite was the lychee salad and the brisket.  The lychee salad had such great flavors when mixed all together, it was something I've never had before!  By the time we got to the brisket (which is a shareable portion), we ended up taking a bite and then boxed it to go- we just had to make room for dessert!  For dessert we ordered the corn creme brûlée accompanied by pickled blueberries.  So good!  Check came along with housemade fig newtons which were good too. All in all this place was very good-From the cute atmosphere, the very friendly and attentive staff and the food.

4.5,4.0,"I was pleasantly delighted at the unique New-American cuisine served here after waiting over an hour in line! Twas worth waiting for! Since they don't take reservations until the restaurant opens at 5pm from Monday-Thursdays, we decided to suffer in line on a Thursday at 3:30pm just to ensure we'd have a spot for my friend's thirtieth birthday.As we entered, the atmosphere felt like any other typical restaurant, but as we walked past the kitchen and ended up in the back where the high ceilings with globe string lights and ivy hung from above, we found ourselves seated in a corner that felt just like the outdoors! Everything had a rustic feel to it! Sit in the back or in front of the kitchen to watch the chefs hard at work! On to the cuisine. Dish by dish. The charred asparagus! My favorite. Mixed with pineapple aioli, fired jalapenos and chive oil, the flavor was on point! I thought they grilled the asparagus to make the perfect crunch and with the jalapenos providing just the right amount of spiciness balancing out the sweet pineapples, it rightfully deserves to be called New-American. Grilled avocado. Do you like cheese? Because the grilled avocado with tomatillo, chili and cotija cheese was simply amazing. A smooth avocado mixture in the center and crumby cotija cheese sprinkled on top made the perfect mix of textures in your mouth. Where to find cotija cheese?!The chicken-fried oysters with tzatziki sauce. At $3 each , each fried oyster was pricy, but presented so nicely on a bed of sea salt, I was afraid to touch it. But, it was yummy! On the day we went though, they didn't have any raw oysters, so I was sad for a moment.Now for their infamous pork sausage, and lychee salad! I would argue it's a bit hyped up. Seemed like an strange Asian fusion dish that had attempted to combine as many flavors as possible. I would have preferred the lychee salad and coconut foam with the red onions on its own. The pork sausage made it too heavy. BUT, do try it, as this was my friend's favorite dish.  Another Asian fusion dish was their uni scrambled eggs dish, which I liked the least. The eggs ruined or should I say consumed the flavor of the uni. Uni should be eaten alone or with a fresh vegetable. I couldn't appreciate the fusion nor did the uni hollandaise stand out. It was more of a mushy combination that cost me $17. Sorry.And another Asian fusion dish! Only this time, my Vietnamese friend said they should've named it French Pate and not a Vietnamese Pate. That says something. Regardless, I enjoyed the pate with it's creamy fat texture and strong meaty flavor. With the herbs added on top, I actually preferred just the spread without the garlic bread!We tried quite a few dishes, but I'd recommend going with more friends to try an even larger variety of dishes. And warning. Pretend this is a tasting because portions are small. Quite small. Although for your birthday, you'll get to enjoy birthday cake flavored ice cream with candles on top :)",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Connie Y.,"Rockville, MD",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"I thought getting here early was a little before 4:30 (they open at 5pm). Driving by to find parking already gave me anxiety. It was 4:15 and there was about 50+ people in line outside. Thank goodness the other couple we were dining with had already been standing in line (7th in line-yay!). Felt terrible cutting because people were definitely grunting and saying things under their breaths. The first girl in line said she had been standing there since 3pm! At 5 on the dot, they opened their doors and started seating. We were sat in the back near the bar and the pretty lights. Beautiful ambiance with both natural rustic and hard steel industrial decor. The four of us ordered everything on the menu except for the caviar and fried catfish. It was a lot of food! The food came out in a perfect pace and the food runners were so knowledgable about everything they dropped off. The food was great. Nothing life changing but great. Was it worth the wait and hype? Yea, I would say so for my overall experience. Our server was super friendly, funny and charming! She and the other staff definitely added to our dining experience.

4.5,4.0,The food is absolutely excuisite!  I could go on and on. Read other reviews for details about which dishes are great and just how great they are.   This place would get a 5 except I think the restaurant should offer on line or call in reservation options. Queing early and waiting to get added to the seating list is something that one might expect to do at a trendy nightclub not at a dining establishment of this caliber.

4.5,4.0,"Alas, got seats in the well-talked about Rose's Luxury.Friday night, 9PM, put our name on the main floor and was told there was going to be a one to two-hour wait. That room was very loud. Perhaps the seating towards the back would have been better, but we had no choice. Went upstairs to the bar and was told we could be put on the bar seating list by the bartender. Bartender put our name, and 10 people were ahead of us, but a seat opened up in ~30 minutes while we waited around the couches and stools. Stepped into the pretty bathroom, laughter and noise from the lower level flows into bathroom. Fancy meyers mint soap. Felt very zen. Cute frame quote.Likes:Seated at the bar. Ordered Himachi Tacos. Four tiny tacos that tasted like thin potato chips,  but delicious and flavorful filling. Softshell crab and pork blade came out at once. Loved the white asparagus and balsamic vinaigrette with the first softshall crab I had of the season. Very small crab, small portion, $18. Pricy but delicious. Meh:Pork blade was a bit too salty, would have passed on that. Finally, fresh fettuccine with mint came out. Liked the mint blend w/ the pasta, but a bit too sweet. Too much sugar was definitely added for flavor. Finally, english pea cake dessert, again a bit too sweet for me, but very interesting combination of pea shoots, sponge cake, milk cream. If there were less salt and sugar on those dishes, it would have been perfect.Would I be back? I probably will to just to try the brisket, avocado, and lychee salad. Hopefully those won't be too sweet or salty.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Jess C.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"Yeah you gotta' wait in line. For us, we got there 2 hours early. Could have safely shaved it to 90 minutes judging by the line. We stood between 2 people who were getting paid for waiting in line. What a racket.It was worth every second of the wait -- and then some. The cocktail list is pretty creative -- but rather pricey. Good though . . .We ate just about everything on the menu: rock shrimp ceviche with crispy plantains, grilled avocado with tomatillos, poblano, cotija cheese and cilantro; pork sausage, habanero, peanuts and lychee salad; grilled hanger steak, japanese mustard, eel sauce and scallions; crispy softshell crab with sweet corn and bloody mary viniagrette; cicerchie bean salad with confit goat and marinated cherry tomatoes; smoked brisket, white bread, horseradish and slaw; eggplant tarte tatin; coconut ice-cream with burnt coconut and caramel sauce; corn creme brulee. The server was amazed at how much we ate. Yes indeed -- we rolled out of the joint.There wasn't a dud in the bunch. Standouts included the avocado, the sausage/habanero/lychee salad, the bean salad, the brisket was to die for, and the eggplant tarte tatin as well as the corn crème brulee.Trust me -- I will be back. 2 hour wait and all.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Eric W.,"Sterling, VA",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"I had one of the best meals of my life last night.I got in line just after 5:00 and around 5:45 I was on the list for the ""6-seat private bar"" area. My vodka of-the-moment cocktail kept me busy until my date arrived and our table was ready. We sipped on the gin wasabi drink first, followed by a bottle of the cheaper rosé. Both were great, but don't miss the gin cocktail if it's still on the list. Wow.The service was consistent, friendly, fun, and perhaps most importantly, very real. The host had a genuine smile on her face. Our server/bartender gave us some well-meaning grief. The girl working as barback was cracking jokes. I've been to and worked at a lot of restaurants and this is special.The food was even better. We loved spooning out the soft-as-butter grilled avocado. My date adored the pork sausage salad dish. The crispy crab (legs and all!) was my first softshell experience and the vinaigrette made it heavenly. But the spaghetti with spicy strawberry sauce is what I'm going to come back for, before I leave town. I will wait in line alone to get a table by myself and eat that dish before it disappears.If I end up returning with a group, I want to pursue the family style dinner options. They look amazing. We just got too excited about the small plates to get that far.It would be a sin to summarize dessert. We ordered the ice cream trio - coffee/chocolate, a stunning white chocolate/avocado, and the cinnamon toast crunch which evoked magical memories of childhood. The corn creme brulee was another hit. It was so brilliant that it made me wonder why that flavor isn't used in a creme brulee all the time, everywhere. And the pickled blueberries on the side were mild and complemented the dish.This place is ridiculous. Magical. Perfect. There are bobby pins and beautiful soap in the bathroom. I loved reading about it later and hearing that the staff rates the songs that are played (I really enjoyed the playlist).

4.5,3.0,"Okay, I'm going voice the minority opinion. Rose's Luxury is...overrated. I came here with the S.O. for a celebratory dinner. I was really excited to try it, for obvious reasons. We both got off early from work to do the whole wait-in-line thing. We went on a random Monday hoping the wait would be more tolerable. We got there around 4:45 and there was a manageable line. By the time the doors opened, the line was 3 times longer. Luckily we got in during the first seating. Standouts: the lychee salad does hold up to the hype. I could eat bowls on bowls of that stuff. The pate was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and we got extra garlic bread to scrape out every last bite. The free bread and butter was also excellent, but I tried not to have too much in order to save room for the other stuff. Okay: we ordered the whole wheat reginetti with chili, kale, and squash blossoms. The pasta had a butter sauce with the chili only half infused in. There was too much butter for my liking and I found that the kale and squash blossoms were just salty and didn't add too much. The creme brulee for dessert was pretty good (though I couldn't have too much because of my dumb lactose intolerance). Didn't care for: the spaghetti with strawberry sauce was way too sweet. It was like eating spaghetti with jam on top. The soft shell crab itself was good but it could have had more flavor and I didn't think the sauce or asparagus worked very well.Service was great, as to be expected. We also got two drinks but they weren't too memorable, as I can't remember them enough to write a review.I'll clarify that nothing we had was outright bad. I think I was just expecting more dishes to be as good as the lychee salad and pate, and that wasn't the case.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Tiffany H.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington

4.5,5.0,"Holy shit. My life will never be the same. This was one of the best experiences of my life. Rose's Luxury is like a rite of passage for foodies in DC. I had always walked by and thought to myself, ""these people are crazy for standing in line."" Then I did that and it was worth the experience. The staff was really nice and thoughtful. We received a few dishes ""on the house"" because we weren't seated until about 10:30 p.m. We ordered the chicken-fried oysters with raw oyster tzatziki, grilled avocado with tomatillo, poblano, and cotija cheese, the grilled pork blade steak with miso, cabbage and homemade sauerkraut, fresh fettuccini with pea shoots, tarragon and spring onions, and the uni scrambled eggs, crispy potatoes and uni holandaise.OH.

4.5,4.0,"(Insert the hook from Heavy D & The Boys' 1991 hit: Is It Good to You...Indeed, I LIKE IT)You know, I was very skeptical of RL. I'm mean let's face it, how many times have us transplants been fooled by talk of how good the food is in DC?? Too many times have I lowered my expectations, only to realize that lowering them still didn't compensate for bad food. So, suffice it to say, I didn't expect much from Rose's. I would have just been happy that the food was cooked properly, with the expectation of bland food. Well, unlike many restaurants I've been to in the area, Rose's has gotten it right:1. Quality food: everything tasted fresh, as if picked and slaughtered in the back yard. I wasn't surprised at this, many similar restaurants boast farm to table, seasonal ingredients. 2. Comfort food: HAVE MERCY ON ME!!! Yassssssss. Comfort me any day honey! Cornbread, ribs, catfish, chicken fried oysters (if you could see me right now, I'm raising my hand), yes please!! I love everything about food that makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. 3. Salt, in moderation, ain't never hurt no body: can I get an Amen to well seasoned food!! My goodness! What does it cost to season my food?? Apparently $$$, because Rose's can get pricey. Notable dishes: - Chicken fried oysters; don't think about it, just order a bunch!- Grilled pork blade steak. I didn't think it was gonna be good, but I am woman enough to admit I can be wrong sometimes. Order two!! - Pork sausage, habanero and lychee salad. There was a party in my mouth and my brain didn't get an invitation. I couldn't conceptualize it. I still may be in denial. Smh- Mezze Rigatoni ""sausage and peppers."" Quite honestly, this was the best pasta dish I've had in so long, I can't remember what was my favorite before. Everything else pales in comparison. Minus 1 star for the dish that could have been so much better with less fatty portions (brisket). Minus 1 for me for allowing my partner in crime to order the Korean Catfish. I knew it wasn't gonna be good, but I was blinded by my endorphins after eating too much good food. Smh. What you can expect: (since I've used numbers and bullets, I guess I'll start with alphabets)A. Awesome service. We sat at the bar and had great service...at the bar. B. A long wait. Which, our wait wasn't too long since we opted to sit at the bar (45m opposed to 3.5 hrs waiting for a table).C. A relaxed atmosphere. Come in a suit after work, a spring time dress, or flip flops. I don't think you'll be judged...by anyone besides me. Jk jkD. Wear your stretchy pants. I wore a dress and heels, because I knew my pants wouldn't fit after I ate. E.  Horrible parking situation, but it could be worse. I got a ticket that has recently turned into $60. So let's see, 60...150 something...all the sides of awesome and winning will not comp me for that ticket (rolls eyes). So yea, should you make this a date night?? Absolutely! Double date of you like. Girls night? Absolutely! Mother's Day meal? Well, mom may not appreciate how great this place is, stick to your foodie friends or drag out your significant other...have them pay.

4.5,4.0,"My husband and I and a friend dined here recently and really enjoyed. We arrived about 20 minutes before it opened and were seated by 6pm at a table upstairs. The staff really worked with us to accommodate our reservation time since we were waiting on one person to arrive. The decor is very comfortable and homey, but not cheesey. The staff from hostesses to waiters and bartenders were super friendly and nice. We started with craft cocktails which were really yummy and interesting. The menu is small with four sets of small plates and two entrees. The staff strongly encourages you to eat family style which we did. For three of us, we ordered four small plates and one entree and we fully sated. The four small plates were: rock shrimp ceviche, spaghetti with spicy strawberry sauce, crispy softshell crab sandwich, and grilled avocado. The standouts were the pasta and avacado. The avocado was grilled and topped with tomatillo and cotija cheese. Amazing!!! So creamy and yummy!! The pasta was so whimsical but really delicious. The strawberry was present on the front end but not too sweet or cloying and then came a slow burning heat in the back of you mouth. The pasta was topped with fresh ricotta that tempered the spice. Really a very unusual but delicious dish. The ceviche was good, but I thought the shrimp pieces were a little too big and I also prefer a different kind of fish/seafood for ceviche in general. The crab sandwich was tasty, but not my favorite and a little more challenging to share. The entree was the pork shoulder with Mexican street corn (off the cob), guacamole, potato salad, and chipolte gravy. The corn and potato salad were outstanding!! The potato salad was almost a cross of potato salad and cold slaw with cabbage pieces in it--the potatoes were boiled in beer so they were not lacking in flavor. The pork shoulder was good, but a little on the dry side. Overall, this was a really fun dining experience and I would recommend it. We will definitely be back when they have a new menu.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Margaret C.,"Falls Church, VA",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"Carol W and I took my parents who were visiting from out of town to Rose's Luxury for dinner on a Monday night.  It was almost a year to the day since the wife and my first visit there, so we were keenly interested in comparing our experiences.  We arrived around 4:20, well before its 5:30 opening.  Not surprisingly, we weren't the first group in line and the line filled up quickly behind us.Cutting to the chase, Rose's Luxury hasn't let critical acclaim and mass popularity go to its head.  Our experience from food, drink, and service on this particular evening was virtually the same, if not better, across the board as our visit a year prior.  Lauren, our server, was smiling, friendly, and seemed genuinely passionate about her job.  She was very knowledgeable about the food and drink as she went over the menu with us in a manner that displayed actual insight, not rote memorization of a generic spiel.  Our cocktails (Barrel aged Boulevardier and Mezcal Negroni) were well-conceived riffs on classics and delicious.  We also had a bottle of wine during our meal.  Our food (Crispy Oysters; Vietnamese Paté; Grilled Avocado; Pork Sausage, Habanero, & Lychee Salad; Asparagus, Softshell Crab, Fettucini, Family style Smoked Brisket, and a couple of desserts) was freshly made, served at the appropriate temperature, nicely seasoned, possessed layers of flavor, and outstanding!  In fact, the brisket was even better this time around as the smoke notes were a bit more pronounced than what we received on my previous visit.  All told, after taxes and tip, our meal worked out to around $75 per person.  A steal!Rose's Luxury is, without a doubt, in my top 2 or 3 favorite restaurants in DC and in my top 10 places anywhere.  Rose's Luxury continues to offer impeccable food, drink and service at an outstanding value...perhaps the best bang for the buck you'll find in the city.  Come in hungry and with a party of 4-6.  You'll be able to try most, if not all, of the menu and will leave extremely satisfied.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Gregg M.,"Dayton, OH",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"The hype around Rose's is completely legit and you should go now! I have been wanting to go to Rose's since I moved into DC and it was definitely worth the wait, only question I ask myself now is why did it take me so long to go! My friend and I were second to last in line when we walked over at 5:30PM. Knowing we would not be seated until late in the night we decided to stop into some of the other Barrack's Row establishments for Happy Hour. This turned out to be an awesome plan as time flew by before we received a text message letting us know our table was ready. We had the pleasure of sitting at the back bar which I loved. Not only was are bartender/waitress amazing but it was quiet and intimate. We were given the run down on how many small plates vs large plates we should plan on ordering and then ordered drinks. They have a solid wine selection and my craft beer friend was very happy with their beer selection. For the food we ordered such - Rock Shrimp Ceviche w/ Crispy Plantains, Pork Sausage, Habanero, Peanuts & Lychee Salad, Grilled Hanger Steak, Japanese Mustard, Eel Sauce & Scallions, and Bucatini w/ Sungold Tomato Sauce & Parmesan. Without going into too much detail everything was delicious, had incredibly rich, delicate flavors and several times made me just close my eyes and savor the moment. Our waitress could obviously tell how much we were loving our experience so she was kind enough to order us a plate of Buttered Spaghetti w/ Salt + Pepper & Parmesan, this sounds so simple but was absolutely delicious (it's true butter makes everything better). Although we were already on the brink of bursting we decided we HAD to have dessert - Corn Creme Brulee w/ Pickled Blueberries and Ice Cream Sampler (Pistachio / White Chocolate, Chocolate / Cold Brew Coffee, Vanilla / Graham Cracker). I think Rose's deserves the most credit because their food creativity and execution are on point! I am not a big corn fan, especially creamed but now I can't imagine every having normal Creme Brulee. In conclusion, go to Rose's! They are true food artists and I wish the entire staff was my best friend (aka they are awesome).",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Jennifer W.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"Rose's Luxury 100% lives up to the hype as the Best New Restaurant in America. Yes, the no reservations rule is incredibly annoying, but you quickly forget how long you waited in line when you put that first bite of crusty challah with melty sesame butter in your mouth. It was quite literally the best meal of my life to date. As others have stated, the food, ambiance, and service all make for an incredibly whimsical and delightful experience for all of the senses, but especially the taste buds. I won't bother reviewing the food in detail but let me just tell you that we ordered almost everything on the menu and not a single dish rated less than five stars. The grilled pork blade was voted the table favorite but it only beat out the classic lychee and sausage by a slim margin. Also as you can tell from the photos, the plating is gorgeous and definitely part of the whole experience. A few tips:-I arrived at 4:30 on a pleasant Wednesday in mid-March and was 6th in line.-They apparently only have two tables that fit parties of six or greater. When we were let in at 5:30 we had the option of immediate seating but not everyone in my party was able to leave work that early, so we opted for the second seating. Since there are only two tables, the hostesses estimated our table would be ready between 8-9 PM, so we headed upstairs for some lovely drinks at the bar (and snuck in some oysters and lychee/habanero appeteasers). Our table was actually ready at 7:15, which was a very nice surprise.-The full menu is served at the bar upstairs, making it perfect for one or two diners to grab a bite.

4.5,5.0,"Even on a blustery, cold, snowy MONDAY evening, this place commands a long line for the first seating starting 45 minutes before they open.  This is a testament to the quality of the dining experience at Rose's - worth the hassle to understand what all the local (and national) buzz is about!The food changes constantly based on seasonal ingredients but the service is consistently friendly and top-notch without being stuffy.  Come hungry - there's so much to taste!Cocktails:  you must have at least one!  They pack a punch but are refreshing and enjoyable.Bread:  toss aside your no-carbs mindset, the baker here knows what they are doing - both the brioche and Japanese milk loaves were served fresh out of the oven with creative butters.Apps:  Order as many as you can muster - these are all gems.  Veggies:  For a place known for their brisket and other main meats, I've been most amazed by honey-glazed carrots and dill sauce!Meats:  Quail - if they have a roasted quail - it's  a must have.  I had a sweet mustard glazed quail recently - very well charred yet super tender meat.  Nicely done!Seafood: Their fish is often fried - I prefer my fish more true to fish flavor.  Oysters they do very well both raw and fried.  Trout mousse is amazingly delicate and a standout.I've eaten in the outdoor space and also at the chef's counter.  Both were very pleasant with different sorts of eye-candy passing by!  I would recommend the chef's counter if you love watching the machine at work - 10 folks bustling around an open kitchen creating savory smells and beautiful presentations.  If you're lucky and the chef catches you admiring a dish you didn't order - you might get gifted a taste!",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Catherine S.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"There are few dining experiences that change how one thinks about food. Rose's Luxury was one of those experiences for my wife and myself. There is now a new bar by which I'll judge all other fine dining meals---it's Rose's bar to strive toward, for certain. I'm not going to review the meal we had; my words wouldn't do the food justice and I lack the vocabulary for appropriately lauding qualifiers of the five dishes we enjoyed. I do want to mention, however, the simply wonderful service we had at this place. The attention to the diner that everyone on staff---host, bar, wait, bus---had focused around a common principal: intimacy without intrusion. We left feeling that everyone loved their job and, in an unparalleled way, their customers. We felt welcomed liked old friends and family stopping by for sunday supper. I can't imagine how they pulled that off for perfect strangers.-ChrisPS - I know, I know, there is a five to six hour wait on a typical summer night on account of the fact that Rose's doesn't take reservations. Get over it. We didn't wait that long, but I'm not going to share how that was possible as some dining secrets are worth keeping to oneself (we're greedy bastards that want to keep you out of our favorite popular spots---see my review of Il Pizzico in Rockville, for instance).",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Chris M.,"Rockville, MD",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"Just wow...what an incredible experience. Definitely in the top 5 ever. I came here with a group about 5 minutes before they closed - and they had no problem letting us in (no line!). We quickly ordered the entire menu...yup the entire menu.  Let me break it down:1) Grilled Avocado with Tomatillo, poblano and cheese: by far the best avocado I've ever had. Small - it is just one avocado, but it is pretty different. Interesting and glad I tried it but not worth getting again.2) Lychee Salad: OMF'ing-G the most amazing thing I've ever ordered anywhere. Everyone at the table, including carnivorous men, fell head over heels in love with this dish. Order this - it will blow your mind. It's so different from any dish I've ever had before. The pork sausage and habanero gives a lot of depth and substance to the salad.3) Grilled pork steak: eh...I'm not a pork person myself.  Everyone else seemed to like it more, but compared to the first two dishes this was a bit of a letdown.  It is just as it sounds..grilled pork.4) Fresh Fettuccini with pea shoots: This was very interesting, but I only needed a bite. The tarragon and the spring onions make this a very well flavored dish with lots of depth but just didn't sit right with me.5) Spaghetti with spicy strawberry sauce: Wow...so different from any other pasta dish I've ever had or imagined and it blew me away. This is a really inventive but also very delicious dish. Memories of this dish will stick with me for a long time. Yes, strawberry spaghetti sounds crazy but the spicy kick to it keeps it far from dessert territory.6) Korean Fried Catfish: I am not a catfish person and I just loved this dish. Loaded with flavor and so fresh - it didn't even taste fishy to me at all.7) Smoked Brisket: My group had actually just gone out for brisket for lunch, and this blew away the bbq restaurant by far. Moist, hot, and tender. You really can't go wrong with this one.  Desserts...eh. The waiter said we ""had"" to try the eggplant pie and that it tasted more like apple pie.  We had excellent service and the staff was top notch, but they were incorrect here...steer clear of the eggplant pie. The avocado ice cream was quite interesting though and worth having again.Overall an incredible experience with inventive food and staff who goes above and beyond.

4.5,5.0,"Rose's Luxury is simply the platonic ideal of comfort food. Not mac and cheese, this is something else entirely, this place will take root in your nostalgic pleasure center throughout the entire course of the meal, and it is not until you leave that it hits you just how subtle and well-orchestrated everything was.It starts with the event of the queue. Go on a weekday night, if you do not want to wait outside for an hour and a half to get in the first seating before the door opens at 5, just arrive before 7 and put your name on the list. You will probably have to wait at least 2 hours using this method, but you can go have a drink down the block and receive a text when your table is ready. The night I went Jose Andres was also wandering around the block waiting for a table. Everyone (maybe short of the President) has to wait. Once you are in the door an intense calm will settle. There is no pressure to ever get up again if you don't want to. The restaurant is beautiful, it does not feel manufactured or hokey or trendy, it's pretty much just a nice house that happens to have a few bustling line cooks smack in the middle of it. The music is wack pop B sides (this will be my only complaint).Okay, you get your cocktail - I got a tasty agave, jalapeno something or other. It was great. All of the glasses are early 60's antiques that have prints straight out of a Richard Yates novel. This restaurant was named for the chef's grandmother so things a grandmother would own are a theme. The silverware is also notable, not so unlike my grandmother's silverware. Then we got some warm potato bread on a little floral plate. Now it seems obvious in retrospect, but it was not until about 5 hours later that I realized the bread was a play on a a baked potato, the whipped chive butter sprinkled with homemade bacon bits. So that was delicious and over the course of the meal we ate it all.We ordered some plates, trying to order a few at a time so the pace wouldn't be messed up. The server noticed what we were doing and said ""just give it to me all at once and I'll pace it out, what is this a barn?"" I embellish, but even at some of the nicest restaurants they cannot figure out how to bring things out in an appropriate manner.First out was a rock shrimp ceviche w/ crispy plantains. The interplay of the acidity with the sweet corn and plantains was perfect. These plantains were super small fried slivers, that honestly heavily resembled chow mein in texture and flavor. And I do have a soft spot for chow mein given my family's Fall River, Mass. routes (nostalgia center hit number one).Next it was the lychee/sausage/coconut milk salad, which is a huge hit, apparently. I liked it, but as someone that is very familiar with just how awesome coconut fat and red onions are I was not launched into another dimension like some patrons were by this one. Next we got the hanger steak with Japanese mustard, eel sauce, fried some kind of pepper (jalepenos?) and scallions. Mad tasty, especially that mustard. I feel like there was fresh wasabi in there, as well. The dish reminded me of great sushi flavors, but there was no fish or rice. Then the seafood dish - fried soft shell crab w/ bloody mary vinaigrette and sweet corn. Man, this dish. That was a nostalgia center hit as well. They were not being shy with the old bay on this one, and I think that ""vinaigrette"" was likely of the apple cider variety. (only figured this out later).Then we decided we had room yet, time to try a pasta dish for dessert - the Bucatini w/ sungold tomatoes and parmesan. The first thing you will notice about this dish is how sweet it is, but not just in a white sugar way. We ultimately decided after many guesses (licorice root?) that the off-beat sweetness was coming from agave, the same agave in my drink. It was not offensive at all, but worked nicely with the heavy acidity of the dish and mustiness of the cheese.Which brings me to why Rose's is not normal. The menu is so cohesive and thoughtful. There are a handful of crossover flavors to this summer menu - red onion, sweet corn, tomato, agave, cilantro, jalapeno. You do not even notice it is happening because the dishes are so diverse, but it puts you in a trance. And to finish, with the check, a grandmother favorite - homemade fig newtons. With a nice brûlée crust on the top. I will be back the first day the menu changes. Or maybe just eat the other half of the summer menu before then.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Morgan W.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"Believe the hype. But don't let the hype dissuade you from visiting.I wandered down 8th Street SE and found myself in line behind maybe 10-15 people as of about 4:20. I came prepared with my tablet, and passed the time reading. The line grew and more than a few people asked us what we were waiting in line for.The doors opened promptly at 5 and I was seated, solo, in the first wave. They don't fill every table at once, so the tables on either side of me were empty for the first half of the meal.The atmosphere is buzzy, friendly and yet still relaxed. The servers are in good moods, everyone's smiling and it just has a great vibe going on. The decor is all wood, brick, lights and metal and it fits in perfectly.""Hospitality"" really is the buzzword. Your water glass is filled as soon as you sit down and stays filled the entire time. Next you receive a warm, soft loaf of heavenly bread with honey butter. I ate the mini loaf myself and could have easily eaten another.The service is impeccable. Friendly, knowledgeable, chill and just positive in general. I noticed this not just with my server, but with the others too. Even the bartender was talking to the people for whom he was making a cocktail. I ordered a cava and the trout mousse to start. It came out fast, little bites of heaven: the mousse itself, little bits of apple, chervil and roe. I ate each one all together to let the flavors meld.In between the mousse and my second dish, my server sent me a ""gift"" of the famous pork sausage and lychee salad. This, kids, is the real deal. It could soon be as iconic as Rasika's palak chaat. It comes out separate, but a quick mix of the ingredients in the bowl yields a complex, unique blend of onions, coconut ""dressing,"" peanuts, herbs, lychees, sausage and habanero. It's a practice to send solo diners like myself a free dish. It's a great way to encourage more solo dining.After that I had the spaghetti with butter, lemon and duck egg. It looks deceptively simple when it arrives, but it has a very deep flavor and is incredibly rich. I also ordered the beef crudo, slices of meat with sea salt, mustard oil and cress. Another winner; the kick of the salt is what makes it.For dessert, I ordered the coconut ice cream. I don't even like coconut, really, but I loved this: chopped kiwi, coconut milk ice cream, sugar-burnt coconut flakes and coconut milk caramel. It was fantastic. And with the check came two pieces of meringue to end the meal.I will be there again, enthusiastically. It deserves every inch of writing that's been done on it. The meal is not something you're going to get anywhere else in this city. That novelty and the perfection of the service elevate it to something very, very special.

All incredible!The wait staff is well informed and focused on service and guiding you through a food experience. Ask for food suggestions or drink pairing.The Bad: what not to order... Braised pork shoulder with bbq. I wanted this to be good, I hoped that it was going to be good. It was certainly experimental but lack the fall apart tenderness that traditional braised dishes offer.Also, avoid the spaghetti with spicy strawberry sauce. Another once I really wanted to love but really found it lacking delivery.Roses is experimental and there are bound to be non traditional dishes that aren't crowd pleasers. If you go with that in mind you'll have a terrific experience.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Blake H.,"Allston, MA",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"Wow, was the exact statement I made when my friend and I left this establishment. The food was absolutely amazing. Every dish provided your palate with a different experience. My friend and I started out small not knowing how large the plate size would be or what foodie adventure would be in store. We had these adorable bit size tacos with tuna,  the grilled avocado with tomatillo, charred asparagus with pineapple aioli chive oil (my favorite of all the dishes), martielli spaghetti with spicy strawberry sauce and a few other dishes as well.  Additionally, a sweet couple next to us let us try the catfish. It was mouth watering -- crispy, moist, and well seasoned. Next time I return to the restaurant, I will start with that dish first and then probably order a few of the other dishes that are served in smaller portions. To top off the evening we had the ice cream and English tea cake. The English tea cake was tea-reffic -- the cake was moist and the cream sauce had a sour cream like flavor that peaked your flavor palette. The ice cream was also wonderful and comprised of three distinct flavors --cinnamon, coffee, and green tea. My favorite of the three scoops was the cinnamon, however, the avocado was a really close second. The service was good as no one was rushing us to quickly select your next dish or leave. I would allocate about two to three hours for a visit to this establishment. The staff were well versed in the menu and could answer your questions on the particular sauces and seasonings used on each dish. The first 45min to wait in line by about 4:45pm to 5:00pm to get your pick of the restaurants seating and times when it opens at 5:30pm and the other hour to hour and a half to select your menu items and enjoy the food and ambiance. Speaking of ambiance, I would recommend sitting by the kitchen if you do not mind sitting side by side rather than face to face with your diner party. You get to see the food preparation from start to finish, which helps you to decide which dishes to order.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Dawn B.,"San Francisco, CA",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"Rose's Luxury was rated Best New Restaurant in America for 2014, so as you can imagine it is busy.  Also, they do not take reservations.  Oh and they are only open for dinner.  So based on Yelpers, I figured out that I had to be there by about 4:30p and wait in line if I wanted a shot at eating there that night.  We ended up getting there at about 4:20 and there was already a big line and it was like 15 degrees outside. At 5pm sharp they open they door and start letting people in.  They seat the first so many people but the do not fill up all the tables at once, this would overload the kitchen.  We ended up being the 43rd party when we checked in (according to her list) and it sounded like we were one of the last to get a seat for the ""first seating.""  She offered up seats at the bar or said it would be about 2-3 hours for the next table.  We did have to wait about 20-30 minutes at the bar upstairs before they let us sit down, which was fine. We sat at the bar and it was great, it was in the back and there was six people total there and one staff member to help us out.  So the service was great.  For dinner we had a burnt romaine salad (was great), two pastas and the beef brisket.  Most of the stuff is meant to share.  Everything was really good, my favorite was one of the pastas which has some sausage in it, it was in a red sauce and had the perfect amount of smokey flavor to it to make it taste just right on a cold night.  The bill was even cheap.  4 plates of food and three drinks for only like $118 - plus tip.Was well worth the wait, everything was good and you do not pay an arm and a leg for it.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Mike B.,"Loudoun, VA",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"Yes, the wait is long, but it was well worth it. Service is on point here, and so is the food. We had a lovely meal there last night. We ordered a mix of different dishes, and a lovely bottle of white Cotes de Rhone. Rock shrimp Ceviche-delicious. it had a tangy vinegary dressing which was light and fresh. Pork Sausage/Habanero peanut and Lycee Salad - one of my favorite dishes. It tasted like a take on dan dan noodles with the ground pork, spicy sauce and peanuts. I also liked that they offered this dish in a vegetarian version as well with fake sausage as a substitute. Crispy Soft shell Crab with Sweet Corn and a bloody Mary Vinaigrette- lovely, perfectly prepared soft shell crab served with a light and flavorful bloody mary vinaigrette. I would pretty much eat a bowl of that stuff. The chef also sent out a special dish for us, classic Cacio de Pepe which is black pepper and parmesan sauce. Blew our minds with its simplicity, and a great example of the level of service here. We ordered the Homestlye Brisket with was served with fresh toasted bread, a horseradish dressing and some slaw. The Brisket was very tender and flavorful, and it was fun to make little open faced sandwiches as a group. This restaurant really gets it, from the friendly atmosphere to the beautiful cutlery which are served with each dish. Basically go here now, its worth getting there at 4:30 to put you name in for a take at 8:30.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Anne E.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"The meal we had recently at Rose's Luxury was incredible from start to finish, one that I will remember for the rest of my life. Everything was just superb - the food, the space, and the service especially. I think it is really special to find a place that is simultaneously so excellent and unpretentious, and for that reason I'm more than happy to add my voice to the chorus of five-star reviews here. Seriously, bravo.First of all, eating upstairs at the bar is just as good a way to enjoy the menu. We arrived on a Tuesday around 5pm to an already very long line, and when we got to the front we were informed by the (incredibly nice and articulate) hostesses that we might be able to get in for the second seating in 2+ hours. We had expected that and were fine with it, so we put our names in and headed upstairs to the bar to enjoy some drinks. The fancy Vieux Carrés were excellent. At one point, one of the bar staff said we could even eat up there if we put our names in with them, and lo and behold, we were seated within only twenty minutes! Then came all of the delicious, delicious food, one stunning plate at a time. My bf and our friend and I split what felt like most of the small plate portion of the menu, with absolutely no regrets. The house-made bread and butter that goes to every table was totally divine (some people down the bar from us didn't eat all of theirs... I stared at it from time to time for the rest of the evening, secretly wishing I had an invisibility cloak to go steal it). The crab claws tasted fresh from the sea. The Vietnamese pate on garlic bread was so scrumptious and dense with flavor that I wanted to lick the dish it came in (alas, inappropriate). And the pork sausage with coconut and lychee totally blew my mind as I would have never put all of those flavors together. Everything was just amazing, but I was particularly impressed with the pastas. Strawberry spaghetti? What?!?! Yes. Eat it and weep. We put in an order for that and the fettuccini with pea shoots, and out came... both of those, and the whole wheat regenetti! Indeed, the awesome bearded bartender who was serving us was so thoughtful that he just straight-up comped us a plate of it, since it happened to be his favorite of the three pastas and we had only ordered the other two. It was the icing on the cake. (Seriously, somebody give that guy a nice bonus... or a plate of his favorite regenetti. The service he gave us was outstanding with the perfect level of attention.)Speaking of icing on the cake, dessert just continued to impress. I went for the corn creme brulee and was so glad I made that decision. I am not sure how they infused such a wonderfully strong, seasonal corn flavor into the cream but it really, really worked. Our friend got the eggplant tarte tatin, which in itself is just such an awesomely creative idea for a dish, and it tasted equally amazing.I'm running out of superlatives, so I'll just say that overall it was an incredible evening. We never felt rushed. The place just makes you feel so treated and comfortable. As far as the few and far in-between truly fancy dinners in my life go, this is now the one to top!",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Emmy M.,"Providence, RI",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"A fellow Yelp Friend, Lauren B, and I visited Rose's Luxury last month and absolutely loved it!  We'd heard so much about it from other foodies and were so excited to try it.  Just a note for those who don't know - the restaurant opens at 5:30pm and there is typically a very long line that forms outside it well before that.  Even on a cold December evening, there was a line of at least 100 people before the doors opened at 5:30.  I lined up at around 5:15pm and they ran out of open tables (they also keep some open, to stagger the process) and we'd have at least a 30-minute wait for a table, so we opted to sit at the bar, which was fine because they served everything on the menu at the bar and it was a nicer experience to chat with our server/bartender.  The bar wasn't even that crowded and we were comfortably seated.I love the decor inside the restaurant - very modern chic, clean, and somewhat eclectic / unique.  I also loved the service - our server / bartender was very nice and helpful with her suggestions.  The food also arrived in a timely fashion, which is great considering how busy they are.As for food, everything looked so appealing to us and we were told that this is a tapas-style place.We ended up ordering:-Popcorn Soup (with grilled oyster) - this was absolutely delicious!  We each ordered a cup because it's not a large quantity, but still very good.-Mezze Rigatoni with Parmesan Cheese & Truffled Breadcrumbs - Truffled anything is good and the truffled breadcrumbs were extraordinary here!  We shared this plate.-Eggplant Parm with a little hand-pulled ""Mozz"" and house salad - We shared this dish as well and LOVED it!  So delicious!  2 plates and soup were plenty for the two of us and we also got some drinks on the side - two whiskey-based drinks with rose raspberry syrup.All in all, we had a fantastic experience at Rose's Luxury and it was well-worth the wait and the hype.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Pegah Y.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,4.0,"Some tips:-Come at the opening hours if you don't want to wait more than two hours. You might not get to be seated first, but you will get one of the earliest reservations or get to sit at the bar. My friend and I got here at 6pm, and all the earliest we could have gotten a table was at 9pm! - Get a reservation for a table and at the bar. The bar has full service for food, but they don't do the cellphone reservations, you have to sign up, and they will come get you. This means you have to wait in the restaurant, but the wait is shorter. My party got a table at 8pm.-Also, don't just go up there and wait for people to get up from their seats. We saw several people take people's seats at the bar thinking they would be served. They waited all that time and didn't get to eat because they didn't pay attention and ask the bartender to take their names down!! -When waiting, go to the bar and get a drink. There is seating upstairs behind the bathrooms that people miss. The drinks are as special as the food. Enjoy them while you wait and chat with your party then. Once you get your food, don't bother talking just enjoy eating!The food:-The menu is very seasonal, so I won't comment on the individual dishes and talk about the quality. I had no problem with the quality of the dishes and the preparation. However, I think the dishes are meant to be unique culinary experiences. I had a spaghetti dish with a spicy strawberry and tomato sauce. I've never tasted anything like it before and thought it was great. However, I can understand that not everyone wants to try something that unusual. The bartender told me that it was a hit or miss dish with other customers. You should know that the dishes aren't meant to be crowd pleasers for everyone. It's really the place for people with an open mind when it comes to food.Overall, I would say I had a great experience. Although I think it would have been better had my friend and I planned properly.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Candice P.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"Oh my goodness I just can't. The glory of this restaurant. It's been a week and I'm still at a loss for words - truly, Rose's is an experience for both the stomach and the soul.A friend and I came about 50 minutes before opening on a Monday night, and we were pretty close to the front of the line. I will warn you that the last 10 minutes of the wait is pure agony, but once you walk in the restaurant...ahhh, all is well with the world.The decor and ambiance are really something; Rose's is definitely one of the most photogenic restaurants I have ever been in, and they totally don't judge if you go in and geek out with your huge dslr (not that I did...). We're talking lights strung across the whole expanse of the ceiling, comfortably dim lighting + hip wooden furnishings that make the experience both casual and intimate, and an overall warmth that just can't be encompassed in words.If you can, I would highly recommending snagging seats at the kitchen bar! I mean seriously, it includes front row seating/prime paparazzi positioning of Aaron Silverman + a respectably diverse kitchen crew at werk.Challah bread + sesame/honey butter - man, their complimentary bread game is dang strong here.Popcorn soup with grilled lobster - Smooth, salty soup + chunky, not-so-salty lobster  + miraculously not soggy popcorn = perfect balance of texture and flavor. Pork sausage, habanero, & lychee salad - The hype is real and the 15 different ingredients also very real. Pork is on the salty side, but no matter because your mouth is too busy juggling the flavor explosion to really notice anyways.Whole grilled quail - Possibly the best dish of the night. The moderately tender consistency of the meat + subtly sweet/tangy mulled cider glaze (SO. GOOD.) = winner.Capricci Amatriciana - I'm not a big pasta person, but w o w this housemade pasta was soft, was smoky with a kick of spice, was covered with shredded sheep milk cheese, was yummies.Desserts are also quite unique - the minty/milky English pea cake and the chocolate mousse w/coconut milk ice cream + shredded lime just continue to showcase the impeccable attention to detail and flavor juxtaposing at Rose's. Elizabeth was a fabulous server - pleasant, personable, and so, so accommodating! She was super helpful with recommendations and dish explanations, and we could tell she genuinely wanted to make sure we thoroughly enjoyed our time there.I would say to just wait until you can wait in not-freezing-ice-cold weather...but who am I kidding??

4.5,4.0,"Yes, we all know that Rose's was voted best new restaurant in America in 2014... and for good reason! The menu is not extensive at all, but you can definitely see that careful deliberation and planning went into each dish. I recommend sharing even the small dishes so you can try a bit of everything. The family style dishes are literally family style aka huge! Menu changes every so often, but I hope the lychee dish is a constant, because I'd be happy just eating that.Standout items: lychee and pork sausage salad, rice salad, and family brisket.Come on a weekday to avoid the LONG lines! We were quoted 2 hours for a Thursday night dinner, but received a text within 30 minutes and seated shortly after! Dinner itself was an experience, as we eagerly waited in anticipation of the next dish. Lauren K, our oh so fabulous waitress, threw in the quail dish and (very) buttery risotto on-the-house! She never rushed the service and spent quality time chatting it up with every table. Rose's Luxury = hospitality at its finest.

4.5,5.0,"A place that actually lives up to all the hype surrounding it. You'll never have another meal like Rose's.I came to this place highly skeptical of all the praise thrown on Rose's. After being named the best new restaurant in America by Bon Appetit in 2014, you can't get within a mile of this place without arriving up to 90 minutes early (no reservations). Arriving at 4PM to stand in line with my group on a beautiful Tuesday afternoon, I was still seventh in line (one group of people were taking turns going to the Irish bar next door while they waited). At about an hour to opening there were 25-30 people. by 5PM, the line was at least 70 people deep. Keep in mind many people come to stand in line for their friends arriving later - you may be tenth in line only to have the amount of people in front of you double or triple as you get closer to opening. We were seated immediately in the front area of the restaurant. The place is decorated in a way that shows off the character of the old house it's in, while being very contemporary and chic. Our waiter Patrick, a tall skinny guy with a hipster beard/glasses combo, rolled up tight khakis and no socks expertly walked us through the menu. This wait staff knows their food inside and out, recommending that we order roughly 5-6 plates for a group of three. Despite the massive line of people right out the window, Rose's moves at a very casual pace. Patrick pleasantly talked with us, never rushing once. The food was brought out by a revolving doors of servers, who delivered each plate one at a time and described in great detail what was in it. Each. Time. I've never had service this good.So super hype, great service, hip interior - what about the food? To say the food was easily the best I've had in DC is a huge understatement: this may be some of the best, most flavor, and certainly most unique food I've ever experienced. First the drinks - I ordered the Gin, Wasabi, Green Tea, Lime, Ginger cocktail, which should taste disgusting but was actually very good - if you like wasabi you'll love this drink. Also the bread that came out - dear lord it was delicious, with a creamy butter too. Next was all of the food - the Pork and Lychee Salad ($13) was first, which we made vegetarian. It was a revelation - the taste changes three times in your mouth, from salty to sweet to spicy. The Grilled Avocado ($12) was topped with Cotja cheese with complemented the taste of the warm avocado perfectly.  The Chicken Fried Oysters ($3 each) are a must try - who would've thought tzaziki and dill would enhance the fried salty flavor of the oysters? The Grilled Pork Blade ($14) was cooked medium and melted in your mouth. The miso was a nice touch for a bit of salty flavor combined with the crispy and sour flavors of the cabbage and homemade saurkraut. Next out was the Charred Asparagus ($12) - one of my favorites of the night. The Pineapple Aioli in particular was to die for - sweet with a perfect balance of flavors (especially coupled with the spice of the jalapenos). Our last dish was the Martelli Spaghetti with spicy strawberry sauce ($13). I don't know how they did it, but it was both spicy and sweet, with noodles that were thick and tasted homemade. And oh the ricotta - perfect in every way. After receiving an erroneous dish, we were treated to a free *off the menu* pasta dish - noodles, butter, olive oil, topped with cheese, it was simple dish that was off the charts good (see the picture).For dessert, we ordered the English Pea Cake ($11) and the Eggplant Tarte Tatin ($10). Just when you think you couldn't be wowed any more, they make eggplant sweet and delicious on a pie crust and give you a bowl of mint curd, buttermilk, and pistachios, which shouldn't work but totally does. Of the two, the English Pea Cake is  the must try because I guarantee you've never had anything like it.If you're still reading and not running to stand in line for Rose's, you're a stronger person than I am. It was one he most memorable dining experience of my life and some of the best food I've ever eaten. It really does live up to the hype.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Cody Y.,"Philadelphia, PA",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington

Impromptu date night - taking my chances riding to the other part of town to walk into RL around 9 to see it - of course packed, buzzing and happening. Please go upstairs - a second bar wait list is being run there. No problem. Please put my name in and I will have a cocktail on your perfectly comfy couch.Wait. A. Second. Is that Kristen Kish?! Sitting on a chair across from me, waiting for her turn on the wait list?! Tremendous respect. To her - for winning the Top Chef. To Rose's Luxury - for not clearing the terrain around to let her sit down for a meal. Twenty more minutes of excitement, and before we even finish our cocktails they have  a table ready for us downstairs (a bit sad. Oh how I wish I sat at that bar instead!) As long as they seat you by 10 pm - the kitchen will stay open no matter what you order.Downstairs: pleasant staff. A new menu (yay! again!). Ridiculously unique, pleasing, exciting flavors: strawberry pasta, habanero sausage with lychees and coconut, sweet pea pie, hanger steak with eel sauce...

Explosion of flavors in your mouth.** We got the truffle upgrade for the parmesean cream rigatoni... worth all $25. Large flakes of truffle like I've never seen before, with the owner himself slicing them up.** I think their desserts are a little lacking...like trying too hard. I wouldn't mind if they threw in something traditional in there. I don't think I'm up for sweet pea cake ever again...interesting...but...not a big fan.Of course, I would come again.

4.5,4.0,"Rose's has been on my D.C. bucket list (aka: my running list of Places I Want To Eat) for a couple years now, and the time seemed right last week. My boyfriend and I spent perhaps an embarrassing amount of time strategizing about how best to approach Rose's. Should we go before opening & wait, or should we go later, around 8 p.m., and avoid a wait? Well, we did neither - I got there at about 6 p.m. and put our names down. They'll take your information and then text you when your table is ready, which is great. We went and had a drink down the street and the table was ready by 7:30.The interior of Rose's is gorgeous. It's whimsical without being cliche. The service is impeccable (as noted by pretty much every Yelper here!). But as great as the restaurant's design and the staff are, you're reading this review because you want to eat. So, let me break it down for you:Pork Sausage, Habanero, Peanuts, & Lychee Salad: served in a tiny bowl - the server encouraged us to mix it all together so the flavors meld, and it was amazing - spicy and sweet and entirely flavorful.Whole Wheat Reginetti with Chili, Garlic, Kale, and Dandelion Greens: the pasta was perfectly al dente, and though the portion size looked quite small when it arrived, I was starting to feel really full when we finished it...which was too bad, because next up was...The Brisket: This was my least favorite, but I'm one of those weirdos who doesn't like the fatty parts of brisket. I know it's supposed to be the most flavorful, and that TRUE bbq aficionados swear by it, but I'll take a lean cut any day. So, take my opinion with a grain of salt (delicious bbq -flavored smoky salt, that is). Rose's is a special treat for adventurous, unusual tastes, and I'd love to go back when the menu changes with the seasons.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Claire M.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington

Generally speaking, I do not recommend venturing on a whim to this establishment because of the long wait, but it worked in our favor.While the hostess informed us there would be a two hour wait, we decided to venture upstairs to this elegant/classy/funky styled bar with lounge seating on the size. We ordered cocktails off their ever-changing menu to bide some of the time. They were quickly served to us in gorgeous stemware/glassware. I could say gilded, but I'm sure it wasn't ACTUALLY gold. I'l keep dreaming that it was, though.As luck would have it, a couple was leaving two empty seats at the bar, which Hubs and I quickly snagged. We ordered pretty much everything on the menu along with the main of brisket. One of my favorites was the fried green tomato - just like you'd find down south. We were delighted with the menu, the pricing, and the unbutton-your-pants-because-you-ate-just-a-little-too-much feeling we have when we leave a restaurant we want to visit again.We'll be back - such a wonderful treat!!",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Anjali K.,"Fairfax, VA",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington

4.5,3.0,"3.5 Stars.I went here a while ago, like about three months ago, so this review may be a bit outdated.there was a snowstorm in D.C. and so my friends and I decided that it would be a fantastic idea for us to trek out to try this place. We were hoping that there wouldn't be a huge wait bc of the snow and boy were we right! Thank god for snow! When we got there we were immediately seated. The staff was friendly and very welcoming and the view of the kitchen kept the place cozy and open!We got their standout lychee salad, the brisket, i think some sort of carpaccio, and another dish that i can't remember. The brisket was just okay as well as most of the other dishes but the lychee salad was unique and that's what i enjoyed the most. The complimentary bread was also quite delicious.Granted that this place was unique and each plate had its own kick, I'm not too sure if i would come back again. Sad, i really wanted to love this place. :[",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Christie Y.,"New York, NY",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,3.0,"Cocktails are worth trying not to mention they have a wasabi flavored cocktail. Pork sausage w/ lychee salad is  creative & brings multiple flavors to the table. We had both dishes listed under ""family style"" - beef & Korean catfish. Beef is a bit salty on the side but tastes delicious; the catfish was so so. Recommend small dishes not the Korean catfish...Con: Wait is about 20-30 mins.

4.5,5.0,"When I think of Rose's Luxury the word balance comes to mind. Everything from the staff to the menu to the decor are sophisticated and have an appreciation for high quality and edge and yet at no point is there even the slightest whiff of portentousness or arrogance. This restaurant allows the average Washingtonian to have a high end culinary experience in a comfortable setting and at reasonable prices. I will not review all of the dishes because the menu changes but I will give a shout-out to the rigatoni in a Parmesan cream sauce which is obscenely decadent and incredibly flavorful. Some dishes were not as special as others, but there was not a single dish that was bad.I do want to address the line and the problem I have with it: having people line up for hours is exciting and a great compliment to your restaurant, but it looks bad for Washingtonians. For a city that has already been labeled as uncool or behind the trends it looks really lame for people to be in line and appearing so desperate. Yes, it's fantastic that Rose's Luxury is getting DC some attention and cool points in the culinary world, but give Washingtonians an easier way to support this great happening. Something should be done to improve this. Perhaps taking down names before opening time so people can visit neighboring shops while they wait for the doors to open - this would support business for the whole neighborhood. Something to consider. I don't think it would take away from the cool factor.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Stephanie W.,"Bethesda, MD",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"So, obviously there has been a ton of hype around Rose's Luxury, and I never thought to myself ""man, I really want to go wait in a crazy hour or two long line to get a table"". But then I found myself in Eastern Market for a volunteer event on a Wednesday, and my fiance and I were hungry after. I had parked across from Rose's Luxury, so as we walked back to my car around 7:30, I noted it didn't look packed so we decided to stop in.They politely let us know there was a wait, but there would be a table available in about an hour. Perfect! Just enough time to grab a glass of wine somewhere (in hindsight...we should have gone to the upstairs bar but we underestimated the delicisousness of Rose's). A little less than an hour after we added our name to the list, we received a text that our table was ready. Yipee!Once we got there, the first thing I noticed was how calm the restaurant is. I'm sure they could ""turn the tables"" faster, meaning sitting all the tables at once and then re-seating them as soon as they were empty to cycle through more diners. But Rose's wants the experience to be great, so they don't do that and it was lovely to have such a calm, paced meal. I never felt rushed or like the server just wanted me to leave so the next table could sit.We tried a ton of different things on the menu. And I'd also note that my fiance has a nut allergy, and most restaurants just kind of glaze over that and don't say much, just ensure we don't order nuts. But here, the waitress took the menu to the chef and he carefully wrote out which items had nuts, which may have been cross contiminated by the kitchen set up, etc. It was incredible attention to detail that didn't go unnoticed.We tried the hamachi tacos, grilled avocado, pork and lychee salad (no peanuts), grilled asparagus, and grilled pork with miso. We also started with bread and butter. Literally everything I ate was amazing. If I'm being super picky, my least favorite was the hamachi tacos. I'm not a huge fish eater, and while these were not fishy, it just wasn't my favorite. The pork and lychee salad really *is* that amazing, so do yourself a favor and get it. The flavor combo is unique and delicious, I could eat that every day. We also had the eggplant tart and ice cream sampler for dessert.  The eggplant dessert was absolutely delicious, I was so surprised. Eggplant dessert? What? But it was caramelized, and sweet, and the pie crust was the best crust I've ever had (sorry Mom!). Lastly, the price...not so bad! For the excellent food execution and taste, outstanding service, and wonderful atmosphere, this was completely reasonable. For two of us, with a couple cocktails total, several plates, and dessert it was less than $120. Not bad when you compare the quality to other places. I'd highly recommend to others and am looking forward to coming back soon!",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Beth K.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"Votes just aren't cast in Congress or at the ballot box, they are also cast with your feet and given the line out the door, Rose's Luxury is winning in a landslide! Believe the hype as Rose's certainly has earned its recognition as the ""Best New Restaurant"" in America in 2014.Given all of this hype, I was skeptical and a part of me did not want Rose's Luxury to live up to everything that I had heard. However, Rose's ran laps around the hype and more than exceeded expectations. We had a friend wait in line around 4:45 to get us reserved for second seating at 7:30. This was on a Wednesday so weekends might be more difficult. This gave us a chance to grab a drink at a nearby bar while we waited for a text from Rose's Luxury notifying us that we had 15 minutes to arrive in time for our reservation (followed by a personal phone call reminding us that we had 5 minutes). When we arrived the staff was extremely polite and gracious, thanking us for waiting in line and welcoming us to our table. They provided an overview of the menu. Each order came out as it was prepared and was accompanied with an explanation of what it was, how it was cooked, and a friendly joke or comment. From start to finish, the staff truly added to the experience. And now the food - come hungry...no wait, come starving! The four of us went for everything on the menu so that we could share and sample (this will come out to about $50-60 per person including tax and tip, not including cocktails). It is definitely worth doing this if you are able, as there were several items that we really enjoyed and may have missed out on had we not just ordered everything. Also, it really gives you a chance to take in the atmosphere, which is intimate and full of people enjoying their meals. Finally, we noticed several tables suffering from FOMO when some dishes came our way. Do not miss out! Go with friends and share everything!Everything was extremely well-flavored, tasted phenomenal, and left us all wanting more, until the next dish came and immediately caught our attention and appetites. If you go the entire menu route, you may be able to do without one of the pastas (although I cannot tell you which one, as they were all very good), or one of the family styles at the end (we had difficulty finishing the fish, although not out of lack of trying). Excellent service, amazing food, and more than worth the wait, special arrangements, or almost anything else that you need to do to get a table!",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Evan P.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,4.0,"Cyndy's Bottom Line:  Rose's Luxury (RL) always delivers 5 star well executed, sumptuous and interesting dishes.We decided to be brave and stand in line.  It is always fun to watch and see if anyone will drop out of the line and how far that will advance you to the front of the line. We checked in and they took our phone number to text us when our table was ready.  We explored the area and returned after 3.5 hours ready to eat, drink and be happy!  We were lucky to have seats at the kitchen bar area.This is what we ate:1.  Chicken fried oysters with raw oyster tzatziki.  Loved the oysters which were perfectly cooked.  I could have eaten a whole dozen by myself.  2.  Pork sausage, habanero and lychee.  This signature dish always surprises me with the robust flavors.3.  Grilled pork blade steak, miso, cabbage and homemade sauerkraut.The pork was well seasoned, juicy and tender.  The sauerkraut was outstanding and complimented the pork flavor.4.  Caviar and pasta.  We asked about the caviar and could not resist.  Caviar and pasta sounds like a brilliant gastronomic combination....The caviar pasta was life changing divine and delicious.  Loved the saltiness of the caviar and the buttery sauce which heightened the flavor profile together with perfectly cooked pasta.  BEWARE EXTREMELY DELICIOUS FOR YOUR TASTEBUDS...5.  Korean fried catfish with rice.  Great rendition of catfish meets gochujang sauce.  Very tasty catfish rolled with the robust flavor of the gochujang.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Cyndy K.,"Falls Church, VA",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,4.0,"Rose's Luxury deserves all the accolades they have received!  I loved the inventive, approachable menu and the gorgeous multilevel setting with two unique bars.  As you will most likely have to wait I suggest heading to the bar upstairs and enjoy a drink over some of the biscuits with shallot butter and onion ash.For your meal start with the pork sausage and habanero lychee salad!  It's a unique flavor combination that packs a punch and will make you wish they had an entrée portion.  Don't eat pork?  Try the crispy squid salad with avocado puree and crema.  Calamari has been done before...this dish made me love fried squid again.I enjoyed the smoked brisket, but the Texas toast and coleslaw were big time misses.  The Texas toast was really just toasted white bread and the coleslaw was dull and seemed like an afterthought.Dessert is what really won me over!  I had to show my love for the Pacific Northwest and order the Stumptown Coffee cold brew.  The bartender talked up the house made Irish cream to go with it and wow was he right!  My favorite dessert of the year is without a doubt the maple bourbon French toast with foie gras and cinnamon toast ice cream.  I'm generally not a fan of French toast, but this rendition wasn't overly soggy and the maple bourbon syrup was phenomenal.  The 3-4 oz piece of foie gras was daring and added a unique savory component to the already delicious dessert.  The cinnamon toast flavored ice cream was just the icing on the cake...well, you know what I meant.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Matt M.,"Seattle, WA",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,4.0,"I was really impressed with my first visit here and I thought many of the dishes served here were innovative and had unique flavors. I was excited for the second visit here, but I was disappointed with the new menu. We ordered some that were on the menu that we hadn't got last time and some that were new to the menu.

4.5,5.0,Came here for our anniversary and waited for 2.5 hours. It was worth the wait because we sat at the kitchen and were able to see the cooks and chef make magic. The service was great and everyone was super friendly. I love how the chef really cares about his dishes and has high expectations for the taste. I saw him say not enough of this or that for flavor and even throw a dish away and tell the cooks to do it again. My favorite was the Strawberry Spaghetti and Lychee Salad.,797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Victor T.,"Calverton, MD",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,3.0,"Every morsel of food has a burst of flavor. Whimsical, warm atmosphere from the light fixtures to the restrooms.To finally curb the hunger that had been building up, the challah was spot-on. Could I please have 4 loaves of that?  The honey-black sesame churned butter was heavenly. My fruity boozy cocktail was really tasty, in a beautiful antique-style glass and huge basil leaf. My friend had red wine.We shared the pickle-brined fried chicken, and the pork sausage lychee salad (many other reviews will tell you how that is), which I think were both over salted but still packed with flavor. Maybe it's because I've been cooking more lately and am more mindful of sodium intake. The boneless fried chicken had plenty of texture, the meat was tender and moist, and indeed delicious. Also tried the pasta with eggplant and tomato which I actually was hoping to make tonight with the fresh produce I bought.  I think, however, that the price of that dish was fairly laughable --$13 for literally about 6 pieces of rigatoni pasta.  Maybe it was the one fresh basil leaf they put on there that sent it over the top. :-PFinally, the dessert....  Unfortunately, a let-down. Not a fan of any of them. Sorry! I don't know the last time I said ""I don't like this dessert and can't eat it"" but I had to give that review to the English pea cake with mint curd, and the smoked celery marscapone. Just. Weird.Service was spectacular, and our waiter greeted us and talked to us like we were important friends.  I highly value customer service and I am glad that Rose's Luxury is recognized for its food and its waitstaff. We asked all our questions and he answered without any hint of impatience, and he always was around when we needed something.I also would like to note the obvious, which is either you have to be VERY patient to wait for a table of up to 2.5 hours, or have a dedicated friend go there early and put your name in, then wait at the bar.  I wonder when they will finally come down from almighty-level and take reservations.FOOD: 3AMBIANCE: 5SERVICE: 5VALUE/EXPERIENCE: 3",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Yumi R.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"Money doesn't buy happiness, but it will buy you a meal at Rose's Luxury... and that's pretty damn close.When a place has over 600 reviews on Yelp and a near perfect star count, there's little more that can be said about how amazing it is. Rose's Luxury is, in fact, unspeakably good and you don't need me to tell you that. It's Bon Appetit magazine's #1 Best New Restaurant in America and also tops GQ's list of 25 Best Restaurants 2015. Both awards could not be more well-deserved - dining here last night was easily one of the best (if not THE best) dining experience of my entire life so far. The boyfriend and I did plenty of research before arriving, primarily strategizing what our queueing strategy would be. We decided to arrive at 3:30 PM on Saturday afternoon in an attempt to be seated in the ""first round"" when Rose's opened at 5 PM. I was not surprised to discover that the line was already 40 people deep by the time we claimed our spots. Fortunately, the time passed quickly and I grabbed some tea from a cute shop down the street. About 20 minutes before 5, one of the employees came out and gave time estimates to each of the parties in line... we ended up being just near the cutoff to be included in the first round. Success!Once inside Rose's, I instantly fell in love with the decor. Romantic dangling strands of lights in the back room, vintage glasses, dishes, and silverware, candlelight, natural light... everything was gorgeous and reminded me of a less commercialized Anthropologie. Another stroke of luck/fate - my boyfriend and I managed to nab the last two seats at the Chef's Counter, where we were able to watch the open kitchen. I would arrive earlier next time JUST to reclaim these seats, as it was truly mesmerizing to watch the chefs work like a well-oiled machine. We were recommended to order 4 small plates and an entree (family style) or 5-6 small plates without an entree (which the parties next to us did). This ended up being the perfect amount of food, leaving just enough room for dessert. I don't think that I am talented to adequately describe the food... so I'll just list what I ordered. But I would be willing to bet that ANYTHING you get here will be delicious, because I was blown away.- Chicken fried oysters- Grilled avocado with cotija cheese (our server was kind enough to order this for us on the house - each dining party receives one free small plate!)- Pork sausage, habanero, and lychee salad (must have)- Whole wheat reginetti pasta with kale- Maple glazed carrots- Korean fried catfish- Coconut milk ice cream & burnt coconut & kiwi (dessert)- Ice cream tasting (cinnamon toast crunch.... oh yes, coffee, and avocado - we subbed out the banana) Rose's manages to wow you with just a few bites, but nothing here feels like it's ""too much"" or ""trying too hard"". On top of the sublime cuisine, the service is impeccable. All of the servers are so friendly and attentive. Rose's made me realize that, sometimes, we walk away from dinner feeling only temporarily satisfied by a full stomach. My boyfriend and I left that night feeling truly happier from the entire experience. On an unrelated side note - they provide bobby pins in the restroom. And rosemary mint soap. Seriously, no detail is overlooked here. Just by watching the kitchen for a couple hours, I could sense how happy each chef was and their passion truly translates within the dishes they prepared. I will be raving about this meal and the people behind it for a long time to come... and am already begging the boyfriend for us to plan our next trip here.Thank you, Rose's Luxury.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Margaret Z.,"Clarksburg, MD",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"Went here Saturday night with my Fiancée and another couple.  I've been trying to get to every restaurant on a Zagat article about toughest tables to snag in DC.  I'm starting to hope that one of the restaurants out of the 8 on the list will be a letdown, but Rose's Luxury was not one.  The four of us arrived around 4:15 and got a place in the line.  There was a lot of people watching and conversation to keep us entertained.  We lucked out and ended up being one of the last parties to be seated during the first round.  So we only waited an hour to get to our table.The restaurant has a really nice atmosphere to it.  Although, I did notice the first floor seemed like it could be loud.  We were seated on the second floor.  The restaurant is located in an old row home in Eastern Market.  My friend described the ambiance as going to Grandma's house for a Sunday dinner only the food here is better.For drinks one of the people in our group ordered the rye, rose water, sweet vermouth cocktail.  We all agreed that his drink tasted incredible.   It was like a cross between an old fashioned and a whiskey sour.Our server recommended that the four of us order five small plates and one family style plate.  We started out with the grilled avocado with tomatillo, pablano, cotija cheese & cilantro stems.  This was amazing.  The avocado was grilled to the point of a buttery texture and the cheese blended perfectly with it.After this we received orders of the scallop & rock shrimp ceviche with crispy plantains, and summer vegetable panzanella.  The three of the others in my group loved the shrimp ceviche.  I thought it was okay but nothing to rave about.  The vegetable panzanella was pretty good and had a very good brie cheese with it. Then we received the signature pork sausage, habanero, peanuts & lychee salad.  This was just as wonderful as everyone describes.  There was a coconut foam in the salad that added a nice touch to the flavor.  I'm already a big fan of pork sausage and lychee so I already knew I was going to enjoy this dish.We also ordered the grilled hangar steak, japanese mustard, eel sauce & scallions plate.  Out of all the small plates we had that night this was actually my favorite.  The hangar steak seemed to be cooked medium rare which is what I prefer.  The eel sauce added an incredible light bbq sauce type flavor over the steak and the scallions blended perfectly with everything.Our server threw in a complimentary order of the spaghetti with spicy strawberry sauce & this afternoon's ricotta.  This was really tasty and fortunately not spicy at all.  If you're trying to narrow down your small plate choices I would include this plate only after the avocado, lychee salad, and hanger steak.For our family style dish we went with the braised pork shoulder, peach bbq & summer sides.  I think they said the pork had been cooked around 36 hours.  It melted right in your mouth.  The peach bbq sauce had a small amount of habanero spice.  This sauce gave the pork this incredible bbq buffalo wing type flavor.For dessert we tried the ice cream taster which was a definite recommend.  The flavors included avocado and white chocolate, coffee flavor with dark chocolate, and cinnamon toast crunch.  We also tried the corned crème brulee.  It was really good but I preferred the different ice cream flavors since they were so unique.The bill came out to about $45 a person including drinks and tip.  This was astonishing to us considering the amount of food we received and the quality.  My friend that I was with said it's the best meal he's ever had for the value and I have to say I agree with him.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Jason H.,"Fairfax, VA",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"I am notoriously known by my friends and my ever-so-patient boyfriend, for being hard to impress at restaurants.  It's not that I hate things, I actually like everything.  But that's just it...I ""like"" a lot of things.  The BF and my foodie BFFs are always trying to catch when I am blown away. Well, ladies and gents, Rose's Luxury has done the impossible - they have earned not only 5 stars, but as I am sitting here writing this review, I am salivating at the thought of the delicious meal I had.  If I could give them 10 stars, I would.  For my birthday dinner, the BF so graciously waited in line, got a seating, picked me up, and surprised me with our dinner plans.  We ended up sitting at the Chef's counter, so we had an intimate view of the magic that is Rose's Luxury.  It may have been a Monday night, but the restaurant was buzzing and kitchen was booming like a Friday night.  First off, the service is spot-on. Our waitress, Kersten (I think I am spelling her name right), was ahh-mazing.  We asked her for recommendations and she knew her stuff.  She did not even blink to name us her top choices - and we were not disappointed.  She told us they have a few menu choices that have substantial staying power, but they tend to change up 1 or 2 items every month.  Here's a quick run down of our meal. Chicken fried oysters with dill sauce - So good.  What brought it home for us was the dill sauce and a green oil on top of the oyster.  Amazing. Smoked trout mousse - a light trout mousse with apple and trout roe.  Whoa.  It was totally not what I expected, but it was so delicious.  The mouse was atop these light crackers and the trout roe was perfectly salty. Pork sausage salad with lychee - Shut the front door. This menu item has been on the menu since Rose's opened and for good reason. It comes in a bowl with the pork sausage, red onion, peanuts, lychee. Ugh. Just get it. You mix it all together and eat it with a spoon.  This salad alone is worth waiting in like for.  i would wait hours for this salad.  It's that good. Ricotta stuffed gnocchi with crispy sunchockes and mushroom butter - these were super yummy.  Can you see the pattern yet? However, if I could live without one of these dishes, it would be this one, just because all the other dishes blew this one out of the water. Smoked brisket, white bread, slaw, and horseradish - This is one of their family style dishes and it definitely stuffed me and the BF. The brisket was so tender and melted in my mouth like buttah.  I didn't even need a knife, it just broke apart with my fork. The BF made the really insightful comment that he really appreciated the great juxtaposition of the dish (whoa - big word).  The brisket had no sauce, just great meat.  The platter came with toasted white bread, like what your momma used to pack in your lunch, classic horseradish (which could have had a bigger kick), and the most delicious slaw I have ever had.  Charleston ice cream - the item isn't on the menu, but Kersten gave us some to go along with our brisket.  It was rice with butter, gold flakes, and just melty goodness. Eggplant tarte - For dessert, I was skeptical about the eggplant tarte, but when Kersten said it was like apple pie comforty, I just decided to go with it because she hadn't steered us wrong all night.  The eggplant was cooked down to exactly what the perfect apple pie is supposed to be like and the vanilla ice cream atop it was extremely flavorful.  As a birthday treat, I got the ""special"" ice cream which was avocado and white chocolate.  You can't make this stuff up.  The BF goes, ""Of course, you want to hate it, but it's just so good,""  That's exactly what Rose's is summed up to be in my mind.  The dishes don't appear to make sense, but once you try it, all rationale goes out the door.  Oh and the Stumptown cold brew coffee Vietnamese-style.  Perfection.

4.5,5.0,"Absolutely delighted by my experience. Went in with a table for two on a Saturday evening--around six p.m.--prepared to wait for two-to-three hours. Luckily, my date and I were not starving and the weather was conducive to walking the Eastern Market neighborhood. We were alerted of our table's availability by text around 8:30.We still did not have an extreme appetite, and were uncharacteristically uninterested in pouring cocktails down our gullets, but this was Rose's Luxury: the Holy Grail of DC dining. The space is unique and has a lot of character and a bit of sass [check out the neon sign behind the chef's counter and the 'Employees Must Wash Hands' signs in the restrooms]. The employees do not wear uniforms, which was a refreshing change of pace. My date, in a black skirt, was not offered a black napkin; however, it did not strike me as a slight or as a missed step of service. The staff and space were confident, trivialities associated with fine dining were not of any interest. Mismatched silverware, antique plates, and the kitchen expediter wearing your grandmother's lacy apron added to the ambiance. For such a popular place with a consistently long wait, the restaurant and bar area did not feel cluttered or over-packed. The bathrooms had incense and candles. There seemed to be no missed details.Our waitress may have been the queen of the up-sell, recommending three items of the shared portion of the menu each. We stuck to our senses and ordered four items total, only to be reminded that the 'plates are small.' Our perfectly balanced cocktails arrived as bread was delivered, and we sipped the one libation for the majority of the meal. We each enjoyed three of the four dishes [disagreeing on two], but the ingredients were top-notch, seasonal, and well-prepared in all of the dishes. The Pork Sausage dish was deftly prepared vegetarian, with a spiced stuffing substitute.We additionally shared the ice cream samples for dessert--a pistachio-avocado, cinnamon toast crunch, and espresso confection that were pleasing combination, as each cleansed the palate of the other.We each agreed that we would be back to try the menu as the season and ingredients change.

4.5,5.0,"So, does it live up to the hype?  Yes. Is it worth waiting in line? Yes. From the moment you walk in, you're enveloped in the warm embrace that is Rose's Luxury. There's a reason many are calling this one of the country's best new restaurants. The atmosphere is funky and inviting. The staff make you feel like they're really glad you've come for dinner. The menu is brief, but brilliant. I could eat a giant bowl of the pork sausage with lychees and habanero or a ginormous plate of the house smoked brisket with horseradish and slaw. Who turns eggplant into dessert that tastes like tart tartin?  Magicians, that's who. If you can, grab a seat at the kitchen counter and ask your server to feed you.

4.5,4.0,"I'm slightly late in the Rose's Luxury game, but I am so glad I was able to finally check this place out :D  Owned by Chef Aaron Silverman (who has worked at Momofuku Noodle Bar and McCrady's), Rose's Luxury serves up Southern comfort food with a twist in a cute space with exposed brick walls, adorable retro chandeliers, and a small cabinet with antique teacups.  Adrienne M. and I came here to grab some dinner - we waited for about 30 minutes or so (as we were on 2 different waiting lists (one for a table, and one at the bar); just a note - they don't take reservations, so it's a first-come, first-serve basis).  I loved how there were seats where you can wait comfortably, and you're more than welcome to order drinks up at the bar as well.  We got a couple of seats at the bar, and I'm so glad that we did - this wasn't your typical claustrophobic/sticky/uncomfortable bar seating, but permanent-set swivel stools, a hook underneath the counter for your bag/purse, large spacious onyx marble counter (great to lay out multiple dishes), and, of course, lovely & attentive bartenders that totally dote on you!  We had a complimentary freshly-baked mini potato loaf with a side of whipped butter (sprinkled with chives and fried potato skin crumbs) - this had a nice crusty and crispy exterior that was soft in the inside - great for also dipping into sauces - so delicious!  The menu (which changes often) was short and sweet, with small dishes and family-style platters - we tried the Chicken-Fried Oysters with Raw Oyster Tzatziki (these oysters were small, but boy, were they delicious; the batter on them was nice and crispy, and they were set on a nice generous dollop of tzatziki sauce in their shell - yum!); Smoked Trout Mousse with Apples & Chervil (one of my favorites - slightly salty and creamy - MMM); Pork Sausage, Habanero & Lychee Salad (the 'famous' salad - you mix it all up; I really liked the chunks of the salty pork sausage in here; I didn't really taste the habanero, and the halved lychees were an interested complement); Grilled Pork Blade Steak, Miso, Cabbage & Homemade Sauerkraut (another favorite, the pork was cooked perfectly; juicy and flavorful from the miso, with the awesome touch of the homemade sauerkraut and cabbage!); Mezze Rigatoni ""Sausage & Peppers"" (another favorite! The pasta was cooked perfectly al-dente, and the slices/flavor of the sausages were surprisingly not overwhelming; the tomato sauce was more on the sweeter end, but still really tasty (definitely use that sauce with the complimentary loaf of bread they give you at the beginning!)); Ricotta Stuffed Gnocchi with Crispy Sunchokes, Mushroom Butter & Dill (I wasn't really a fan of this, as this was really sweet; the gnocchi seemed more like dumplings; I did like the creaminess of the ricotto filling, though); Fried Italian Eggplant with Shaved Feta, Anchovy & Wildflower Honey (least favorite dish of the night - this, while nice and well-battered and crunchy, was just overly sweet; the eggplant being sweet itself, the added wildflower honey just made it quite overwhelming); Korean Fried Catfish with Rice & Other Goodies (the catfish meat was battered and fried really well - but, this also was another least favorite, as the overly sweet red pepper paste just did not go well and was not a good flavor; there was some beansprouts on the side with cilantro (wasn't a fan of that, either), and some pickled daikon radishes (which were refreshing); and, the Smoked Brisket, White Bread, Horseradish & Slaw (one of my favorites - the smoked brisket, while more on the fatty side, was quite delicious - juicy and meaty, and great with the toast and the lovely creamy horseradish sauce and the pickled slaw - yum!).  For dessert, we tried the 'Eggplant Tarte Tatin' (I thought it was too sweet, with the caramel drizzle; definitely on the decadent side) and the 'English Pea Cake, Mint Curd, Pistachios & Buttermilk' (I loved this, as it was so different!  It was fresh, garden-y, mint-y, and I definitely enjoyed the moist English pea cake chunks in there!).  I also tried one of their cocktails, a gin-based 'Gin, Grapefruit, Cappelletti, and Thai Basil' (with a little more of the grapefruit) - this was nice and smooth!  The bartender, Mike, was just oh-so-awesome, and he checked up on us regularly and made sure that everything was perfect; I also loved Cesar, who brought out some of our foods - he had a great sense of humor and was such a sweetheart!  I would love to come back to try out their 'Luxury  Private Roof Garden' (only one seating a night, you have your own personal server and it's priced per person; it requires a deposit).  On a side note, RL also donates a portion of their proceeds to WFP-USA; you can check their website for the total amount donated so far, so I thought it was pretty cool.+potato loaf+Chicken-Fried Oysters+Smoked Trout Mousse+Grilled Pork Blade Steak+Mezze Rigatoni+Brisket+English pea cake+ask for Mike and Cesar :D",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Hannah H.,"Alexandria, VA",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"Before our visit to DC I scoped out restaurants to go to and this popped up on the top of the lists. We heard about going early to wait in line so we gave it a shot on a Thursday. Got there a little after 4:30 and were about 20 people back. Fortunately the area is good to walk around and shop so hubby and I took turns wandering around. Of course we got a table when they opened at 5:30...and not being ones to care what time we eat, we stayed instead of reserving a later time. And what a treat this was! We got a great table upstairs by a window and settled in for a wonderful meal with great service. We ordered drinks and they were so good we got more later. Ordered dishes:Smoked trout mousse: Holy moly - so tasty. More like an amuse-bouche though as they were gone in seconds. Pork Sausage & Lychee salad: One of the dishes we devoured before we remembered to take a picture. So different, imaginative, and tasty!Vietnamese Pâté; Oh. My. Yum.Oysters: I won't eat them but the husband said they were average and nothing special. Grilled Pork Blade: Like German food was finally good! (all you lovers of German food, don't hit me!)Uni Scrambled Eggs: Sweet child of mine.... this should be my breakfast every other day. Fettuccini: A little sweet but the right amount for what it was. Very creamy and definitely yummy.Grilled Avocado: We didn't order this but it got delivered to us anyway with a hearty ""ENJOY!"", so we did...and forgot to take another pic of this beauty. At least this one we could possibly attempt an inferior version at home...and will. English pea cake for dessert: Weird, sweet, and bowl-lickingly good. So we were very happy with Rose's and are so happy we got to eat here.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Laura P.,"Euless, TX",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"If you don't fall head over heels for Rose's, we can never be friends. Ok, I'm exaggerating (a little), but hot damn is this place excellent!To pick apart the menu would be fruitless since their offerings are completely dependent on the season. The first time I went I was taken by a sugar snap pea cocktail (see pic), but the 2nd time I went, sugar snap peas were no longer at peak season so the cocktail was out of the rotation.The great fun of Rose's is picking out the nuanced flavors. Can you taste the onion ash on top of the shallot butter? Or how about the coconut foam in the lycee and sausage (vegetarians, they have vegan sausage, fyi)? Their menu is so wonderfully playful that you'll have a blast tasting each bite thoughtfully.If you are looking for Cheesecake Factory sized portions, this place is going to fail you miserably. The philosophy here (which I agree with) is ""less is more."" I'd rather have 3 bites of something incredible (like their bucatini with sungold tomato sauce!) than a trough of something mushy and ill-seasoned.Service during both of my visits was excellent. I cannot praise them enough!

4.5,4.0,"Ya know a little hype here and a little hype there.  Bon Appetit rates Rose's Luxury #1 Best New Restaurant in America: Sound the trumpets! Trumpa-da-dah! #MusicManReferenceI really wish I could have made it before it became swamped diddly-amped, but, I ended up going 3-4 days after the announcement.  I arrived 40 minutes before the restaurant opened at around 4:50pm and encountered a line of about 70-80 people in front of me. So the restaurant opened at 5:30 and the line started moving fairly quickly, but when I got up to the host at around 6:00, I was told that it would be an 1.5-2.0 hour wait. Fantastic... I was like... I've invested enough time thusfar... so yeah... ""I'll wait."" 2 hardest words I've had to say in my life.  Other than ""I'll pay.""  Go a couple of glass doors down to Lola and have a couple of glasses of champ. About an hour and half later they text me with a message, paraphrased: ""you have 15 minutes to get back here or your reservation will be given up"".We get in and they serve us the most magical little loaf of challah bread.  It looks like it would fit perfectly in an easy bake oven. It is cooked perfectly, warm, strand-y inside; soft, a good amount of egg, and coated with black sesame.  It is ingeniously served with a ramekin. Yep just an empty ramekin for looking at. No... it is served with a ramekin with about 2 tablespoons of butter that is situated in a miniature pool of honey. The butter is topped with more black sesame and Kosher?Sea?Flat-cleaved salt. Money does not buy happiness. Cause happiness is this mini loaf of challah, and they serve this on the house. Next we try a half ounce of trout caviar. Served with miniature thin potato chips and creme fresh- this app is just ok. To me and my companion, it holds as a comparable fishy french onion dip substitute. Then we get to the Arc De Triomphe of food experiences: The pork and litchi (lychee) salad.  My companion states that she is not sharing hers. We are both getting our own.. and after I take one bite, I understand why. Coming to the table, you are confronted with a small bowl topped with lychee and red onion.  The waitress instructs you to stir. As you stir, you realize the orchestrated underbelly of this dish which includes but is not limited too: fried garlic, coconut powder, whipped coconut milk, pork sausage, garlic oil, peanuts, cilantro, and  the entire Mormon Tabernacle Choir!!! The depth, flavors, and roundness of the dish are impressive. It is gone in a minute flat. Then we decided to get the shellfish stew to share. Which I feel was the biggest miss of the night. Shellfish sit in a very marinara-y sauce.  Bright orange in color and shallow in depth. The fennel salad is good but too sparse.  Missing seasoning, and I don't understand the garlic bread served with it. We surely should have gotten the brisket, toast, and pickeled onions. A dish that was sitting at the table right next to us, and looked totes cruc. Waitstaff was on point. Wait in between dishes was a bit on the longer side, albeit the restaurant was packed to the gills, nay the eyes, and the kitchen looked a bit on the smaller side. All in all, an experience that I can't wait to recreate. Prices were very reasonable too!",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Mike B.,"Bethesda, MD",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington

I am so glad to say that my expectations were blown out of the water. This was single handedly one of the greatest dining experiences I've ever had. Our hostesses, Lauren, was absolutely amazing and hilarious. Thank you for the Carolina gold rice!The food was phenomenal. My absolute favorite was their signature pork habanero with lychee.  I would honestly sell my baby cousin to be able to eat that everyday. It was so good we had to order another. The chicken fried oysters were also amazing.The desserts. Oh god the desserts. I could bathe in the English pea cake with buttermilk.I will be back again and again and again.

4.5,5.0,"We had a really outstanding meal here. Very glad we made it a stop on our DC trip. We came at 5:30, because google says it opens at 5:30 on Mondays. Turns out that's wrong and they had already been open for 30 minutes. By that time the wait for 2 people was already at 2.5 hrs for the dining room. We went up the bar instead and put our name on that list, and waited less than an hour, so that worked out well. They have the full menu there, if you don't mind sitting eating at a bar.The food was all top notch. Potato bread with a really good bacon/scallion butter. Grilled avocado (served in the half-shell). Soft shell crab (I'm not a big crustacean fan, but still pretty good). And a brisket plate to share, which was really excellent, served with toast, slaw, and horseradish spread. I didn't catch her name, but our server/bartender was fantastic and even had the kitchen bring us out some delicious pepper noodle dish that was not on the menu, to fill the time between our starters and the brisket.All the food was superb. The service was excellent. The environment is great. Only downside is no reservations and a long wait.

4.5,2.0,"You know the place on 8th street with the line that starts before each open, this is the place; it continues to be like this each day but I'm not sure why.  I think many people that go here are impressed by things which can only be measured favorably if you keep relative to the DC Metro area. Even then, some aspects are sub-par and absurd.  Example: while at the bar upstairs waiting, the women next to us ordered drinks with one drink deviation from the listed ingredients to which the nonplussed, yet bottle of rage, bartender flatly said ""if you don't like it, you will still have to pay for it"".  The women were befuddled and we were, well, stunned.  Remember the dive bar in college you were taken to, like it or not, and the bartender who simply said you get what you are given.  Well, this place is no dive bar and they have no surly old butch pink-lady bartender!  Simply put: I'd never heard a bar staff saying this exactly and, yes, my respect for them then went farther south than strong geese in Winter.  I should note the meals were OK -- not bad, but neither great nor worthy of a wait for sure.  And, generally, the service just was terrible all around -- no we weren't treated poorly at the bar like the women, but we were rushed like pigs to the slaughter by hungry farmhands.  Every thing was fast, fast, fast and curt as if the owner(s) were threatening the staff in the back room every five minutes to capitalize on their relatively recent press and turn tables like Debbi did the Dallas metro area.  In any event, if you must go, then go and get it over with and move on to better places which DC has to offer.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Derek S.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"Friends and I decided to try Rose's Luxury since we were off of work that day. Our other attempts had been unsuccessful so we were super excited.  Everything about the experience was great but I wanted to offer a few suggestions in regards to waiting in line, etc.:*  If you are interested in the first seating (which is about 70 people), arrive at least 1.5 hours prior to opening.  We went on a Friday, so perhaps it's less crowded during the week but I wouldn't take any chances.  When I arrived at 3:30 pm for a 5:00 pm opening, there were about 20 people already in line who were holding spots for their friends.*  Bring a folding chair:  I did this and returned it back to my car once my friends arrived about 20 minutes before opening.  I was first hesitant about doing this (didn't want to look like a nerd), but I saw someone else pull out a chair and was thankful for it.  Standing for over two hours can be a bit much.  Plus, I received several offers to ""rent"" my chair (all in good fun) and heard people mumbling that they should have brought a chair with them as well.*  Bring something to read or do while you are waiting.  This sounds like a no brainer but I did see several people just standing there...Boring.*  If you want to sit at the chef's counter which overlooks the kitchen, get their early!  There are about 8 seats maybe.  Note however that you will be sitting on bar stools with no backs which could get uncomfortable.  We were able to get seats here for 3 people and it was fun, but a bit hard on your back.      Not really related to the line but there is one area in which you can make a reservation which is at the top of the restaurant and seats 12.  They open it up for reservations 3 weeks early and the cost is $125 per person (paid via credit card in advance).  You have a dedicated server and pretty much anything you want on the menu.Happy eating!",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Kai W.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"Rose's Luxury is an all-encompassing experience, and it lives up to the all the hype and praise surrounding it. Rose's was named 2014's Best New Restaurant in America by Bon Appetit. Chef/owner Aaron Silverman prioritizes the diner and goes above and beyond to make the customer happy. Rose's does not take reservations, which means diners have to wait in long lines before the place opens at 5:30. We had a friend wait in line for us. He got there at 4, and was seventh in line. By the time I met up with him just before opening, he was further back in the line because those in front of him were also holding a spot for their parties. Lucky for our group of three, we all arrived on time and were seated immediately at the front of the restaurant. Fresh flowers around the place and candles on the tables and beautiful pillows on the bench. The atmosphere is extremely casual and inviting. Our waiter, Patrick, approached our table and put us at ease, telling us to take our time to look over the drink menu, and then saying that he'd be back to talk food. Throughout our entire meal, Patrick was attentive, thoughtful, and patient. In fact, all of the servers were just as great as Patrick. I ordered a cocktail of tequila, ginger, jalapeno, agave and grapefruit ($12). It was very good, and it complimented all the food very well, which was a happy coincidence. We were given a loaf of Japanese bread with whipped honey butter. I could eat that all day. Patrick told us that, for a group of 3, we could easily eat about 5 or 6 small plates and one family-style meal. We stuck with all small plates. The first thing that came out was the pork sausage, lychee and habanero salad, which we made vegetarian (the pork sausage being soy ""sausage""). The salad also had coconut foam, sliced red onions, cilantro and peanuts. The server that brought this dish to our table told us to mix everything together so that we get a bit of each ingredient in every bite. This salad was quite possibly the best thing I have ever eaten. EVER. When mixed, the foam melts and creates a dressing over everything. The salad went from sweet and salty, to spicy, in three different stages. The peanuts and onions provide a much-needed crunch to the otherwise chewy ingredients. Every dish was as thoughtfully prepared as that salad. The other two in my group raved about the grilled pork blade. The grilled avocado, topped with tomatillo, onions and cotija cheese, was warm, salty, and crunchy, all at once. The avocado was melted in the center, and with the onions, was a great contrast of textures. The charred asparagus dish was a revelation. Grilled asparagus with pineapple chunks, fried and fresh jalapeno slices, pineapple aioli and chive oil, it was a perfect balance of smokey, sweet and spicy. The spaghetti with a spicy strawberry sauce and ricotta was our last small plate -- the sauce highlighted seasonal strawberries in a sauce that was a beautiful combination of flavors. The smooth ricotta melted in and paired amazingly with the slightly sweet, slightly spicy strawberry and tomato sauce. During our meal, we were accidentally given an extra plate of the asparagus dish, and when we notified Patrick of the error, he took the plate back and said he'd see what he could do. We received a complimentary, off-the-menu, cacio e pepe, a classic Italian dish of spaghetti, butter, cheese and black pepper. Absolutely scrumptious!We ordered two dishes for dessert. The first was an eggplant tarte tatin. The eggplant in this dessert was roasted and then glazed with caramel, then topped with a vanilla and olive oil ice cream, which was again topped with caramel. It was delicious and very sweet. The second was an English pea cake, my favorite dessert of the two. The dessert was pieces of a light English cake (made with pureed peas), served in a mint and buttermilk curd, garnished with candied pistachios and pea shoots. It was earthy, minty and not overly sweet -- a perfect way to end the most perfect of meals. Our dishes were brought to our table by a different server, who then described the dish in detail, including what it consisted of and how to eat it. Not a single person rushed us; we were told to take our time and enjoy our meal. Enjoy we did! Price-wise, no small plate is over $15, which was a nice surprise for a restaurant such as Rose's. The entire evening was a joy. Rose's is fine dining food in a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere, where you can wile away the hours with good food. I read Silverman's Bon Appetit interview after visiting Rose's -- it is worth a read for anyone that wants to try Rose's, and it gave me a new-found appreciation for the place. Run, don't walk, to get to Rose's Luxury! I want to go back again and again.

The deep fried oysters were ok. The asparagus was our favorite, creamy and full of flavor. We also got complementary pasta, which was nice of the restaurant. We shared two main entrees, the briskett and catfish. Briskett was tender and flavorful. The catfish, which was highly recommended by the bartender was only so so.

4.5,4.0,"Apparently voted by Bon Appetit magazine as the country's best new restaurant, a fact I learned from a cutie foodie 10 minutes before arriving. But did its fancy title hold up against a big 'ole hater, such as myself? Read on to find out...I can't believe you're still reading. So, here are the best parts of my experience there: 1) they're so freakin' friendly, 2) they are so informed and eager to talk about each dish, like it was some secret recipe handed down from their great grammie back in Poland, 3) the ""awesome"" neon they have hanging, 4) the ""fuck perfect"" frame they had in the men's room, 5) the sliced beef crudo was divine, never had better, 6) chicken fried oyster sounds better than its name and it really was, surprisingly delicate and sophisticated (like yo mama) and to round out my faves 7) the merengue/macaroon thingie that they gave us at the end. Yumz.And it's hater time now. The Rose's Hot Chicken, which is super spicy (not to me), fooled me into thinking it would be an enjoyable take on Southern Fried. Instead, it's a room temp black pepper spicy--simulating the heat, I guess?--giant chicken nugget on top of toast. Then they had this dessert that had fried foie gras which cinnamon toast crunch (like the cereal) ice cream, also on top of toast. It was the most expensive and supposedly most popular one on their menu, according to our awesome server, Janine. And guess what? It was gawd-awful. Offensive, even.

4.5,5.0,"If they gave out awards for ""Best Restaurant Bathroom,"" Rose's Luxury takes home the bacon, or should I say brisket? Let me be the first to nominate them in this category. Seriously, someone please make this happen STAT!If it weren't for a road closure and a detour on the way to Rose's, we probably wouldn't have scored rock star parking right in front of the resto. When we walked in, our wait time was a supposed 45 min. so we grabbed a couple drinks at the bar only to find out 10 min. later that a table was ready for us. I thank the stars for aligning perfectly that night.I can't remember the name of the cocktail I ordered but it was Thai inspired with a hint of ginger beer which was refreshing in the almost 100 deg weather that day.We ordered the following from each category:COLD: Jonah crab claws w/ pickled ramp and chive mayo AND the pork sausage, habanero & lychee saladWARM & GRILL: Jerk chicken, pickled mango raita, and green papaya salad. PASTA: Marco's gnocchi, black pepper & parmesan OTHER GOODS: crispy squid salad, avocado, crema, lime & radishFAMILY STYLE: smoked brisket, white bread, horseradish & slawThe more memorable dishes were definitely the pork sausage lychee salad and the crispy squid salad. You definitely cannot leave Rose's without trying these two flavor-packed dishes. They are absolute must-haves. The jerk chicken and gnocchi were equally tasty. The smoked brisket served family-style along with the creative desserts will top off your belly just right after the tapas-style courses. It is no wonder Rose's is on DC's high-demand list. The layering of vibrant, dynamic flavors in each of their dishes help build a climactic experience to a diner's palette which I think any food lover can appreciate. I totally respect their concept and what they accomplish here. If they aren't about being ""perfect"" they sure are humble about it.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Leslie J.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,3.0,"On a Wednesday night in January, we arrived about 5-10 minutes before the restaurant opened. There was a line of about 20 people already formed. About, 20 minutes later we found ourselves speaking with the hostesses. They were very friendly and efficient. Unfortunately, we didn't make the cut. It would be 2.5 hours before a table would be ready for us. We waited the 2.5 hours because we were with friends and enjoying ourselves. Of course the wait time makes the expectations rise a little. So, maybe my expectations were too high but they weren't met, that's for sure. I give 5 stars for whoever did the interior design. What a cute, fabulous, recycled, nook! I loved every inch of the restaurant. Even the platters they served food on were considered in the design scheme - well done. I give 2 stars for service. I noticed the servers were all dressed casually and in their own ""street clothes"". I wonder if they felt ""too"" comfortable and didn't realize they were there to provide a service. They just seemed laisez faire. I give the food 3 stars. It was just okay. Nothing wowed me or made me want to come back to taste it again. The one dessert our server HIGHLY recommended was so terrible, all 4 of us literally gagged and I think we generally will eat pretty much anything. The plus side, the place is uber affordable. So, even though I didn't love the meal, it wasn't overpriced at least.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Megan Q.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,2.0,"Fine, but TOTALLY overrated.  I've been twice & fortunately walked in without a line both times; both weeknights night about 6 PM.  With all the incredible reviews I thought maybe they were having an off night the first time I went & I should give it another shot, but my second visit was a repeat of the first.  Both times all of the pastas were completely overcooked.  Pasta really isn't that difficult to get right.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Amanda J.,"Falls Church, VA",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"Clearly one of the best and most interesting restaurants in DC. No matter the weather the to get in starts at 3pm (maybe earlier) until 5pm when they open the doors. Get there late and you may have waited in vain... The food is quite pricey but the quality is phenomenal. I am a decently picky eater but for the amount I was paying I figured I better at least try the different offerings. My favorite which elicited a happy dance while still seated was the pork salad with lychees. NOT TO BE MISSED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!!I was also a big fan of the brisket, even though I wanted a gourmet BBQ sauce, we can't have it all. The whole wheat reginetti was some of the best pasta I have ever eaten. I don't know how they do it but dammit I want more!! The oysters (I never eat those) the raw beef, (seriously?) Eggplant parm (ugh) grilled avocados (gimme a break) were all EXCELLENT!!! I hate all of those foods and I was asking for seconds and thirds. I cannot emphasize enough how good everything tasted. Give it a chance and you will wait in line for over 2 hours also... They have great wine and fine desserts also. Come hungry!!",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Roy S.,"Takoma Park, MD",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,This place was fantastic! We waited about 90 mins to get seats at the bar but it was totally worth it. We went to another bar to kill time and then returned to Rose's for cocktails before dinner. The food was unique and tasty. The bartender was super friendly and made great recommendations. Would love to go back here next time.,797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Caroline K.,"Mountain View, CA",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"This place is well worth the wait. I loved every dish and left feeling happy and super impressed. We were well taken care of. Highlights: Fried soft shell crab. Strawberry pasta. This sausage and onions dish that has a bunch of things in it that you all stir in together. The flank steak. The scallops were so delicate and amazing. We got this very garlicky pasta that I wouldn't recommend. For dessert we got the corn creme brûlée and a French press. The dessert was a really interesting flavor and texture. The cocktails were really good. They were very petit but potent and very delicious yet simple. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgable. I felt like all of the food runners were disgruntled with having to list off the name and description of the plates they were bringing out every night so it came off as mocking almost of the foody-ness of what they were saying. I got there at 5:10 on a Saturday. They open at 5. I should have gotten there at 4:30, because I didn't end up getting sat until 9:15 (they quoted me between 9 and 10pm).",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Amber Z.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,4.0,"After a year of flirting with the idea of getting or behinds in line behind 100 other people to eat at ""America's Best New Restaurant,"" we finally pulled the trigger yesterday.Setting the scene:Showed up at exactly 430 per yelpers recommendations to find ourselves behind 125-130 other people in line (the guy behind us actually counted lol - we were right next to the capitol sports store if this helps give you a frame of reference where you are in line). It is extremely cold outside and the wind is whipping through. At around 455, a gentlemen with a clipboard is telling the group in front of us that groups bigger then 2 will probably not be eating tonight. Luckily, it's just us two. Thinking that we can now duck into The Ugly Mug to wait it out, my toes trick themselves into pre-defrost mode. NOPE, clipboard man is just a teaser. We made it into the restaurant doors at 6pm just to put our names on the iPad waiting list. So yes, if you show up at 430, you may still be waiting out in the cold until 6pm. Tip: At this point, head upstairs and immediately put your name on the bar seats waiting list. It's not really first come first serve. They don't take your phone #, so you have to stay and have drinks there. The bartender told us 0.5 hour wait, but it was actually 1 hour wait - but still less than the 2.5 hrs the table took from when we walked in the door (so to get a table would've taken a total of 4 hours from when we showed up).We now that I've set the LONG scene for the excruciating process of getting a seat at this restaurant, finally can move on to:Food:1. Chicken Fried Oysters w/Raw Oyster Tzatziki - 3.5*- Either the oysters are really small, or cut in half. There is a delicious chive oil drizzled under the oysters that made the dish. They're really small, so 2 per person.2. Smoked Trout Mousse - 4.5*- We really enjoyed the delicate complexity of this dish. The mousse was light and freshly fishy. A few pieces of caviar on top for the luxury pop. Served on a shrimp chip. One of our favs.3. Sliced Beef Crudo - 3.5*- Basically beef carpaccio. Enjoyed the mustard oil and sea salt, but not too inventive in my book.4. Whole grilled quail - 3*- Probably my least favorite dish. It was burned. When you have such a tiny bird with such little meat, I truly believe you can't afford to burn it.5. Pork sausage, habanero, lychee salad - 4.5*- It lives up to the hype. So many flavors! Sweet, spicy. Hints of caraway seed and coconut milk.6. Mezze Rigatoni Amatriciana - 5*- This dish was the absolute highlight of our evening. The pasta was cooked perfectly. The light tomato based sauce is made with pork Jowl and has a an incredible refined smoky flavor. GET THIS DISH. Better, get two of this dish. Order a whole bucket. The bartender said this was his favorite as well, even trumps the lychee salad for him. This is probably the best pasta dish I've ever had.7. Duck egg spaghetti - 4*- Very rich. Enjoyed the duck egg flavor. Honestly could've used a little salt.8. Hakurei turnips - 4*- Very strong asian flavors in this dish bursting with umame. Served in a fish broth with tofu cubes. Pretty sure it was white miso in there. It was my husbands least favorite dish and probably the only one I'd say was really overpriced for what you got. It is brand new on their menu.9. Hot Chicken - 4*- Pretty darn spicy. And we love spicy food. Also a nice big portion, could be used as your main protein. Dish felt southern to me.All in all, I found the food at Rose's Luxury to be very good, basically a luxurious version of down home cooking, ironically enough.These 9 dishes filled us up so much that we wimped out on dessert. The bartender was nice enough to have delicious ice cream sent over anyway, but we could barely finish it. I'm disappointed that we didn't get to the fois gras french toast but...next time??Okay, which brings me to the wrap up here....was it really worth that line and will we be back. Honestly? Yes the food was DELICIOUS and I'm glad we tried it - but it was not the best meal I've ever had, not even the best meal I've had in Washington. I think this is the kind of experience I'd recommend one time. Get in line, build up the anticipation while waiting for 2-4 hours, eat the fabulous inventive food, and go somewhere with a reservation system next time.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Cathy K.,"Alexandria, VA",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"My bf and I have attempted to eat here on several occasions, however the wait was always crazy long for a table. Well, the stars aligned last night and we were able to get a table (waited about 2 hours-no biggie, there are great bars around the hood to go to while waiting)! The wait staff was amazing. All were pleasant and not at all pompous (after all Rose's Luxury is rated the #1 restaurant in the country). They gave us a few options for seating, we ended up snagging the kitchen bar seats so that we could watch the chefs prepare the food. Now on to the food. Their complimentary Japanese bread with the toasted sesame seed and honey.....a mouth orgasm yall. I mean. The free bread was amazeballs. Fresh and warm and sweet and fluffy all at the same time. I'm not big on bread but damnit I could eat their bread all day long. Some of my favorite things that we ordered:1- Lychee pork salad : spicy, sweet, savory all at once in your mouth. I loved it!!!! Definitely not for everyone (my bf didn't like it, thought it was too spicy) but I loved it so much! 2- Grilled pork blade steak: get it get it get it. I can not express how much I think you should get it. 3. Rigatoni with sausage: omg. You could taste the freshness with every bite. It was so simple and beautifully prepared. Get it get it get it you guys! 4. Ice cream tasting platter: they had banana, coffee and cinnamon. Best ice cream I've tasted. Overall- this place definitely is worth the hype. There is a simplicity to Rose's that you just don't seem to get with other famous restaurants. The ingredients in every dish was fresh which really added flavors to the dishes. All simple and yet prepared to perfection. I'll definitely be coming back (if we can get a table). Try going early around 5pm, you should be able to get a table for a late dinner!",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Vy L.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,4.0,"I have never been so delighted with a restaurant's service, food quality, ambiance and decor. My friend and I each ordered a pasta dish and drink. The kale pasta she got was apparently delicious but the highlight of her meal, which I sampled as well, was the AMAZING glass of white wine highly recommended by the bartender (we were seated side by side at one of the bar-like areas downstairs, which was still quite private and not at all crowded). My pasta, perfectly topped with soft Parmesan and mixed with peppers and sausage, was delicious and high quality. The service was great, the complimentary loaf of bread with sesame butter came out warm and perfect, and the chef's complimentary amous bouche featuring vegetarian sausage, onion, and other fresh ingredients introduced us to flavors we'd have never tried otherwise. LOVE this place and will be back. Only downside - long wait, small portions. Otherwise one of the most delightful places in DC for young professionals and hipsters alike to have a classy-yet-unfussy dining experience.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Katie C.,"Seabrook Island, SC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"This place was amazing. The food was excellent. The ambiance is elegant and friendly and inviting. We did have to wait a bit for a table, but it was worth it. We had a few glasses of wine at the upstairs bar before eating, which is a cute little area with both tables and couches. Then we were escorted to the kitchen table, where we got to watch the chefs cook up the dishes while we ate. The homemade baked bread was delicious. So warm and soft. We ordered the quail dish, which was quite good. Moist and herby. We also got a pasta dish (maybe raviolis?) which were also tasty, but the star of the evening was the family style smoked brisket. You HAVE to order this. Lastly, the dessert we picked was this bizarre mint/pea ice cream thing, that was a total risk, but definitely paid off. Stretching outside your comfort zone is a definite must at a place like this.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Trisha H.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,3.0,"Okay, I get it, the food is amazing and surprisingly not the most expensive I've had in the last few weeks.  HOWEVER, for me the wait (really just the completely inaccurate wait estimate we were given) just killed it for me...Ryan and I went on a Tuesday after hearing that this is one of their ""slower"" days.  Not only that, it was FREEZING out after the first DC snow of this year -- so we were hoping this would mean maybe an hour wait or so.  I arrived at around 6:10 and was told that there was a 2.5-3.5 hour wait for a table.  Upstairs, the bartender told me it would be 1.5 hours for seats at the bar (which does serve a full menu). So we put our name down for both options and waited.  And waited.  And waited...  Two and a half hours later, we finally got two bar stools (where my feet hung a foot from the floor for the whole meal).  Ridiculous.Anyways, the food WAS good (but not 2.5 hour wait good).  While we chose our dishes, they delivered some pretzel bread, which was warm, fluffy and topped with sea salt for good measure.  It came with a pad of butter sunk into a few tablespoons of honey - kinda odd, but a unique touch. The first dish to arrive was the Mezze Rigatoni w/ Parmesan Cream & Truffled Breadcrumbs - this was one of the highlights of the meal with a rich, creamy sauce.  The breadcrumbs were a nice touch of crunchy texture that we both really liked.  The Honey-Glazed Carrots, Mascarpone, Matzo Meal & Dill came next - they were cooked perfectly and the sauce was an interesting combo of bursting flavors.Then, a surprise from our bartender arrived - a free dish - namely the Pork Sausage, Habanero & Lychee Salad, which ended up being my favorite dish of the night!  Following the waiter's recommendation to mix it, the sauce perfectly complimented the strange, yet suited combination of ingredients. The lychee was particularly odd and the pork succulent and delicious -- and together it simply just WORKED.  I wasn't a big fan of the Classic Cacio E Pepe - it tasted like it contained the same pork from our salad dish, and I wasn't especially fond of the flavor overall.  My date seemed to enjoy it though.  By this point, we were both getting full and had completely forgotten about our last dish -- the ""Hot Chicken"".  Like the other before it, it was a completely unique dish -- chicken on a slide of bread with some sort of sauce and onions.  I was a big fan of it, but will warn you that when it says hot, it truly means SPICYYYY - so probably save it for last because it will completely blow your palate with intensity and you won't be able to enjoy the complex flavors of the other dishes.In sum, the food was superb but I'm simply not sure why it's THIS popular. Worth trying if you have the patience of a saint, but I don't think I'll be making a second visit.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Emily H.,"Hyattsville, MD",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington

4.5,5.0,"Popcorn soup with lobster. Sausage, habanero, lychee salad. Every, single pasta on the menu. These were a few of my favorite things. To describe them in detail would be pointless, because with 488 other reviews, I'm sure you can find a detailed description if you need it. But for what it's worth, that is how I'm casting my vote when it comes to the food itself (and we tried almost everything on the menu). Here's why: The popcorn soup and sausage/lychee salad top the list for originality. As for the pastas, they are all winners in a completely different way--they are perfectly executed versions of comforting, classics.I always go to restaurants for the food, but warm service and a good vibe never hurts. And in addition to the fantastic food, Rose's has both in spades. Everyone we talked to seemed absolutely stoked to be working there, happy to be serving us, and genuinely excited to offer recommendations. But the service was not intrusive or suffocating. The whole restaurant felt relaxed, friendly, and shockingly low-key (in a good way) for a place that has a line out the door before they even open every night.Now I'm not going to lie, the whole experience was not hurt by the fact that my dear, dear friend waited in the line for over an hour (in the drizzly rain) to put our name in. I just rolled up to a nearby bar after she did the hard work to drink cocktails and wait with her for the table. It was my birthday, so it was a very kind gesture on her part. That being said, I'm willing to wait in that line (although maybe not in the rain) for another chance to eat at Rose's. And I freaking hate lines. (See: I've never had a Georgetown Cupcake.)Some friends and I have a running joke, whereby when we say something is good, we might emphasize it by saying ""definitely top five X"" (top five bites, top five burgers, top five divebargrilledcheesesandwiches etc.). Ostensibly we're mocking the obnoxious popular habit of listing favorites, even though inwardly we clearly find ourselves struggling against the irresistible impulse to do the same thing. To categorize, to put experiences in neat little boxes. So! As the year draws to a close, I have to say: Rose's was definitely in my Top Five meals of 2014.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Kate N.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"Probably one of the best meals I have ever had.I ended up cozying up to the bar. Started with the rose and rye drink. OMG if I could drink more, I would have had those all night.Had the pork sausage and lychee salad. Pretty good, but actually my least favorite of the meal. I don't really like raw onions, that's probably why.Next I had the crispy soft shell crab with asparagus and white balsamic. This was the STAR! You must try this one!The bartender sent over the cacio e pepe. Amazing! Love at first bite. Perfect texture.I ordered the spaghetti with spicy strawberry sauce and ricotta. At this point, I was stuffed and ready to waddle out of there. So I took a few bites and had it wrapped up to go. The flavors were totally unexpected. Sweet but a little spicy, some bite.

4.5,3.0,"I hate to say it, but yes this place is definitely overrated. Was it still a pleasurable experience? yes!! was service awesome and our server very  knowledgeable? absolutely. However, the food was only ok. The hamachi tacos were fresh, but just lacked a little bit of flavor. It was very underwhelming. However, the pork sausage and lychee was my favorite from the night. The sweetness from the lychee and the saltiness from the sauage was a really delicious combo. The grilled asparagus  - while cooked perfectly, was still not a wow factor. Even the smoked brisket (Family style) was on the drier side with a ton of fat (which as an asian and used to this type of meat, i love, but i can see how non asians might not love this) although the slaw that came with it was refreshing and tasty. Of course, being the fatties that we were, we ordered both the pea cake and the coconut dessert - both were very delicious and s i think if the pea cake didn't have all of the extra leaves in the dessert, I would've probably loved it even more. Overall, we were lucky that we didn't have to wait long for the meal, but if it was like any of everyone's stories of waiting in line and being on a wait list for hours, we would've been pretty disappointed. Otherwise, a solid spot, but nothing to go out of your way for and definitely not wait for hours in line for.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Anne C.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,4.0,"Great restaurant with a disaster of a ""reservation"" system. That said, I  get that this is a popular hip restaurant that's going to fill every seat every night so they can do whatever they want and not give two damns. The problem isn't waiting in line - that's expected. The problem is that everyone in line seems to be holding a spot for 3 other friends. So when you show up at 4:30, look at the line and count 40 people in front of you, it doesn't seem so bad. By 5:30 all the friends showed up, cut you in line, and now there's 100+ people in front of you and it's unclear whether you'll actually be seated for the first service or not. But I digress. Once you're in your seat at your table the dining experience is quite excellent. Servers know what they're doing. Beverage glasses are never empty. And the food is all delicious and pretty creative (some dishes better than others, obviously). You're looking at around $120-$140 for a couple (one drink each, food, tax and tip).

Again, DC cuisine just can't hold a candle to SF, LA or NYC, however Rose's Luxury is pretty damn close and can definitely play with the big boys.

We told them ten times it was my Birthday, and nary a candle or acknowledgment did we get - like having an Xmas Bday is not bad enough;)2. We waited 2 hours for a table3.

4.5,5.0,"I've been wanting to come here since it opened. There's always either a line halfway down the block or a wait of 1-3 hours. So, randomly, a friend and I decided to give it a shot last night and there was only an hour wait. We headed upstairs for a drink at the bar while we waited. The decor is awesome. Antique (think stylish and cohesive, not dated and mismatched) pieces are everywhere and perfectly suited for the meal that was coming. It felt like being at your favorite aunt's house. From the moment we walked in until the moment we left, the service was awesome. Everyone was very kind and warm which enhanced the familiarity feeling.Now the food. I don't know where to begin because each bite made me thank Jesus for the experience. First we had caviar with homemade potato chips. I don't remember the type of roe (they have a separate menu) but it was yummy! This was paired with a glass of complimentary champagne. Extra yum! Next up, the popcorn/lobster soup. To which all I could say was...YES! So creamy, so soft, so divine. Then came the pork sausage, habanero and lychee salad. The ingredients are in a bowl and you're instructed to stir then eat. This was, without question, a party in my mouth and I wasn't invited. We then had the quail which was seasoned perfectly with a cider glaze. If there was something else on that plate, I don't remember because the quail was the star.Next, yes there's a ""next"", we attempted to eat the brisket. Honestly we were so full at this point we could hardly move but...we persevered. The brisket was SO tender, it was difficult getting it to stay on the fork! It came paired with horseradish, toast and slaw. Soon after it became paired with a carry out container because we reached our capacity. Since we were out pre-celebrating my birthday, and the staff knew, I was given a treat. An avocado and pistachio ice cream. Now these are two ingredients that, separately, I can do without. Howsomever, it was pretty darn tasty.I, definitely, see why this was voted the best new restaurant in 2014.Go. Believe the hype.

The food had such interesting flavors and combinations.  Things I don't even like (like lychees and kumquats) I craved to eat more of! The decor, service and booze were awesome and I really appreciated how everyone took the time to explain the menu to us properly.

If I had to choose a favorite, it would be the buttermilk bread and the pork sausage dish. Also the avocado dish was incredible. But really, everything on the menu was so good.

4.5,4.0,"Came here on a shower filled Thursday at 7 and was told to expect 1-2 hour wait. We were seated around 8:30.The place is homey and understated, nothing pretentiously modern, excessively eclectic, or dramatically dark. Just clean, relaxed, and welcoming. The focus is definitely on the experience, the dining company and the food. While our server pretty much abandoned us for the majority of our meal, the busser and the food runners were beyond polite and attentive.In terms of the food, the lychee salad was a standout along with the soft shell crab and asparagus. We also ordered the avocado with cotija cheese... I'm a sucker for cilantro and avocado so I enjoyed the dish but it just lacked that extra element of surprising flavor that is characteristic of the other menu items. The two pastas we tried were whole wheat reginetti with kale and the strawberry spaghetti with ricotta. The whole wheat was disastrous and way too salty. So bad I contemplated about sending it back but our server was nowhere to be found. I liked the inventiveness and creativity of the strawberry and ricotta though it was just a tad spicy for me. We were treated with a complimentary cacio e pepe that was well executed and delicious that I wish was on the menu.Overall, I do like the fact that roses luxury is all about the food and a waitstaff that elevates the experience. They course out the dishes so it arrives timely to each dining party. However, I was a bit disappointed that the dishes were not equally executed with the same precision given the rather limited menu options. Due to the strength of the other dishes and the feel of the restaurant, it warrants a return visit.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Kelley D.,"Rockville, MD",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,Perfect dinner date place! Service was above and beyond and the food was somewhat life changing. Obviously we had to wait a long time to get our table but it was completely worth it.

4.5,5.0,"This was my third time trying to get into Rose's. We lined before 4pm on a Friday to get a table and both other times after waiting for more than an hour we were going to be in the last seating so bailed out.So you may be thinking is it worth waiting that long outside at that?? After eating here, the answer is a resounding ABSOLUTELY!! It was one of the best meals I've ever had.The menu seems like nothing special just normal small plates, but the way they prepare the food is amazing and so unique. Even something as simple as a grilled avocado was the best I've had. Our favorites were the cheese stuffed gnocchi, Asian style catfish and the eggplant parm. The desserts were also some of the best I've had. I usually dont love ice cream but their cinnamon ice cream and banana ice cream HOLY AMAZINGNESS! It was so fresh.The menu changes regularly so these may not be on it again but I have full faith it is always as good. Not too pricey either but you definitely won't get out for under $50 per person if you try a fair amount of the small plates.",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Sam Z.,"Raleigh, NC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington
4.5,5.0,"Stop what you are doing now and go get in line at Rose's luxury now!  They do not take reservations so getting there before 5pm is a good idea.  You will likely get seated promptly if you arrive on a weekday but weekends are a different story.We arrived right at 5pm on a rainy Tuesday and would have been seated right away but we were missing 1 of our party of 4.  The three of us already at the restaurant went to the bar upstairs and had some delicious cocktails.  They were kind of like what you would get at a craft cocktail specialty spot.Once our final party member arrived we were seated.  We ordered several appetizers but we could have done with none of them because the biscuits and butter combo that is sent to the table is a delicious appetizer in and of itself!  We ordered 2-3 baskets of them because we kept going through them.  By the time the food arrived we were already stuff but we decided to fight through it based on the amazing recommendations.  I know, not everyone is up to such a challenge but we are a different kind of foodie.  We can't stop, won't stop.The highlight of the evening was the brisket.  It was a generous portion and delicious.   The gnocchi was great and I also enjoyed the cauliflower - and I don't even like cauliflower!The best part of the evening was the value.  For a fine dining establishment in DC with outstanding service, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good value for fine dining in DC.Don't let the wait scare you, go ahead and get check this place out on a random weekday!",797,"Washington, DC",Roses Luxury,Dipesh P.,"Washington, DC",2025808889,/biz/roses-luxury-washington

5.0,5.0,"I was excited when Nido opened up because it's super close to me! Which means I can get there early and have my pick of seats, enjoying the space before it fills up.Sitting in the window is really nice-- definitely try for that area if you can. The robin's-egg blue and white color scheme lends an airy feel to the whole place, which has a bird/nest theme. Since the focus is on small plates, it's great to get the chickpea puree or ricotta to start. Both have very generous portions (not enough bread, but they're happy to bring you more for free) and are some of the best versions of the dip/spread I've had. They're both drizzled with a bit of olive oil and coarse salt and pepper, which really accent the flavor. For the small plates, which change frequently, I really like the tender duck (though the fat under the skin could have been rendered just a little more, I think) and little clams that have a  yummy sauce. The swordfish was a tad dry but the romesco sauce definitely helped, and it was nice to have a rounded mini-meal on the plate with the patatas bravas and rapini. The pappardelle wasn't my jam but my friend really liked it. I think I like a ragu-style sauce more than having chunks of pork-- the lemon was an interesting touch though, that brightened the whole plate. Don't overlook the salads! The baby lettuce salad was lightly dressed (yay!) and even had blue cheese, which I normally don't like, but since it was used in such moderation and balanced well with the rest of the ingredients (apples, spiced walnuts, raspberry vinaigrette) it worked for me. Last time, I got a dish with lima beans, corn, tomatillos and tomatoes that was also super refreshing. There was some type of basil in it that we couldn't quite identify, but tasted almost lemony, tying together the great end-of-summer dish. It was definitely more crowded this time, which is a good sign-- I think more people should know about this place, which is helping to fill the void between Bloomingdale and Hyattsville. Hope this trend continues!",40,"Washington, DC",Nido,Karen S.,"College Park, MD",2026272815,/biz/nido-washington-2
5.0,4.0,"A restaurant not to judge by its cover. We found this place on Yelp, and when we rolled I'll admit I was a little suspect. The area is dimly lit with little to no street lights and the place does not have a light up sign. However, when we walked in my impression took a 180. Inside is very warm and simple. There is also a fun downstairs room for a little bit more lively experience in case you have a group and want to be a bit louder.We about 6 dishes and very pleased with each one. However if there is one thing you must try it's the grilled octopus, that was my favorite.They also make fine cocktails here which compliment dinner really well.",40,"Washington, DC",Nido,Mark S.,"Arlington, VA",2026272815,/biz/nido-washington-2
5.0,5.0,"Whoa, Nido. Slow down. Save some for the second date. I know first impressions are important, but you didn't have to try to sweep me off my feet so soon. I do have to admit, though, I'm already looking forward to our next little rendezvous. Just, you know, play it cool, don't tell Sonoma or Floriana, I don't want them thinking we're already an item. Yet.So yeah, safe to say, this place absolutely wowed me on my first visit. The tiny and cute blue exterior makes it look like it could be a shop selling flowers or arts and crafts, definitely outpacing the rest of the neighborhood a bit. The interior is small but open and airy and light, the decor is spartan but inviting, right out of some modern design magazine. The service is friendly and attentive, and the overall feeling of the place is that you're just visiting some friends who are great hosts with a particularly nice and upscale dining nook in their kitchen. Our server was super helpful with recommendations, especially helpful with gauging the size of dishes and how many we'd need, and when I asked her to bring me a red wine that would pair well with our selections, whatever mystery red she brought nailed it.The food perfectly mirrored the simple yet elegant ambiance, with dishes that didn't overwhelm the palate but still provided a sensual joy in each bite. Seriously, when you order chickpea puree, you think you're just getting hummus, yeah? Whatever came on that plate was smooth and creamy enough to make the executives at Sabra commit seppuku with shame. Pappardelle with pork sauce and parmesan always floats my boat, but some genius in Nido's kitchen decided to add some lemon and give the dish a delightful lightness. In all, my party of four ordered maybe seven or eight dishes, and upon walking out we all agreed that there wasn't a weak offering among them.My first meal at Nido was like one of those early exciting kisses with your new girlfriend, you come up for air and already can't wait for the next one. Fortunately I think they have enough love to go around, so I advise you to rush over and get in on this hot steamy affair right away.",40,"Washington, DC",Nido,Joe L.,"Washington, DC",2026272815,/biz/nido-washington-2
5.0,5.0,What a nice surprise. Just down the road from pawn shops and liquor stores on and undistinguished part of Rhode Island Ave. is this tiny gem. Beautifully and tastefully decorated. Wonderful service. A simple generous menu. And of course delicious food makes this a restaurant you need to visit.On this day we had brunch of Gigante beans chorizo and upside down blueberry cake.

5.0,3.0,"I hate to be the one to point out that the emperor has no clothes, but this place was a big disappointment for having such high reviews.  Bright, simple decor, open space, and quick service.  No marks off for any of those. But the wine was mediocre, overpriced, and the pours extremely stingy (perhaps 3-4 oz).  For $14 per glass I expect much more.  The octopus dish was tasty and the highlight of our meal.  The cauliflower dish with harissa was poorly executed--essentially just raw cauliflower placed on a plate of sriracha.    The parpardelli with pork was pretty good, a solid B.  The tab was over $100 with tip and we were still hungry. Would maybe give it a shot in 6 months to see if it's gotten better, but in no rush to go back.",40,"Washington, DC",Nido,Adam M.,"Washington, DC",2026272815,/biz/nido-washington-2
5.0,5.0,"This review isn't only because the food was fresh and fantastic, but because I really want to see this place succeed.Don't let the location deter you from going.  This is the perfect setting for most things worthwhile.  Rhode Island NE is on other spectrum of City Center, with more to offer at this one single establishment than all of City Center combined.We were hesitant at first, due to the perfect reviews (questionable), the sketchy drive, and the rub with the hostess prior to being seated at the bar.  Everything from that point on, was perfect.  We built a relationship with the bartender, and everything that was delivered to us gastronomically was deeelicious and innovative.  It was refreshing to be able to taste things that we've had a hundred times before, presented to us in a whole new light.  Everything was made perfectly, and this isn't something I'd admit openly very easily.  The only complaint I have is that the small plates were small, and it leaves you wanting more. In the end, this isn't a true complaint, because it only leave me wanting to come back for more.",40,"Washington, DC",Nido,Casey N.,"Silver Spring, MD",2026272815,/biz/nido-washington-2
5.0,5.0,"Per the recommendation of a friend, my wife and I ventured 15 minutes from the Hill due north to try Nido for ourselves and we were NOT disappointed. A solid 5 star rating.Atmosphere: It's simple, yet beautiful inside from the tables to the place mats to the bathroom. If you like simple and clean, this is your place.Food: Amazing. Definitely get the pork shoulder and chickpea puree and roasted vegetables. We ordered the papardelle pasta and it was good, but it had lemon peel in it, which at first made us think it was gristle. Advice to the chef: Perhaps try lemon zest so it doesn't scare people. :) It tasted amazing, though. The pistachio pot de creme was great. My cocktail (The Cobbler) was perfect if you like sweeter drinks.Service: Amazing.We'll for sure be back!P.S. The one weird thing to note is that the bathroom light fades off after a few minutes. If you move slightly, you're fine, but in case you're in there for awhile sitting still, you may be a little caught off guard. :)",40,"Washington, DC",Nido,Austin G.,"Washington, DC",2026272815,/biz/nido-washington-2
5.0,5.0,"I know this place will come onto your radar eventually.... I know, you will google map it and be like me: WHAT???!! Where?! How do I get that ... far? But you will bookmark it 'for future reference' and one Friday night will decide to give it a try.So, the said Friday. By now, you are about 4 blocks away from the district border line, $15 deep into the adventure (thanks, Uber!), observing the neighborhood you have never seen before - leaving the Ivy City, Brentwood and Brookland in the dust. Not to worry: that is the wisest investment you have made in a while - paid back in an unbelievable flavor, not-so-small share plates, delicious drink menu and super amicable staff that makes every effort to turn your dinner into an experience. I am not sure where to start and where to end. After having visited so many new, trendy, DC standard priced, small plates, over advertised and notorious places that are just trying too hard to be something - I see your skepticism - but give Nido a try! Simple, clean decor lines, reminiscent of Spanish or Italian coast line, spacious setting, muted music in the background and slightly modest, attentive, disciplined staff who seems really to care about what you eat, what you like, how you feel and how to make it even better. The menu is a celebration - causing you to pause and enjoy your time - luckily there is not yet a line outside the door hugging the block. The first dish comes out, full of smoky flavor, textures, surprise elements, a few sweet undertones. Second - gosh, the garnish, the sauce drops, al dente pasta, crispy mushrooms - all makes such an amazing balance. Third... you got the idea. And the portions are not shy - for the price of a small appetizer plate elsewhere in the district. After all you decide to go for dessert - yet another perfect, moist, bold piece. At the end, sipping your cocktails, people watching and having a pleasant talk, you kind of wish you could re-experience this over and over again.",40,"Washington, DC",Nido,Katya H.,"Washington, DC",2026272815,/biz/nido-washington-2

The octopus was a tad too hard/chewy and the pappardelle, while very tasty, was a bit too rich and thick for my preference.

5.0,4.0,"I had the pleasure of going to Nido last night for a small company dinner. The shear fact that Nido looks completely out of place made me very intrigued and once I looked up the menu I knew I had to go, so I was definitely excited for this dinner. Upon arriving I saw my group at the bar sipping cocktails and waiting for the table. The bartender was very friendly and asked if I would like anything to drink right away. I decided to go with a bamboo cocktail and was delivered a classy pink concoction with two green olives skewered on a bamboo toothpick. Unfortunately I cannot tell you what exactly was in it, but it was delicious and the bartender even made sure I liked it after trying it. After a little longer we were finally told our table was ready and were sat in the back corner. Imediately we ordered some snacks to share, as we were all starving; we started off with the following: Stuffed Grape Leaves, Sicilian Chickpea Puree, Blistered Shishito Peppers, House Made Whole Milk Ricotta and Smoked Trout Rillette Crostini. Food came out rather quickly as it was prepared and everything was delicious. My personal favorites were the House Made Ricotta and Shishito Peppers. Least favorite being the Stuffed Grape Leaves because I wasn't the biggest fan of the chicken liver.Next we ordered small plates to share. Again, everything came out as it was prepared and everything was delicious. The dishes we tried included the Hierloom Tomato, Tomatillo & Corn Salad, Braised Pork Shoulder, Grilled Octopus and Papardelle. The salad was perfectly dressed, incredibly flavorful and fresh. The pork shoulder had an amazing sauce and was filling paired with the patatas bravas. The octopus was not chewy at all and was just even better with the chorizo and beans and the papardelle was true homemade pasta with love!Between the four of us we all ate well, enjoyed what we had and were able to have a wonderful dinner due to a pleasant atmosphere. Nido gets a 5 for food but I had to knock them down to 4 for service, unfortunately it took awhile to order additional food/drinks when the restaurant is extremely small.",40,"Washington, DC",Nido,Jennifer W.,"Washington, DC",2026272815,/biz/nido-washington-2

5.0,5.0,"Wonderful addition to the neighborhood.  This was like stepping through a portal and ending up at a bright, super-hip spot in Spain. Beautiful space, but more importantly a tasty place. My husband and I had the house made whole milk ricotta, it was to-die-for.  I heard the waitress offer it as a dessert with grilled nectarines - if they have that next time I go, I'm getting that.  The spanish style stuffed grape leaves were perfect.  We enjoyed the aged beef carpaccio, an unusual treat that is not typical on DC menus.  The blistered shishito peppers took us back to our trip to barcelona, a simple dish, but lovely flavors to accompany other plates. Our favorite was the braised pork shoulder over the patatas bravas.  I can't wait to go back to try the pastas and oh-my the tuscan style bone-in sirloin looks amazing.  The menu is small, but offers a solid line-up of wonderful dishes.  Everything we had was delicious.  Also, the drink menu is great, from the cava to the house rose, I can't complain.  AND Vermouth on tap...perfect.  We were there on opening night, so that staff was still trying to gel, but overall the service was nice.  This is a great spot to hang out at the bar with friends or to sit down for a nice meal.  Feeling so lucky that they landed in Woodridge!!!",40,"Washington, DC",Nido,Marianne D.,"Washington, DC",2026272815,/biz/nido-washington-2

5.0,5.0,"My partner and I always walk into a newly opened restaurant expecting some shortcomings. Following this dining experience it is clear that Nido is run by true restaurant professionals, who have avoided many of the pitfalls of new restaurants. And now for the food.The ricotta appetizer was astounding and served with excellent bread. The mixed vegetables were very nice as well, but the restaurant's true strength lay in its seafood. The white anchovies appetizer and the octopus small plate anchored the meal in my opinion. The former presenting a flavorful elegantly presented light fare, while the latter provided a heartier and perfectly grilled option. The patatas bravas were crisp and far more flavorful than other tapas restaurants. Shishito peppers have always been a favorite of ours and the addition of Manchego really brought the main course home.Dessert was balanced between a light lime sorbet and a pistachio pot de creme. Both were excellent. The cocktails, wine and draught list were all well manicured. They even have local DC Rose vermouth on tap!Finally the restaurant ambiance presented an excellent environment for conversation. There's no TV and the music was used solely as background music. The skylight, large windows and gorgeous tiling allow for a bright and enjoyable meal in a relatively small space.

The staff were very accommodating of our baby, which was really nice. There was another baby at the bar as well. We checked out the downstairs space too -- there's another bar down there as well as more tables and it has a cozier feel. Both upstairs and downstairs are beautifully decorated and have a ""collected"" kind of feel without being overbearing because of all the white and light. More importantly: the food and drink. We started with the vermouth they have on tap from Capitoline, a local distiller. Delicious! My husband also had a cocktail and glass of wine from their unique and impressive lists -- both were great. The food comes in a range of small, medium and larger sized plates and is generally Mediterranean in style. Our favorites were the ricotta and bread, grilled octopus with chorizo and gigante beans, and the pappardelle pasta with pork and a surprising but delicious lemon flavor. Seriously, everything was delicious -- as good or better than food you would get at many places downtown.

It's a great place to meet up with friends that you haven't seen in a while and have a good talk over small plates and drinks (they have vermouth on tap and it's pretty delicious).,40,"Washington, DC",Nido,Scott B.,"Washington, DC",2026272815,/biz/nido-washington-2
5.0,5.0,"What a lovely little gem of a bar/restaurant! Definitely worth the trip, a little off the beaten path.  Gorgeous interior, and a relaxed but sophisticated vibe. Our dinner plates were satisfying and full of flavors. The bar served delicious cocktails with ingredients in pretty bottles with names I'd never heard of, without the nutty 14th and U Street surcharge. Friendly service. I really hope Nido makes it, despite the off-side location.",40,"Washington, DC",Nido,Sara L.,"Washington, DC",2026272815,/biz/nido-washington-2

5.0,5.0,"My wife and I have been there multiple times, we live in the  neighborhood, and love Nido. The grilled octopus, basque seafood stew, salads, bar (including wine selection) make for a thoroughly enjoyable dining experience. The decor and staff only add to the evening.

5.0,5.0,"I've eaten here twice and each time it was wonderful.  Their pistachio dessert is one of the best desserts I've ever had.   Their pastas are delicious, their small plates are large, and the anchovies snack is just perfect.  The decor is very bright and welcoming.  All in all, it's the NE analog to the Red Hen: a relatively inexpensive fine dining experience in the heart of a neighborhood run by people who are clearly passionate about the food/drink/experience.",40,"Washington, DC",Nido,Nicholas S.,"Washington, DC",2026272815,/biz/nido-washington-2
5.0,5.0,"My husband and I went with our six month old daughter to nido last night and loved it.  We ordered the ricotta, patatas (the sauce was amazing), the chicken (pickled lemon, yum!), and the cod.  Everything was delicious.  We also got the pasta with the squid - the pasta was well made, but we didn't love the flavors.  The decor is really lovely and the service was laid back and attentive.  We also ordered a glass of wine/cocktail each and it came to under 90 bucks with tip.  Like all Brookland restaurants, we felt very comfortable with our baby there, but this is also a great date night spot.  It would do well anywhere in the city - it's that great.  We will definitely be back many times.",40,"Washington, DC",Nido,Lisa P.,"Washington, DC",2026272815,/biz/nido-washington-2
5.0,5.0,"We loved Nido--the food, the drinks, the atmosphere. The downstairs dining room and bar is cozy and stylish. Nice mix of seafood, meat and veggie options. The pork shoulder should not be missed (the octopus was a close second). We made a meal of small plates but next time will try the large plates--all are meant to be shared. I'm kicking myself for not trying the seafood stew. Note that they are happy to have large groups and kids (we were 7 plus a baby and they rearranged tables without missing a beat) but the place feels like a grownup and intimate retreat.

5.0,5.0,"First impressions matter, and from the moment I walked in, this place raised my hopes, then delivered. The hosts were cool and NICE (can you believe it?). The rest of the evening reflected that same care and attention. The food? Well, I couldn't stop myself from moaning out loud. Kind of embarrassing, but what can you do? The cocktails were delicious and fresh (both in terms of ingredients and recipes). And I agree with other reviewers that you could spend whole nights here, wonder where the time has gone, and yet have one of the best nights in recent memory.

4.0,4.0,"Barrel has a great set up. They have a nice long bar with ample seating, and have many tables to dine at as well. On a nice day you can sit outside on their front patio along Pennsylvania Avenue. They seem to attract a diverse crowd, especially that it is one of the only gastro pub style bars in the southeast area. They have an extensive list of bourbon, craft cocktails and craft beers. They switch their beers quite often, which means they run out pretty fast of their kegs but it's fun to check out what they are currently serving. The bartenders are knowledgeable and craft very delicious cocktails, they will make you just about anything using fresh ingredients even if it's not on their menu. The have a smaller menu with many delicious items to choose from. You could come here for dinner or just an appetizer and find something satisfying. The Brussels sprouts are a must try as they are perfectly prepared and extremely delicious! Barrel is a great place to come if you are looking for a delicious drink or to grab a bite and have good conversation. If you are looking for a bar to dance at or to get extremely drunk at, this isn't your place. It isn't your typical rowdy weekend bar.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Sam S.,"Washington, DC",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington
4.0,2.0,"Meh. Service was pretty awful. Server came by and introduced herself, but even though we were ready to order, she disappeared. We ordered with a different server who noticed we had been waiting for awhile.I was very impressed by the flavor of the brisket. Wonderful - truly. I was extremely dissatisfied by the collard greens, which were more salt than anything, and the beans, which were hard.A great selection of draft beer, but brown ""water"" is overpriced. Sorry - but it's expensive for even a night on Cap Hill. I'll take my BBQ and Rye needs elsewhere.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,M L.,"Washington, DC",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington
4.0,4.0,"Four and a half stars. Now that Chris is tending bar elsewhere, Ruairi is my new favorite gent behind Barrel's bar. Already getting crowded with the after-work traffic, so as a date night spot it can be hit or miss. Barely any signal in the smaller downstairs bar where the Elixir lights point.It's a shame they ran out of the milk punch, but even with the warmer season they had enough signature cocktails to cater to my palate. Cocktail pours are good: The Bucket was as tasty as the Last Resort, and even the Charleston Bamboo hit the right notes. Brown water pricing is on par with DC standards set by other bars with similarly invested inventory. Signage lets you know what's ahead on the barrel-aged schedule.Food is pretty solid too, if a skosh steep on price point. Sticky buns use more Asian-style BBQ with Carolina-inspired sauce, and are a decent appetizer to split. I was more a fan of the fonduta stuffed gnocchi, perfectly seasoned and seared with crisped lardons, shredded rabbit, and enough fennel to barely sweeten. We'll be back to imbibe more craft drinks over: tagliatelle alla carbonara; fried chicken, fried scallops, smoked brisket, wild boar pappardelle.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Ruth C.,"Washington, DC",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington
4.0,4.0,Best selection of whiskey I've seen anywhere. Particularly strong on American styles. Friendly knowledgable bartender. Great craft cocktails. I'd definitely give it another try. Didn't sample any food.,228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Jason W.,"East Amherst, NY",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington

4.0,5.0,"I really, really like Barrel. Let's start with the fact that it's primarily a whiskey bar, which as a Texas transplant is completely my jam.The menu features an entire list of ""Brown Water"" that is double-sided and filled to the brim with selection. Every rye I adore? Check. Every Bourbon Gina-approved? Check.  Barrel-aged house-made caskets of cocktails? Double-check. Letting me sniff bottles to decide which delicious brown water I was going to sample? Class, y'all. Letting me check out the downstairs high-end whiskey stash that's normally under lock and key? Waaaaat? Yes please.Clearly, staff is phenomenal here. Rachelle, my bartender, was such a hoot that I demanded she and I become friends. She's the one rocking granny-hair with a vengeance. The manager (I wish I could remember his name, sorry dude!) was equally hilarious and both just clearly were having a damn good time.Overall, anytime I'm in this neck of the woods this will be my spot. Well done, Barrel!",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Gina C.,"Arlington, VA",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington
4.0,5.0,"So, here's the thing about Barrel: Even if you are no-class simpleton like myself with paper-thin (at best) knowledge of Bourbon, you can be guaranteed that you are in for a treat - especially if you've just picked up some weird whiskey craving after watching old re-runs of Deadwood.  Thankfully I always come to Barrel with a steady flow of people know their stuff and recommend some really good bourbon and whiskey drinks (God forbid I might actually learn a thing or two) however all of the bartenders seem to be spot-on in their recommendations as well and they are shockingly really friendly about it too.  To accompany that is a very simple idiot-proof menu (for people like me) that gives vivid descriptions of the specialty whiskeys along with excellent cocktails for that particular period of time - they all sound good but most of them can easily surpass $15 per drink territory so beware.In terms of the food, Barrel trades in southern comfort food - very broad term that covers a massive expanse of geography - but what the fuck to I care, right?  This cuisine is literally among my favorite and Barrel offers an elevated version of it.  You don't even have to be into whiskey (or drinking in general) in order to enjoy Barrel so don't let that whole 'bourbon bar' thing intimidate you.  Try to make it for happy hour because if you are like me and just want to eat everything in front of you, the specials are anywhere between $5 to $6 - unbeatable.  I really enjoyed the duck prosciutto with plenty of crisp bread, assorted pickles, and jamb.  These dishes are small - so be prepared to order a few - try the mac n' cheese and gnocchi - excellent takes on them as well as the venison sausage.  For dinner, I found the fried chicken with orange zest accompanied by a heavenly biscuit and blood-orange jam to be one of the most delicious things I've tried in a very long time.  Others in my group ordered a delicious softshell crab and grits dish along with an oil-drenched tuna sandwich which was just out of sight. For something very warming, also try the lobster with saffron citrus broth with cuttlefish and noodles, it's the perfect kind of seafood dish that you crave.  These dishes alone literally make you want to keep coming back over and over and if I become broke, I'd be glad to say it was all because I've stuffed my face with the fried chicken and biscuits at Barrel.A mere blocks away from Capitol Hill and congress, the rich bourbon-colored interiors with accents of exposed brick  and walnut wood make Barrel are a good-mood-setter especially during the winter or any other rainy day not only for local people on the Hill but also for out-of-towners to discover.  However, the summer months also offer a panoply of brilliant and ice-cold cocktails so always keep this winner of a restaurant in mind at all seasons and at all times.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Ahmed K.,"Washington, DC",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington

4.0,4.0,"After a road trip from Austin to DC, my friends and I were looking for something to get cleaned up for. Good drinks and good food, Barrel delivered. We arrived around 8pm on a Friday night and the place was packed and loud. The guy at the door was confusing, we thought he was just hanging out having a drink near the front - he stared at us for a few minutes before directing us to a table that was open.I was a little apprehensive of the pricing versus portions, but after having the ragu, left stuffed. They serve the pasta in a tiny looking bowl, but give you more than enough to feel satisfied. The ragu, mac and cheese, and brussels sprouts were all top notch (this mac and cheese lover says do the ragu). They have an ample selection of libations from beer to cider to cocktails. The waitstaff is a little chaotic/slow;  there was confusion on our brussels sprout delivery and on-tap drinks arrived with our food. The atmosphere was comfortable but it was difficult to hold a four way conversation due to the noise. They have a few smaller flat screens around the bar, playing sportsball, and the bar is the focus of the place. We ended up noshing fairly efficiently and heading out. Overall...I would head back during a not so crazy day/time. Food is worth it.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Kimberlee A.,"Austin, TX",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington
4.0,3.0,"It is misleading that this place is coined as a ""gastropub"" on yelp. Once we got settled in, it is really just a bar, specifically a bourbon bar. That is totally fine but where that created a problem for me is that although it has a decent selection of beers, the bartender was completely clueless about beer. She did not know where things were brewed or even able to give recommendations. I suggest that this place adds the brewery locations of their beers to the menu! Had a few drinks here before a Nationals game and also decided to grab some food. We ordered their burger and asked for no mayo on the burger. The bartender gave it to us and immediately recognized that they put the mayo on the burger and asked if we wanted them to remake it. It was a tough spot because in my experience, most places immediately jump right into correcting the order without giving you the option. I honestly hate having the pressure put on me to decide because it makes me think the kitchen would be annoyed by having to remake it. The ambiance is nice and the decor is adorable. Besides not having a lot of knowledge of beer, the bartender was at least very sweet. If I was in the mood for some happy hour small bites and some bourbon, this place would be a clear winner for me.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Misty F.,"Las Vegas, NV",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington
4.0,2.0,"Went here for brunch. I got the general sense that they just didn't have it together. No sign or person to tell us it was okay to seat ourselves, menus weren't printed yet, no silverware, they gave us cream for our coffee in a shot glass, sugar in some shared open contained with little pieces of debris in it, etc. I got the gnocchi, and the portion was way too small for a $16 plate! There were only 6 gnocchi on there, the lardons were half burnt, the mornay sauce was watery and bland. Not good at all. Maybe we got them on a bad day but I don't see myself coming back anytime soon.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Ryan S.,"Silver Spring, MD",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington
4.0,3.0,"I think I would like this place more if I came for dinner, but we just did happy hour. Their happy hour selections are extrmely limited. Three food choices, one beer, one whisky, and one cocktail. The beer was a naragamsett lager, on par with a miller lite, so even at $5 it's not really a deal. The food option we tried, however, was delectable. We had the biscuit with ham and honey butter. This thing was so gooey and buttery, one of the best biscuits I have ever had. Perfect crust on the outside while soft on the inside. Great work.They have a looong bar, which I love because you can find space without fighting, with nice dim lighting, but TVs above the bar showing espn, so it's not schmancy decor. They lose one bonus point because service was extremely slow. We sat a good 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us and gave us menus (despite people walking by and us trying to get their attention), and then almost 10 minutes before someone came to take our drink orders.To their credit they did have goose island bourbon county stout on the menu (the elixir of the gods), and they have a whisky menu titled ""brown water."" I was on a happy hour only mission this day, though, so they will have to wait for another time.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Dan M.,"Washington, DC",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington
4.0,5.0,"A friend visited me from out of town this past weekend and we decided to head to Barrel in Eastern Market for brunch when she first arrived from Union Station.  We loved Barrel!  Such a great vibe.  It's not pretentious, the service is excellent, and the food is delish and you get the bang for your buck!  Oh, and those drinks were superb.What we ordered:-Drinks: I ordered the Champagne Supernova cocktail (with cava, sorel, orange juice, burlesque bitters, and brown sugar) and my friend ordered a mimosa.  Both were amazing.  My cocktail seriously knocked my socks off.  -Entrees: I ordered the Croque Madame (house-smoked ham and mornay sauce).  I absolutely loved it!  It wasn't your typical Croque Madame sandwich.  Rather, it was two pieces of bread with ham and cheese sauce smothered all over them.  It was like an explosion of flavors in my mouth and I absolutely loved it.  My friend ordered a special grits with pork.  She loved hers as well.From start to finish, our meal was excellent.  Plenty of room to sit, the restaurant certainly didn't try too hard and was not an over-priced brunch place as many restaurants are in the DC area.  Service was friendly and efficient, and we had an all-around great time.  Awesome brunch place if you're in the Eastern Market area!",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Pegah Y.,"Washington, DC",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington
4.0,4.0,"You won't be disappointed if you go here.  Solid Establishment.I hate the term ""Gastropub""... because it suggests that other bars should be given a pass for serving shitty food.  Barrel serves pub food that has been elevated.  You pay a fair premium for this elevation, and you leave satisfied.  There are lots of places that do this... and Barrel does it well.   I love bourbon... and they have Bourbon.  Many Bourbons.  Their house drinks are imaginative, and the bar staff are capable.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Eric R.,"Washington, DC",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington
4.0,5.0,"I had a great time here last night. A group of us came last night for an Unofficial  Yelp Event - Yelpers' Happy Hour.I was the first one to arrive, and I asked Ruari (pronounced Rory) the bartender to fix me up something to help with my head cold. My first initial thought  is to get a hot totty, but he said he had a better idea -- I let him create his art. He came back with a different take on a hot totty. His drink had hot water, port, and an orange slice with cloves in it. It for sure did do the trick in clearing me up for a little bit. My friends would tell you otherwise, but I noticed the difference. We had the opportunity to try a different variety of items. Everyone ordered their own dinner, but Barrel so nicely provided us a couple of free appetizers -- specifically -- brussel sprouts and their take on hot wings. I hate brussel sprouts. WITH. A. PASSION! I have to admit though this was probably my favorite we tried. Other items I liked was the Carolina sticky buns, and my ham and biscuits. Their biscuits in itself are something to write home about. As far as the ham -- it is a healthy portion of prosciutto served with a side of jammy like butter. I ordered the ham and biscuits from their $5 happy hour menu.As far as the their hot wings - are made with a Thai chili spice that really gives you a good kick in the mouth with how spicy they are. Spice lovers will appreciate this dish. It isn't your run of the mill buffalo sauce.... it is not buffalo sauce at all to be exact.The happy hour is kickin'. $5-6 apps and $5 drinks. You can't really beat that in my book. Happy hour sizes are small, but that is to be expected with happy hour. Next time I will just opt for a full meal. Their entrees are reasonably priced with stuff priced under $20 for most items. Sam was our downstairs bartender and server. She was pleasant, and well rounded making sure we had what we needed when we needed it.Upstairs is more sporty with televisions, bar seating, and table seating and a bit louder than the dimly lit downstairs. Downstairs is definitely like being the cellar. I am not a huge fan of being in any basement or dimly lit cellar, but for this particular place -- like my less desired taste for brussel sprouts -- this is easily the exception where I was okay being in a cellar. I really appreciated Mike the GM, and Ruairi stopping by to see if we were enjoying ourselves and hearing our feedback. That alone shows how much pride they have in their establishment and why I give this easily 5 stars. One last thing before I close this out -- with me being sick, I didn't truly get the absolute experience I had expectations for to try their whisky and bourbon menus. That is a must do, and I will make it back when I am well enough to take it. There are too many fantastic options to be left untasted!",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Mary Kate M.,"Washington, DC",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington
4.0,4.0,"Came in while in the neighborhood on Saturday night and got some amazing drinks. I had been looking for an opportunity to try this place after seeing all the great reviews, and I have to say, it definitely lived up to my high expectations. I tried two cocktails--the Milk Punch and the Americano--and both were awesome in their own completely different ways. I have to knock a star off for the service, which was a little slow given the number of customers in the upstairs bar. It wasn't completely dead but not all the seats at the bar were filled, with only a few customers at tables, so I would've liked to have a bit more attentive service. But other than that, this is an amazing place to get a drink.

But from my various visits, I've enjoyed enough of their cocktails, snacked on plenty of appetizers, and had plenty of good times to say that Barrel is a great place to hangout. With outdoor seating, a long bar where you can either just grab a drink or get a full meal, plenty of seating upstairs, and a second bar and seating area downstairs, Barrel can probably satisfy whatever type of ambiance you're looking for. I can't remember all the various appetizers I've had, but know I've never thought any of the dishes was worth complaining or raving about. So essentially, good enough.

4.0,3.0,"This place was listed as a Gastropub. Seems to be a new thing now so I had some expectations higher for this place. For the food, it was better than I had expected. I saw they had foie gras on the menu. I'll never get that at a a bar, but I did get a truffle cheeseburger and asked for the mayo on the side. The burger was great, the truffle cheese was delicious. The bartender, she forgot to get the mayo on the side but it didn't hurt in the end. Girlfriend got the Carolina BBQ pork sliders with coleslaw since it was happy hour and they were 2 for $6. These weren't as good. Disappointed with the amount of pork on the steamed bun and too much coleslaw. The coleslaw wasn't terrible but I've had better. Still, the food was better than I had expected. I was just more disappointed with the bartenders knowledge. When I hear Gastropub and with craft beer being on the menu, I would expect the bartender to have some knowledge about the brews. The bartender didn't know where any of the beers were brewed and didn't know much about breweries in DC. This was disappointing. It appears that the place is more of a whiskey place but if she didn't know about where beers are brewed, it wouldn't give me a lot of hope to know what makes particular whiskeys good. The upside is that the place is really clean and modern. I especially enjoyed the lighted BAR sign on the far wall. This Gastropub had some good food choices but disappointed with the bartender knowledge.

4.0,3.0,"Being generous with this review, it's a 2.5 in reality and I can't justify giving it jus a 2.0. Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon, hoping for a beer or cocktail to drive away the August heat. This makes the second time I've been, the first was a few months ago on a weekend evening. Very different crowd now, sparse but lively, a good place for an afternoon drink when it comes to the crowd. Starting off with the positives. The space is really great. Lots of brick and wood, but still rather modern. Chalkboard menus for the adequate beer list. The paper lists for beer arrange it by style, which is a sold plus. The whiskey list is pretty great. Not as mind boggling long as some places, but a very respectable mix. Good cocktails, too. I've not eaten here yet, but what food they have seems like it'd be good. Now for the negative. There are only two, but they stood out so much it kind of killed it for me. First, the menu is extremely limited. They don't really have any small plates that would be good for a couple of friends or a date to share over a drink. They're limited to a small charcuterie selection (4 items) and fries. That's it. And the charcuterie is pretty over priced. That brings me to the next issue: prices. It's expensive, even by Capitol Hill/Barracks Row standards. The beer is two to three dollars more expensive per glass than it should be, and the whiskey ranges from slightly over priced ($14 for Basil Haydens) to inexcusable ($47 for Laphroaig 18).If they review their price structure and give some options for bar food, I'd recommend this place in a heartbeat. Until then, though, I have to say pass on it.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Nathan F.,"Arlington, VA",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington
4.0,4.0,"Came for the Bourbon, stayed for the food.  The bourbon selection here is top notch, with a lot of smaller distilleries listed and their prices for the most part I found reasonable.  Really enjoyed seeing bourbons and whiskeys from all around the US, and it was fun trying them.  Thankfully my cousin and I have a decent knowledge of bourbons, because while our server was nice, he wasn't very knowledgeable about the different bourbons we got.Food wise, the fried chicken was cooked perfectly, and the pasta dish with the rabbit carnitas was also delicious.  Sadly the appetizer bbq pork buns were a big let down.  The slaw on them was way to wet which caused the buns to become soaked and also took away from the good bbq flavor.  That was the only ""poor"" part of the meal.  I would happily go back to continue trying their large selection of bourbons.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Randal R.,"Washington, DC",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington
4.0,3.0,"The food is good, but it's very overpriced for the portions. Even by hill standards. The mac n cheese ($9) is good but somewhat bland for the variety of cheeses included. I also ordered the Carolina BBQ sliders. Way way way overpriced. $12 for three mini ""sliders"" - yes they taste good but they're not special enough to justify the price:product ratio.

4.0,5.0,"This is the very first place we ate at upon arrival to DC. I insisted on walking from the Library of Congress despite the 70% humidity and 97 degree heat (what was I thinking?!) so by the time my husband and I arrived we were groggy from our red eye flight and seriously cranky from exhaustion and hunger. Well wasn't this place worth the journey! We sat at the bar and immediately received ice cold waters. We ordered happy hour pork bun sliders (delicious) and the Best. Burger. Ever. Seriously. The burger here is magic. I still think about it. The bartender told us they grind their own meats so maybe that's the magic? The grilled bun and the sauce don't hurt either. Just don't let the size fool you-this burger is dense and packed with flavor! My husband was thrilled and he's athletic with a hearty appetite. This bar reminds me of a smoky (sans the actual fumes) Southern/Midwestern melange lounge that's just the right amount of dim with excellent cocktails and real gritty yet elevated food. We even went back for brunch but our friends really wanted lunch so we ended up only having cocktails and moving on. However, the cocktails were splendid-I had the champagne supernova. My husband had a strong whiskey drink of sorts-forgetting the name, also excellent. So if you're looking for a place near Eastern Market metro that lets you marinate in the dark cold away from the heat and quickness of the city, do yourself a flavor and slow down to eat, drink and be merry here.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Ryn S.,"Long Beach, CA",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington

Like any cellar, it's chilly down there, but worth the goose bumps. The list of bourbon is never ending. Our bartender was so helpful and friendly, she made our night. I especially loved her snarky jokes (she's pregnant and told me she didn't like cocktails, but isn't really drinking much of anything these days). Also had the Cuba libre, sooooo good.

Unfortunately, after really enjoying the biscuits small plate, I found a hair on the bottom of my plate. They took it off my bill, but still it left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth since I already ate it all. However, I'll focus on the good part. The two biscuits were huge and something my friend and I agreed we should've shared rather than ordering our own. The burnt honey butter was to die for. I was just eating the butter at one point. The combo of the soft, warm biscuits, with the sweetness of the honey butter and the saltiness of the ham (well, prosciutto, really) was so good.The Champagne Supernova cocktail sponsored by Oasis* was a pretty delicious concoction of cava, OJ, bitters and brown sugar.I didn't make the hair thing a big deal, so for them to take it off without me asking was a nice gesture.*not verified, so don't go crazy.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Esther G.,"Sterling Heights, MI",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington

4.0,4.0,"We came in on a whim on a cold spring Saturday evening. My wife and I were post brewfest and needed to warm up with some lite bites and stiff drinks to warm our bones before dinner. We sat at the bar with a bartender that was attentive, nice and welcoming. Our experience overall was fantastic.The bar and surrounding dining area of well-designed and a place that makes you feel comfortable. A rustic at home kind of vibe. Downstairs they have another specialty bar which were only ventured to peek at. They specialize in whiskey and cask cocktails. On hindsight I should have gone for the cocktails and so should you! I am on a bender of Sculpin by Ballast Point Brewing and when I saw it on tap I couldn't resist. We ordered two appetizers. The foie gras and sausage. Very different flavors for similar dishes served with bread. The sausage had a smokiness that I had not experienced before and the honey paired with the foie gras was an added touch I could not have thought up.

4.0,5.0,"My first experience with Barrel will not be my last. My dinner dates and I walked in on the later side of a Saturday evening expecting to have a long wait since the upstairs tables are first come first serve. Surprisingly, we were able to sit right away. The vibe inside matches the storefront, which I happen to love. The Barrel sign makes me happy whenever I drive past it, am I the only one? Service was great, but of course, the highlights were the food & drink. We loved the Carolina BBQ steam buns as an appetizer (perfect for three people--there were three on the plate), and each entree was unique and tasty. My ONLY disappointment--and it is a big one--is that Barrel was out of what I really wanted to order, the wild boar pappardelle. Apparently that happens often since it is one of the most popular things on the menu. I was consoled hearing that due to its popularity that dish never disappears, whereas most other menu items rotate seasonally. Maybe that's how they get people to come back?

This place for the bill, nuisances of an olde time saloon with the modern flair of an upscale Americana bar...Staff was friendly, welcoming, and interactive... The small things really do matter.The whiskey and bourbon list is impressive, the cocktails were generously heavy handed but extremely well balanced. Our visit was graced with a visit from the head chef who brought us a dessert on the house for simply being out and about on the town and chatting with the staff!The dessert was creative, fun and packed with big flavored. Aperitif macerated berries with a house made shortbread covered in pop rocks and basil sugar?!?

4.0,4.0,"Another UYE outing hosted by Super Yelper Mary K. featuring Barrel this go around. Appropriately named when you think about Whiskey Barrels which you will find throughout the lower level. Attending Yelp events are a great way to try out places that you have never thought about visiting or even yet, never knew existed. Barrel is a BAR that just so happens to serve a limited Southern Cuisine menu for those who need a little something in their belly when they're getting their drink on! This place is interesting. It's dark, with ample dining tables upstairs and a rather large bar. The bar area does have flat screen TV's for the sports enthusiasts! Downstairs is somewhat spooky and cellar like. I take that back, it is a freakin cellar, with tables and a bar. Very low ceilings and you need the light from your cellphone to see the menu. That being said, it's pretty cool. Nothing I'd want to experience all the time but definitely every now and then. Now to the food. Again, this is a bar that happens to serve food, thus the menu is EXTREMELY limited. What we did have was quite tasty. We were here during happy hour, so the price was right!!!  I had the Confit Chicken served with toasted french bread. Unique and again, very tasty! It was similar to a very spicy chicken cole slaw salad. The Carolina BBQ pork sticky buns were bite sized little sandwiches that everyone at our table thoroughly enjoyed. Toya J. had the fried chicken dish. It looked amazing but she said the taste did not live up to the looks. Man, I hate when that happens!! She couldn't put her finger on it but it was missing a little something.Management realized that we were esteemed Yelpers and provided a very large bowl of complimentary Brussel Sprouts and a tray of Thai chili wings. I've never been a huge fan of Brussel Sprouts so it took a lot of coaxing from Tracy N. before I finally gave in. WOW, these things were outstanding. Hands down, my favorite dish here. Like she said, they could have been a meal all their own. The wings were good, not very good but good. Nothing to write home about. Service was excellent and just reminiscing about the evening and what Barrel is, I bumped up my initial rating from a 3 to a 4 Star. This place treated us great and I will definitely return in the very near future.

However, I was definitely proved wrong! A group of 6 of us came in on a Sunday afternoon after a very boozy brunch to continue day drinking. Our waitress came over almost immediately to help us figure out what we wanted, which was more difficult than it sounds given that we had just come from bottomless brunch. I'm a big bourbon fan so I described what I liked and asked her to recommend something. She blew me away with her in depth specific knowledge of not only every cocktail but the bourbons as well. I ordered the Bucket and was so impressed by the flavors and the nifty ice sphere. It was just the right blend of bourbon and ginger without being too spicy or too sweet. Our waitress kept coming back and checking on us regularly and was so nice and patient with us.

They use lots of made in house bitters and syrups, that is what set these drinks aside from the pack. With that said the prices reflect what your getting in a quality cocktail.The place is a bit tight and loud and if your downstairs the head is upstairs which can be a small pain.

4.0,5.0,"Lets just get this out of the way before anything else. Barrel is exceptional. It has the best bar food I've ever had in my life, and that same ""bar food"" (it feels like a disservice to call it bar food) is better than many, many other restaurants offerings that I've had over the years. We started with a couple Bucket cocktails. Great drinks. Used some really good bourbon to make a drink that reminded me of a sweeter Manhattan. Served with a baseball sized circular ice cube!First up were the pork sticky buns which were just as good as all the other reviews on Yelp have said. The sticky bun bread is warm and chewy and sweet. If they served that bread alone with some butter and honey they could honestly sell it as dessert. The slaw and BBQ are both tangy and delicious, but the sticky buns stole the show for me. The fried chicken is something I haven't seen discussed much in reviews here, and that really surprises me. This is some of the best fried chicken I have had anywhere. Served immediately out of the fryer and on to the plate, it was literally dripping with flavor. Juicy, succulent, and hot as hell, this is what KFC and all other chicken places should aim to have their chicken taste like. I wish I could describe it better. But you really just have to try it. It is fried chicken on steroids.That awesome fried chicken also came with a biscuit topped with some apple jam that also could also be served by itself as a dessert or app. Biting into that biscuit was buttery heaven. The sweet jam complemented the heat of the chicken perfectly. We ended with a couple bourbons. The bourbon list here (as others have noted) is extensive. If you like bourbon or are just at all interested in trying some for the first time, this is a great place to do it. The bartenders we interacted with and ordered from were all friendly and helpful and were more than willing to recommend drinks for us, all while working a busy Friday night. I had the Pritchard Chocolate which had wonderful cocoa notes in the nose and finish. Great winter drink! Finally, some good and bad.Great:-Exceptional food. The fact that it's basically bar food makes it even more special. The food here rivals many end high end restaurants in the area. -One of the most extensive bourbon lists I've ever seen. If you like bourbon, they have something for you here. -Outstanding service. The recommendations were excellent, the food was brought out quickly on a busy Friday night, and all the bartenders were friendly and helpful.Bad:-Nothing.

The storefront has a sleek wooden panel look and stands out from the other surrounding little shops and restaurants. The inside is dark and has the same wooden panel look - I can see why it's a popular spot for nearby federal workers after work. As much as I wanted to try the brown water, the menu was pretty overwhelming. I stuck with the happy hour specials and got a $5 beer - they have a pretty good selection of beers and wine. The specials are not written down anywhere, so I imagine they change it up everyday but always run 4-7pm. They also had some appetizer specials, so I got the sticky buns. They were kind of small for the price (2 for $6) but absolutely delicious! I sat at the bar and had a friendly bartender and great service.

In addition, Barrel has some excellent intimate seating areas away from the bar. The menu is very manly, mostly meat type dishes and stuff that goes with whisky. But that didn't seem to affect the demographic. I really don't think you can go wrong at this place. It's just a nice bar.

I got a tuna sandwich. The filling inside of the bread was salty and had the perfect balance of acidity with the pickled onions. The bread was toasted extra crunchy and went so well with the tuna. They also give you a side of potato chips that I think are probably home made. They were crispy and had a garlicy taste. Definitely would recommend to you!Also, their pancakes are delicious! First of all, it is so beautifully plated. It had a big pile of sweet whip cream filling up almost half of the plate. The whip cream was infused with ginger and on top of the pancakes there was delicious sugared apples. The steak and eggs was good. There was a cheese sauce that came with it. I asked that they put the cheese sauce separately, but they forgot and put the sauce on my plate. I was drinking the night before, so the sauce seemed really gross to me. I would have just ate it if I wasn't feeling sick, but reminded the waitress and she was really sorry. The manager came out and apologized too! They had really good service.

4.0,4.0,"On our continuous quest to explore our neighborhood, we ventured into the Barrel last night. Upstairs was loud and crowded, so we dined downstairs. The good: - The pork belly sticky buns with a light slaw, sweet and tangy BBQ sauce was delicious! I thought the flavors in this dish was the most tame out of the other dishes that we tried. Nonetheless, everything worked really well together to satiate an appetite while offering a memorable dish. - The fried chicken over a biscuit and orange jam (sans gravy): the fried chicken was boneless, juicy and crispy. The buttery biscuit went great with the sweet, candied orange jam (or I think it was orange - it might have been tomatoes because it was too dark to make out what it was...) - The bartender was very engaging and friendly. We also got lucky with a stray mac n cheese dish that the restaurant gave to us on the house. The mac n cheese was just what the dish should be - creamy and cheesy for a cold, cold night. The questionable:- The brussel sprouts with fish sauce was WAY too salty. I think it had 2 or 3 more splashes of fish sauce than was necessary - the salt level was so severe that the insides of my mouth felt dehydrated as I was eating the brussel sprouts! The same goes for the gravy served under the fried chicken. - The dim lighting was a level beyond mood lighting as I could not see my food... my friend and I played a guessing game as to the color of some of our dishes (green, brown, yellow?).

There is a limited small plates menu that compliments the brown liquor cocktails.  The fried pork chop sandwich was tasty, but the baked beans are not to be missed !  I would get a pint to go!  Downstairs is a quieter more intimate space, to escape the Hill talk.  Bar is comfortable, but it does get busy and noisy.

I had a Manhattan that was right on point. I let the bartender mix it with her choice of whiskey. We seated downstairs which looked like a vintage wine room. It wasnt busy since we did come by on a Tuesday night.I would also recommend the food there. Especially the Brussels sprouts, which was mixed with fish sauce and honey. Ive been craving them all week now. We also had the bbq pork buns with coleslaw. They were also delicious. I do plan to visit again to have another good drink.

4.0,4.0,"This space just keeps getting nicer.  Believe it or not, the 18th Amendment was a step up from Zach's, the pool hall that used to occupy this space, and Barrel is an even bigger improvement over the 18th Amendment.  The upstairs bar retains its same serpentine shape, but finishes have been upgraded (wood, exposed brick, marble, etc).But I'm sure you're not coming here for the finishes.  You SHOULD be coming here for the whiskey and barrel aged drinks.  At last count there were 66 bourbons, 23 ryes, and 18 American/Tennessee whiskeys, plus the aforementioned barrel aged drinks.  The barrel aged Sazerac, made with Bulleit rye, Kubler absinthe, and Peychauds bitters, was fantastic.  And although this is a bourbon-centric establishment, don't overlook the Pendennis, another barrel-aged cocktail made with St. George's Terroir gin, Apricot Eau de Vie, Peychauds, and lime.All this aside, they also have a decent selection of beers.  There are 16 rotating taps that included Union Gose when I stopped by.  In the basement is another small bar called ""Elixir"" were behind a glass door you can see the barrels aging.  Frankly, my experience in Elixir wasn't as good as at the upstairs bar; I wasn't really impressed with my bartender's skills.  That being said, the overall experience was great.But what about the food, you ask.  Although I haven't eaten here, there is a short but ambitious; think rabbit carnitas and wild boar pappardelle plus BBQ.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Christopher C.,"Washington, DC",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington

The mix of the tart slaw with the slightly sweet gooey bun was a welcome surprise.For main, I ordered the scallops and fiancé ordered the meat loaf.The scallops. OMG the scallops. Perfectly seared and seasoned with fish oil and chili sauce while sitting on a bed of citrus give these scallops a balanced spicy yet fresh kick. I will dream about these scallops. I didn't try the meat loaf out of fear that the scallop taste would be sabotaged but fiancé assures me it was hearty and filling.

4.0,5.0,"A mix of good food, a long bourbon list, and excellent service makes this place worth the walk from the hill.Barrel is very much modeled after a speakeasy, with a rustic interior and lots of decoration around, surprise, barrels. There are two floors to the bar - the ground floor with the most seating and the basement which is a bit cozier. It's very cool a modern with a vintage feel that doesn't rub it in your face like other bars.The drink menu is long, long, long - if you like Bourbon you will love this place. We came during happy hour, and although they don't seem to have a permanent menu, the prices were quite reasonable - select draft beer are $5, they offer some mixed bourbon drinks for $5-7, and they have food on happy hour. The pork sticky buns are typically on happy hour, and although you only get two buns (pulled pork, coleslaw, on a sweet bun), it was really delicious and I highly recommend. They had a number of beers on draft, and I was thrilled they had mostly small domestic breweries such as Devil's Backbone (Virginia) and Victory (Philly). The service was also top-notch. Our server had all of the happy hour specials committed to memory and provided recommendations. Even as the place filled up (it gets packed after 6PM) he was still attentive.Overall, a nice addition to the Capitol Hill/Eastern Market bar scene, and I'm sure I'll be back to try more of the the 9292302 bourbons they have.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Cody Y.,"Philadelphia, PA",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington

The disappointing:My friend's second draft beer was a bit flat. He hadn't tried the beer before, so not sure if it was due to that type of beer, or due to the draft line.

It's IDEAL gourmet bar food. I also love the pork buns which are sweet and sticky and consistently good.  I've also had the pork pasta - which is very rich but not overcooked.  I think they only have one dessert - sticky toffee pudding - but it is utterly fantastic.

And their selection of food/snacks is awesome.The Barbecue Pork Sticky Buns are something to write home about! The bun itself is sweet corn, and the pork is delicious. It's really an ingenious invention.While their regular prices are a bit steep for a bar, their happy hour is awesome! Many food items and cocktails for 5 to 6 dollars. And they have a bourbon on HH too!On a personal note, I left my wallet (with my entire life's contents) here during happy hour and they kept it safe for me in the basement office!

I love the ""old west"" feel of this place, very saloon-like. I was there early (5 pm ish) but fortunately, I was able to get the last, lone biscuit from the biscuit menu. The waiter, worked with me and made recommendations because I wanted the ham biscuits from the brunch menu. Although they were not available he helped me make something gosh darned close. So I got the last biscuit and shhh.... it was better than my southern grandma's' delicious (please don't tell her, bless her heart), the honey butter and some thin sliced VA ham and mmm...hm.mmmm I was in heaven. They honey butter, don't yawn, when you go to Barrel, get it, put it on something or eat it with a spoon, it's. that. good. Trust me!I also had the NC pork bbq which would make any Tarheel proud, replete with 'slaw , so deliciously good. The flatbread was good too but not even close to the biscuits. For drinks, I had a whiskey sour with mint and it was quite good, well made. They also have a wide selection of beers on tap.

I ended up sending the pancakes back since the restaurant was out of syrup at the time.The 'cheeks' and grits dish was delicious and a large enough portion to split, I decided not to order a replacement dish for my pancakes.Good food just a few minor mishaps.

4.0,4.0,"Don't be intimidated by the suits populating the bar, like I was. Don't be afraid that it's as dark as the inside of Hollister, and don't bring your own flashlight (other guests will not be as amused as you are). Barrel is great and homey. The downstairs area provides a lot more first-come-first-serve seating, and there were definitely a couple times that Barrel gave me exactly what I needed when I didn't even know I needed it. 1. Fried Chicken In 30 degree weather, as a (weak) CA transplant I usually seek out soup and warm carby goodness. Who knew that the amazing fried chicken at Barrel was actually a great way to remedy cold and restore faith in life (sorry, seasonal affective disorder talking). It's been a while since I've had some amazing fried chicken, and it really brought light and crispiness back into my dark and damp world. 2. ""Do you want to just keep the Mac and Cheese? It's on me.""*Mac and Cheese arrived at our table, even though we (stupidly, in retrospect) didn't originally order it. Anyway, the manager then uttered those 13 words quoted above -- arguably the most beautiful combination of English words ever uttered in history. Cheesy, breadcrumby, derrrrrlicious. Excellent companion to the aforementioned fried chicken. Other than that, we ordered the BBQ Sticky Buns (solid) and the brussel sprouts (there was a lot going on -- fish sauce, sunflower seeds, spiciness, but still pretty good). Like I said, downside is it's pretty dark. You never really know what you're getting (or what color it is) until you step out into the real world of human lighting. Opening our box of leftovers solicited a loud ""WHOA"" from my roommate and me, which translates roughly into: ""hey brussel sprouts, didn't know you were that color"". Overall, would come back, had a great meal, service a little slow, but great food. Not a place I will crave EVERY-DAMN-DAY but a once in a while spot that always does the job.*They later forgot that it was ""on them"" so it appeared on our check, but they were super apologetic and great about fixing this little error.

4.0,4.0,"Solid spot.  Solid bar. Really an  amazing transformation of the 18th Amendment, which had its charms (and was 10 feet from my office), but you wouldn't even come close to recognizing the place.  As would be expected, it reminds me a lot of The Pig on 14th back when it first dropped (I think the food there has gone down in quality since); I think this is because the old chef at the Pig is running things at Barrel now.Regardless, it's a great place for a drink -- obviously a bourbon -- and some bar bites / small plates.  Haven't had a full sit down meal yet, but the Hill is lacking in places with enough bar space where you can both eat AND drink something that wasn't tossed in the deep fryer.  Some of the bourbon prices will make your eyes bulge, but the selection is excellent so if there's one you've always wanted to try: this is where you'll find it.They also seem to be doing a bunch of local brewery Tap Takeovers which is cool.  The DC Brau one shortly after they opened was awesome; a lot of Brau's you normally only find in a can on draft (they taste much better).Protip: stick to beers or bourbons; not sure the cocktail's are anything special for their price point.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Derek H.,"Washington, DC",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington
4.0,4.0,"Barrel is one of the better meals I've had recently, and I cannot wait to return for the food and for drinks made by one of the best bartenders in the city.  However, the noise level and typical yuppy crowd probably preclude me from being a regular.   We stopped in for a drink and a bite, but the menu looked really good, so I ordered more than I anticipated.  Barrel is definitely fashioned how I would imagine an old-timey saloon to be and I like it.  However, I cannot stand the noise level in there.  It was so loud that I could not hear Victoria, and we were seated next to each other.  This is not a club, it's a bar/restaurant.  It's as though they forgot the soundproofing.  Also, they appeared understaffed on this particular evening (a Thursday).  The limited food on the happy hour menu doesn't entice me, but the $5 cocktail or $5 bourbon does.  I can't remember the name of the cocktail we had (mainly because I couldn't hear it), but it was similar to an old-fashioned, and it was quite well-made and smooth, without any harshness.  I had two, but next time, I think I'll do three.  It was a great, classic cocktail.To eat, I had the mac and cheese and gnocchi.  I highly recommend both.  The mac and cheese is creamy, flavorful, served piping hot and with a touch of truffle oil.  It's one of my top choices for mac and cheese in DC.  The gnocchi is filled with fonduta, and paired with rabbit carnitas, roast fennel, and bacon.  The gnocchi were perfectly browned.  The bacon was thick and salty (but not overly so) and carnitas tender.  The entire dish was texturally interesting and beautifully presented.  While I understand Barrel cannot control who frequents their establishment, I do hope they add some soundproofing.  There's very few restaurants with food that compels me back, but this is one of them.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Lia M.,"Arlington, VA",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington

4.0,4.0,"3.5 overallWent for a quick dinner and drinks. The beer and cocktails have little to no criticism, there is a nice on tap selection and in true form to the name the cocktails and whiskey in particular is incredible. A lot is left to the imagination in the wine department, I would steer clear. The menu is small cut creative. The smoked duck charcuterie plate was delicious but more $13 there was barely enough for two to share let alone four. That's a bit disappointing for the cost. The mains and pastas are generous portions for the cost and executed very well. We had a lobster pasta and wild boar paparedelle that were both delicious. The fried chicken was spectacular although a bit light in the sauce department and could have used a green to accompany. Overall I would definitely go back for a quick dinner and drink. Vegetarians stay far away, there are almost no options. If you are looking for a larger selection or quiet ambience this also isn't the best option, it teaters on sports bar upstairs.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Spencer L.,"Arlington, VA",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington
4.0,4.0,"I found Barrel quite by accident, looking for dining establishments near our hotel. My husband has become quite fond of bourbon so I knew this would be a real treat for him.  The pros: The list of bourbons is stellar; the atmosphere is pretty cool; and the service is great.  Cons: It is loud; there are no real vegetarian choices (my husband is a veg, but was willing to make an exception for the bourbon list--I have friends that would love the selection, but couldn't eat here at all); and the first come, first served seating is a bit much for the price tag.Overall, I have to say it is a very good execution of the concept and that the bourbon list makes up for my few quibbles.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Robena M.,"Chapel Hill, NC",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington
4.0,2.0,I wish I could love this place but unfortunately for me (great for them) it was too busy for me to even enjoy it.. I waited over an hour for seats upstairs to Barrel. Finally I just gave up and left.   I stayed downstairs in Elixir and the drinks were pretty good I enjoyed the Pisco Punch but I wanted to experience upstairs.. Maybe in the future but until wasn't pleased that it overly busy.,228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Maggie N.,"Orlando, FL",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington

4.0,4.0,"Very very nice!  Though the bar was packed (not in a bad way), the setup is very inviting to meeting new people and enjoying great conversations amongst friends. Two friends of mine and I had a table and the service was great. We ordered their ""sausage of the day"" and an order of fries. The sausage was fresh and had a great taste, and the fries...well, I don't know how to express how thing cut fries could taste so good, but they do!  Anyways, I bookmarked this place for their bourbon/whiskey selection and they did not disappoint.  I had an Old Fashioned (perfectly prepared with a cocktail cherry) and also had The Bucket, which is a great bourbon cocktail! They also have a decent size list of really good and tough-to-find craft beers. AND THEN...in the back of the bar, there is a staircase that leads down to the Elixir Bar!  What a welcomed surprise! This space is much smaller and more intimate, but in a casual, inviting, and not necessarily romantic kind of way. This space includes an amazing glass wall with lighting and shelves showcasing their impressive selection of bourbons.  My next visit to Barrel (which will be very soon) will include the Elixir Bar.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Dorian M.,"Manhattan, NY",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington
4.0,5.0,"I cannot say enough good things about this place! I am a brown liquor kinda girl! I hesitate to write this in fear of everyone wanting to go see my new favorite bartender in DC Chris Martino! He is knowledgeable about all his spirits and can the fact he can make something on the fly is great without much knowledge or help from me. So the back story - I came in here on Mother's day after spending a great day smoking cigars, I had dinner with my man at Matchbox and ordered a Blackberry  Pisco Sour off their menu. When it arrived it looked well for about the first taste (then I notice all this egg white power floating around - GROSS is all I can say).I needed to cleanse my palette of this gross drink, and the God's were shining down on me this night as Barrel was open and a young man by the of Chris was at the bar! He asked how he could help me and I told him I had just had this gross drink (& I paid for it) and could he please make me something, anything that would take this taste out of my mouth. OMG!!!! He said he was going to make me a Huckleberry Pisco sour with La Dialada(sp) Pisco in it! I was like OK but if I don't like it you are buying it and he said fine and let me say this when a bartender says that I know that I am going to get a cocktail that is going to hit on all the notes I am looking for. Chris proved to me in one drink that he knew what he was doing and all I wanted was more. 1st he used real egg whites like you are supposed to in a Pisco Sour (sans the flavor only use real egg whites) Second of all it was pretty and I am a girl after all. Lastly, he left me wanting to try more of his cocktails, when you are lucky enough to find a bartender like Chris Martino in this town who is so knowledgeable and cares about the cocktails he puts in front of you that is a feat in itself. So be the end of the night Chris had turned my pitiful night into an AMAZING night! Thank you Chris Martino - you are my favorite new place to drink and I will be requesting that you make my cocktails!

4.0,3.0,"Came here with a group for happy hour. We found a spot easily which was great. The decor is very modern and beautiful, with the walls and tables made out of wood. Had a ""speakeasy"" feel. Absolutely loved the atmosphere. However, the drinks weren't very good. I ordered two drinks and both tasted like medicine. I would have not said anything about this, but everyone else in my group agreed that the drinks tasted terrible. I haven't tried the food but it sure did look and smell delicious! The ambiance and service helps give this place some stars, but the drinks are worth 2 stars at most.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Lex G.,"Hamden, CT",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington
4.0,4.0,"3.75 starsI've been here several times, all for different types of occasions, and the norm seems to be that the food is great, the drinks vary in quality and consistency, and the service is hit or miss. If you pick and choose the good items or good days, Barrel is easily a five star establishment. However, the vicissitude of each experience has not followed a pattern and I'm left wondering what my next trip to Barrel will have in store.Barrel is close enough to our house to walk and we've certainly taken advantage of this convenience. Our first trip was for a happy hour and we were able to snag a high top table in the front on the main floor for ourselves and another couple. The HH drinks include a cocktail or select beer for $5. We nibbled on the HH biscuits and ham and BBQ buns while we waited for our friends and were highly impressed with the country biscuits. The honey butter melted as soon as it touched the mini-biscuits. I could easily have eaten half a dozen of these. Our other food selections for the evening matched the quality but the drinks were a bit of a letdown. The inconsistency of the drinks became most apparent when two of us ordered the same drink in different rounds and they tasted markedly different. Cocktail mixology is a lot like baking; even the slightest error in proportions can ruin a product. Perhaps that's why all of the barrel aged cocktails were far superior to those made to order - they involved no measuring on the spot and thus needed little attention from the bartender on a busy evening.Learning from our first experience, Justin and I stuck mostly to barrel aged cocktails on our second trip - a low-key summer dinner for four. By this point the menu had transitioned from being mainly small plates to only appetizers or entrees. The entrees were all outstanding. In addition to being somewhat Southern-focused, there is an abundance of seasonable vegetables and some gamey meat. The wild boar pappardelle was rich and flavorful, second only to the gnocchi with rabbit carnitas which was perfectly balanced by contrast of the intense flavors of fonduta and bacon, and the fennel and fava beans. The portion sizes were just right, too. Big enough to be a satisfying meal yet not enough to make you sluggish.After the near perfect experience at dinner, I picked Barrel as my going away brunch spot (one can never have enough going away celebrations). It seemed a bit odd that I was told over the phone that I wouldn't need reservations in advance, even for a party of six, but seeing as they hadn't been serving brunch for very long at this point, I didn't overthink it. The pendulum swung the other way, and this experience was lacking in service and timeliness of the kitchen's output. The ""pick your own meat"" Bloody Mary was a big hit after seeing the menu but the execution of it was inadequate. You're charged an extra $4 for the meat/garnish (which isn't noted on the menu), but all of them were missing parts of the garnish, which the waitress didn't mention and the price didn't reflect. Despite weak drinks with missing ingredients (at $14 each after picking your own meat), we ordered our food, knowing that at least that would be good. The food was good...for those of us who received it. Each of us ordered one main and they didn't come out at the same time. These aren't tapas that can be staggered; by the time the last person had received their entrée, the first was done eating. There was neither an explanation nor an apology, and really there was no excuse since we were practically the only table in the restaurant. This was surprising since the service on our other two visits had been friendly, informative and attentive. It's really quite sad that the focus of this meal became a question of if/when everyone would actually receive their food rather than the food itself, as my pulled pork pupusas were amazing and full of flavor. They definitely knew how to cook in that kitchen, just apparently couldn't cook multiple things at the same time.The inconsistency in service and beverages isn't enough to mar our desire to revisit Barrel - at least not for dinner. Of note, the downstairs bar does have a different cocktail menu but is closed on Mondays and during brunch. At your request, the upstairs bartenders can make the items from the other menu. And for those who don't care for bourbon, the majority of the cocktails are with other spirits. Even the barrel aged cocktails have vodka, gin and tequila options.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Suzy D.,"Washington, DC",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington

Try to get there in the evening on a weekend to try their elixir bar downstairs (really knowledgeable bartenders who are more than happy to help you expand your taste in bourbon).Ambience/Service: The main floor is open and welcoming, the bar downstairs has a cool cellar feel (pardon the pun).

4.0,4.0,"Let us bow our heads in remembrance of the passing of yet another Pennsylvania Avenue dive bar.  Gone are the days when you could get picked up in the dank 18th Amendment basement by a portly, sweatpant-clad Cap Police officer who identifies himself only as ""Snacks"".  Gone are the days when nineteen-and-a-half easily rounded up to twenty-one.  Gone are the days when...anyone on the Hill still remembered LBB (Life Before Barrel).Barrel is the bee's hot new knees.  Hip, well-executed, and without coming across as trying too hard to do so.  Sitting in the same space when I once lapped up plastic cups of vodka cran as a youngster, I found myself transported to the sophisticated cool of the coastal South where the bar staff wears gingham and whiskey's called brown water.  Barrel does bourbon, and for the mildly-polished bourbon drinker, it does bourbon well.  Listings for 100+ varieties at DC-reasonable prices make an evening of playing whiskey connoisseur feasible.  Small batch cocktails for the not as ballsy rest in barrels headed with the labels NOW, NEXT, and LATER to keep your whistle wet with anticipation.  And don't forget everyone's favorite other brown water--the beer list is to-the-point but remains kick ass with a mix of local and craft brews.All this drankin' will make any girl hungry, and Barrel doesn't disappoint.  Dare I say the Carolina BBQ sticky buns are the best tasting barbecue in DC?  Yes, yes I dare.  Pair that with friendly, well-seasoned service and  I say we have a winner!  A great way to kick off date night or a final destination with pals, Barrel's quickly on its way to becoming a Cap Hill fixture.",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Theresa L.,"Washington, DC",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington

4.0,4.0,"On the eve of my birthday, me friends took me out to Capitol Hill's newest restaurant and bar. Before we went, I did a little research and found out the owner of Barrel also owns Union Pub near Union Station. Since everyone knows only tools go to Union Pub, I was trying really hard not to judge Barrel before giving it a try (to avoid being a tool myself). There's an upstairs and a downstairs both with their own bars. The downstairs looked cooler than the upstairs, but the tables were too big so we went upstairs. We each ordered a drink. I got the Raspberry Elyx Mule and it was just okay. If you like spirit forward drinks, you'll love the Bucket and the Greenpoint.For an appetizer, I ordered their baked beans and it was amazing! Then out came our main dishes and that is when we started to get confused. For a restaurant/ bar that looks very manly, the dishes were tiny! I ordered the BBQ pulled pork buns and three very small sliders came out. My friend ordered the scallops and they should change the name to scallop because there was literally just one of them. All the food tasted good, but we were all still hungry afterwards. And we waited, and waited, and waited for our server to finally come by and ask us if we were done (There's grace for new servers).Warning: If you do not like smokey flavored food, don't go here. Many of their dishes have a hint of the taste of a campfire. I give this place a three. I'm glad it's on the Hill and it is definitely unique, but they seem like a teenager- not really sure who they are just yet.UPDATE: I have since been back a few times for their fries and they have surprisingly great fries!",228,"Washington, DC",Barrel,Austin G.,"Washington, DC",2025433622,/biz/barrel-washington
4.5,5.0,"Bad Saint is so good it had me speaking in tongues...My family's native tongue but my knowledge is limited to several words (mostly bad ones) so here you go: Busog ng! Masarap! Basically that means everything was delicious and by the time I walked out I was so full that I had a full on pimp walk lean. The pope was in town and we were blessed immediately with a table for 3, no wait. Thank you Papa! I had friends who went over the weekend and had to wait almost 2.5 hours so you know this was a miracle in itself.I usually write about service as an afterthought of a meal but from the moment we walked through the door we were greeted with a woman who was rocking the biggest smile / best red lipstick game ever. Everyone who came in contact with us afterwards was very gracious, knowledgeable and efficient which was very surprising since they have only been open for a few weeks now. Huge kudos! Every detail was well thought out from the fork and spoon serving sets (most Filipinos forego the knives) to the extra plates that we were given (and replenished) so we could share our dishes appropriately. Speaking of the dishes -- everything was superb! While most of the restaurants in town do a good job of cooking homestyle dishes that your Lola or auntie would make, Bad Saint kicks everything up about five or ten notches up. Everything was very stylish in presentation and you can tell was prepared by someone with a chef's palette. Complimentary Appetizer - Prawn Crackers with a side of Shrimp Paste (Bagaoong). This was definitely a nice touch! My husband has shunned bagaoong his whole life but discovered a taste for it here. Miracle #2!Kinilaw: Basically thinly sliced tuna ceviche. This surely blows my grandpa's version out of the water and is a great starter. This came out with the quickness!Ukoy - Sweet potato, shrimp fritters. This was a favorite snack growing up but Bad Saint's version is a little less latke like and has more of a bird's nest texture. This allowed the oil to cook all of the little crevices and cook it so the whole thing was super crispy . Served with some chili salt to sprinkle on top. Yum, yum. The extra okra in it made me feel less guilty because I did not order anything in the vegetable section. Ginisang Tulya - This was recommended as a favorite dish by everyone who worked there but quite honestly I was doubting how good manila clams could actually be. I was wrong, this dish was absolutely fantastic. Make sure to ask for extra rice to soak up all of that good salty broth -- the chinese sausage adds a nice sweetness to everything too.Adobong Pusit - Squid, adobo style! One of my favorite dishes ever and goes well with extra rice (I'm a carb-a-holic, can you tell?). The little garlic crispies were a nice touch. Pancit - A traditional Filipino fiesta dish this was the most fanciful and flavor packed version I have tried in my entire 30 years of life.Tapa - When you look on the menu you think you are ordering this in salad format. I'm fat so thank goodness this was not the case...It was served with more rice and the most dope looking egg I have ever seen. ***THREE CHEERS***  It reminded me of my favorite Laos beef jerky + my favorite Vietnamese shaky beef dish mashed up together with a Filipino twist. And because I'm super hedonistic:Bilo Bilo for desert. Purple rice in a coconut cream with seared peaches. This was my first time ever trying bilo bilo and I was a fan! The fat purple rice pieces rolled around my tongue like a happy little baby. It was the perfect way to end the meal.They also gave everyone a complimentary piece of biko which is a caramelized coconut rice cake that is seen at almost every Filipino party you will ever attend. What made this special was the salted rice puffs on top which was a welcome and nice surprise.They also have a nice but small collection of Asian inspired cocktails and of course San Miguel beer.After all of this food I was prepared to harvest my liver in a box as payment but everything was surprisingly very, very affordable. This restaurant had tons of delays opening up but it looks like all of the hard work paid off.

4.5,4.0,"I was slightly delirious from hunger when I finally got my food at about 10 p.m. I thought on a rainy Monday night, I could get a seat when I showed up at 7:30. Nope! I was even told that I might not get a seat that night-- I put my name on the waitlist for the actual list. Luckily, after finally finding a place to get a drink and linger down the street, I got a text saying a table would probably open up between 9:15 and 9:30 (though it ended up being closer to 9:45 before we sat down). I don't have much of a point of reference for Filipino food, given its dearth in the area (and I guess my lack of Filipino friends), but I was eager to try everything. My favorite items were the kinilaw, which was a lightly seared, tuna ceviche-type thing that had tons of flavor (despite my usual meh feeling on raw fish), the clams (!!!) with the chinese sausage (definitely get those clams in the sauce-- where all the clammy goodness has gone), the bitter melon with egg, tomato and black beans (I don't usually like bitter melon unless it's red and ripe) and the purple rice dessert with peaches and plums (despite being super full I couldn't stop eating it). The shrimp fritters with sweet potato and leeks wasn't bad, it's kind of a lacy, crunchy web that you dip into fish sauce, but it didn't blow me away. I also found the rice noodles all right but not something to write home about (though I'll say it kept very well as leftovers-- didn't congeal or feel greasy when I reheated it in the microwave the next day). All the portions and prices seemed pretty reasonable-- the first couple of items in the section tend to be smaller plates, while the latter few are larger, but it's great to share everything. If this is what Filipino food is like, I need lots more of it. The menu is pretty small, so I'd like to eat my way through it-- and get those clams again!",23,"Washington, DC",Bad Saint,Karen S.,"College Park, MD",,/biz/bad-saint-washington
4.5,4.0,"Wavering between 3.5 and 4 stars. BUT before I begin my review, I must make this public service announcement: Make sure you arrive MORE THAN AN HOUR before closing time. The first time my friend and I attempted to dine here (it was a Tuesday night), we were turned away at the 1 hour before closing mark because not only is there limited space, but there was already a long queue of eager diners. Fair enough. We were better prepared this time around and arrived an hour and a half before closing on a Saturday night. ***END PSA***We decided to grab a drink at Wonderland Ballroom during our 30-minute wait and received a text as soon as our table was ready (I love it when restaurants utilize technology). I'd like to take a moment to thank the food gods for blessing us with THE BEST seats in the house. We were seated at the bar stools right next to the door where we could feel the summer breeze, and right in front of the bar where we could watch all of the magic cocktail mixing happen. Not only that, but we also had a crystal clear view of the entire open kitchen.Bad Saint can be characterized as stylish, creative and a breath of fresh air. The atmosphere was wonderful with its high ceilings, open kitchen, and modernized decor. The feel, the fact that you can watch everything being made, and the aromas made for a more engaging dining experience than you can find anywhere else in the city (fair warning, you WILL smell like food after you leave).I am not much of a Filipino food connoisseur, but I have had your usual pancit, lumpia, longanisa breakfast with garlic fried rice and eggs, halo halo and taron at a few friends' houses as well as a few restaurants in New York City. Like Kimberly S. had mentioned in her review, Bad Saint takes traditional Filipino food and ""kicks it up 5 or 10 notches"". Everything was very skillfully crafted with precision and down to the last detail.INIHAW NA LIEMPO ($14 pork belly, acharra, tamarind sauce): Think pork belly butter lettuce wraps. Although tasty, I felt that the pork belly was too dry. My friend and I both agreed that this was our least favorite.UKOY ($8 freshwater shrimp fritters, sweet potato, leeks): The shrimp was great but the texture was too crunchy as if it was in the deep frier for far too long. I would have preferred a softer and chewier center with a light to moderate crispiness on the outside. Simply put, it was more veggie chip-like than fritter-like. This also came with what seemed like chili salt and a lime based sauce on the side, which I did not care for because the sauce was too salty.PINIRITONG ISRA ($24 whole fried dorado, lemongrass, and tomatoes): Perfectly fried and well-seasoned fish. This was one of my favorites of the night as the sauce was very palatable. (comes with a side of garlic rice which is a plus)TAPA ($16 dried beef, duck eggs, green salad): The most enjoyable dish of the night. To plainly describe the dried beef, it was a savory beef that was 50% to beef jerky status. The egg was poached to utter perfection, the garlic rice was rich with mouth watering flavor, and the salad and onions tied everything together quite nicely on the palate. One thing that I noticed was that the garlic rice in the Tapa is ten times better and more flavorful than the garlic rice that was given with the fish. There was a sauce that came with this as well, but I was not a big fan of it, as it was far too salty. Being Vietnamese, I mistakenly doused my bite (thank goodness it wasn't the whole thing plate) with the sauce as if it was the sauce that we use in our culture called nuoc mam (fish sauce), and felt instant regret as soon as it hit my tongue.Overall, a great place. Although I wasn't planning on returning any time soon, due to mixed feelings about the food, we were able to exchange a few words with the wonderful head Chef Tom, who informed us they will be making some modifications and additions to the menu soon, so I am definitely interested in checking that out!",23,"Washington, DC",Bad Saint,Alida H.,"Sterling, VA",,/biz/bad-saint-washington
4.5,3.0,"Would have given this place two stars if it weren't for the good customer service. Let me start off by saying I REALLY wanted to like this place. New place, new concept, great reviews and near where I live. I also want to say that I didn't have an awful experience either. We were seated without any trouble and our waitress was a gem throughout the experience. I ordered a delicious Manila sling cocktail. At this point, the restaurant can do no wrong. I'm cozy and feeling very welcomed. As a vegetarian, my options were limited (four) but I kind of prefer that. Makes choosing less difficult. I ordered the bitter melon and the rice noodles with mushrooms. the rice noodles came out first and I could only get a few bites down. The food was WAY too salty. Disclaimer: I'm very open to different flavors and like eating a wide range of dishes. I had the same salt issue with the melon dish as well. I couldn't continue eating my food because the salt was overwhelming...and I love salt. My boyfriend had the pork belly not listed on the menu. He said it was a bit dry and would give it a 5/10. He really enjoyed the clam and sausage dish however. The staff was extremely apologetic and extremely willing to make things right. They brought out the two other dishes I had not ordered completely void of salt this time. The additional dishes were fine but nothing to write home about. They did comp my food items on the bill as well without asking. I was hoping this would be a local spot I'd go to again and again and I still want to like it but I can't change the food experience. The customer service is obviously very good and they emphasized that the menu changes often so I should come back. There are so many other restaurants to try in D.C. that I probably won't come back but others may enjoy this restaurant.

4.5,4.0,"Lucked out and got seats for two around 7:30 on a Monday night! They were quoting a 2 hour wait, but as we were about to call it quits, the hostess grabbed us stating that two people had cancelled. There are only 25 seats total in the entire restaurant so it is very small. But it's very cozy and the ambiance is inviting. Even though the space is small, the décor and design is hip and modern, with staff members' family pictures and Filipino arts and crafts. Even the bathroom walls are decorated with Filipino punkzines. Pinoy punk is heard in the background. Nick Pimentel and Genevieve Villamora of Room 11, along with chef Tom Cunanan from Ardeo + Bardeo, have created a restaurant dedicated to Filipino staples and regional food. The menu will rotate on a seasonal basis, and they've already changed their menu despite being open for a mere 3 weeks. The menu breaks down into 3 categories - Gulay (veggies and salads), Isda At Iba Pa (fish and more), and Carne (meat). My recommendation is to try something from every category. Also, order more! My boyfriend and I originally ordered 3 plates but quickly realized that these plates are fairly nouveau-sized so we asked for our menus back to order more. +Ginisang Ampalaya {bitter melon, farm egg, preserved black beans}: $9+Kinilaw {tuna, avocado, chilies}: $12+Ginisang Tulya {littleneck clams, Chinese sausage, Sichuan chile}: $18+Inihaw Na Liempo {pork belly, acharra, tamarind sauce}: $14+Tapa {dried beef, farm egg, green salad}: $16We started off with Kinilaw, which was essentially tuna ceviche. Wonderful starter, not too heavy and great flavor with the chilies and avocado sauce. Next came the Inihaw Na Liempo. This was a delicious pork belly dish marinated in tamarind sauce and garnished with acharra. You eat them as a wrap and the pork belly is fantastic. Then, we had the Ginisang Tulya. The clams were tasty and we devoured the rest of the sauce with our rice, of which they were not hesitant to give us more. The Tapa is very, very good. I loved the farm egg and the mixture of flavors with the rice, salad, and dried beef. Finally, the Ginisang Ampalaya. If you're not a fan of bitter melon, this dish may be a little hard to swallow but they did a nice job of toning down the bitterness with the other ingredients. It's also a very healthy dish since bitter melon is chock full of nutrients. Overall, great food and wonderful service. A little pricier given their small plates but very unique cuisine. Their limited space is great for dates or small groups (3-4) of friends but does not cater towards a larger group.",23,"Washington, DC",Bad Saint,Alice W.,"Fairfax, VA",,/biz/bad-saint-washington
4.5,5.0,"MARAMING SARAP!...after months of blog news and updates and their previous pop-up, Bad Saint officially opened Thurs Sept 3, 2015!Filipino cuisine is having its trendy moment in DC right now and Bad Saint fits right in there. Also its authentic vibe fits right into the 11th St neighborhood befittingly in between Wonderland and Room 11.What used to be a small beauty salon is now a cozy quiche Filipino restaurant/kitchen. Seating definitely is limited with only two real tables and the remainder of the seating is counter space. The bar has two seats, one additional counter seat is near the bar but actually facing the kitchen. Nick the owner was obviously present and he definitely did a great job embodying the Filipino spirit into his restaurant...the ambience with its wooden motif of ubiquitous objects you'd see at an auntie's house or the touch of family and Catholic roots with its paradoxically befitting but slightly irreverent candle-lit display of loved ones with a headless Santo Nino are nice details that make the place uniquely inviting. We are definitely glad we came on their first night since I am sure this upcoming Labor Day weekend, with word of mouth buzz, they will most definitely have a nice crowd coming in for dinner these next few days. There is a hostess at the door who will take down your name and phone number on a clipboard and will call you when a spot is open...we waited about 30min for two (MY ADVICE: get a drink at Wonderland while you wait since there really is no bar space to hang out at.... you don't have to physically wait in front of the restaurant if you don't want to since she will txt/call you!)Photos are posted along with the menu. They definitely get plus points for their cocktails particularly the Willy Santos, which has a nice touch of calamansi in it. The Zamboanga Zeinie also has a nice balance of cognac and pineapple.Their menu interestingly is not separated by appetizers, courses, and dessert. It's just one page separated into vegetables/salads, seafood, and meat...it's a bit tapas style with some at entree prices with the amount of food varying between each dish.From the ""Gulay"" section we got the Pancit Bihon Guisado, obviously a classic Filipino rice noodle dish. They use a very thin noodle and overall I had no complaints. A nice slice of lime or calamansi on the side would have made it perfect.From the ""Isda at Iba Pa"" section, we got the Ginisang Tulya which were essentially clams with sausage...HANDS DOWN our favorite dish of the night. Super flavorful and we even ate up the broth right down to an empty bowl!From the ""Carne"" section, we got the lumping shanghai, which are also your classic egg rolls (and props to them for denoting them as shanghai egg rolls which is the way most Filipinos will make them compared to other variations)..and yes they were cooked extremely well and were appropriately thin and golden brown.The inihaw na liempo was essentially like a pork belly lettuce wrap..smaller in appearance than what I expected but was great with its tamarind sauce.And their chicken dish the inasal na manok...the chicken itself was cooked well and taste good but what elevated it was the purple rice that came with it....I was expecting more of a chicken adobo but their intention may have been more of that street BBQ style chicken.And YES they do have one dessert dish...and no it is NOT halo-halo nor is it ube ice cream...they had an interesting version of ""bilo bilo""which is sticky rice in coconut milk with theirs having clumps of plums in it. I grew up with it having more doughy balls in it hence this one was more porridge like. Note this is NOT on the printed menu (yet?) but if you ask the waitress about dessert she will let you know about it.The cooks were nice enough to even give us an extra treat before we left and was I guess dessert dish #2...biko! Another sticky rice dessert as a cake version....yes filipinos do love their sticky rice!Overall, everything was nicely done with many classic and authentic styles all with their Bad Saint twists..I liked how everything had some acidity or tartness to it which is the flavor I grew up with...their start-up menu definitely has room to expand and grow and look forward to what they have to offer in the future.Nick the owner, the cooks, hostess and waitresses (thanks Stephanie!) were all great and welcoming. Obviously as their first night run, they all seemed super focused at getting things done right and well....and I don't blame them! I do wish Bad Saint much success so all you yelpers please go check it out!We've come a long way from our suburban shopping mart Filipino restaurant with plastic utensils and tablecloths (which of course are timeless and that's a good thing.",23,"Washington, DC",Bad Saint,James Kimo L.,"Washington, DC",,/biz/bad-saint-washington
4.5,4.0,"Bad Saint is an upscale Filipino joint in Columbia Heights. A lot of the dishes are not typical dishes you'd find in a Filipino household but lots of the same flavors. We ordered the kinilaw, ukoy, lumpia, inihaw and the manok. We were also served a free tester dish of adobo short ribs that they were thinking of making a special.However, two staples of Filipino cuisine were missing: quantity and plain white rice. The serving sizes were more like tapas than family style. The servers and hostess were very nice, but we waited two hours to be seated and the space feels a bit cramped. It's best to come early when they open or else you're put on a waiting list. It's great to see a Filipino place in DC, and I'd love to see an expanded space and menu in the future.",23,"Washington, DC",Bad Saint,Marian M.,"Boston, MA",,/biz/bad-saint-washington
4.5,5.0,My wife and I came just after they opened at 5:35 (a must) to get seated.  I started with a cocktail with Rye and my wife had a red wine.   The ambiance is cozy with authentic decor.  The owners and hosts Nick and Genevieve were  extremely friendly from the time we set foot inside until the very end of our meal.  My wife and I shared pan cit noodles and the grilled tuna jaw.  The noodles were delicious carrying a very slight sour citrus flavor with vegetables.  The fish was my wife's favorite.  The char on the fish was amazing along with the flavor. I am so happy to see yet another fantastic restaurant in my neighborhood open without disappointing.   We look forward to enjoying many more meals at the Bad Saint.,23,"Washington, DC",Bad Saint,Curtis M.,"Washington, DC",,/biz/bad-saint-washington
4.5,5.0,"Five stars all around. My Monday night dinner buddy and I went here for a Monday night dinner and LOVED it. The restaurant is right next to Room 11 in a small space that fits around 26 or so. It's small and most of the tables are along walls, but it works without making you feel crowded. The restaurant itself looks like a top NYC restaurant.The food and drinks are out of this world! We ordered the mango salad, pork belly, shrimp fritters, and beef/pork spring rolls. Each dish came out perfectly presented, full of flavor, and amazing. There wasn't a thing we didn't like. Also, get the one dessert they have. I LOVE chocolate and have a bad attitude toward non-chocolate dessert, but this dessert rivals even Swiss chocolate. It's purple rice, coconut milk, plums, and peaches, which sounds disgusting, but it's OUT OF THIS WORLD!The service is impeccable. Everyone we met, was genuinely nice and smooth. I'll be back for sure!",23,"Washington, DC",Bad Saint,Austin G.,"Washington, DC",,/biz/bad-saint-washington
4.5,5.0,"I've known about Bad Saint for some time, though I couldn't make it to the pop-ups. In short, this place is amazing, everything is good, you should go.Apparently the restaurant seats 26 people in total, and you'll have to have everyone in your party with you before you're seated. We showed up right when it opened at 5:30. Besides a little strangeness at the beginning with the seating, the service was terrific from the hostess, waitress, and everyone else. The waitress came at appropriate times to take our orders, and water was refilled promptly; no problems with service at all.We had the inihaw na liempo (pork belly), pancit bihon (rice noodles), lumpiang shanghai (eggrolls) and tapa (dried beef). Of the four dishes, our favorite was the tapa. I wasn't actually expecting to like the tapa that much simply because it was one of my favorite dishes that my grandma used to make. But the tapa, while a little pricey, was excellent; not too tough, marinated perfectly. The garlic rice was perfection. When it said it would come with a green salad, I was a little skeptical, imagining some green lettuce plopped on the side. What actually came with it was quite refreshing; herbs and fresh red and yellow tomatoes. I also loved the soft-boiled egg. Get the tapa!My second favorite was the pork belly. I didn't know what to expect but it was very well-cooked, melt-in-your-mouth quality. I thought the lumpiang shanghai was fine, but honestly I prefer the versions at your local turo turo and I thought the version here was maybe a bit too high-brow, but I would still recommend it for a meaty appetizer. The pancit bihon was a little bit of a disappointment. The quality of the dish was very good; the woodear mushrooms were as well-made as they could be; but I thought that the dish was overpowered by ginger. I also, perhaps unfairly, am comparing it to my grandma's pancit bihon, and nothing can top that... But for a varied noodle dish with a lot of vegetables, I'd recommend it. It's also a sizeable portion too for the price.For dessert we had the biko; you have to request it from the waiter. It was okay, the coconut more of an aftertaste than the primary flavor. The crispies on top of it were a nice touch. Even better was that it was actually complimentary from the restaurant (thank you!)The only thing I feel like I would have wanted to have known beforehand, was that it was pretty warm; there was decent air circulation, but if you're sensitive to heat and smoke (the kitchen and grill could literally be at your back), then maybe wear something light or go when it's cooler. We showed up early because we didn't want to wait, but on a Wednesday at 7 pm the restaurant wasn't full. So, I implore you: go to Bad Saint, stat. They are a wonderful restaurant, terrific cooking, and really friendly and enthusiastic staff. They beat Maharlika and Jeepney in NYC by miles. I look forward to my next visit!",23,"Washington, DC",Bad Saint,Claire B.,"Princeton, NJ",,/biz/bad-saint-washington
4.5,4.0,"Fantastic service, unpretentious atmosphere, excellent opportunity to learn about Filipino food from knowledgeable staff, food items (the ones we ordered) could use refining. Food (3/5): The menu changes frequently, and the three sections are smartly divided into Veg, Fish, and Meat options, with portions listed in ascending order--no appetizers. The limited choices give it a more homey feel; it makes sense in a small restaurant context where kitchen staff can focus on doing a few things right rather than a bunch of things all at once; you know the food's fresh. Ample vegetarian options, and there's always something off-menu. I had the little-neck clams and pork belly (off menu), my girlfriend had noodles and bitter-melon hash (forgive me, I forgot the exact name). Pork Belly: Big points for creativity; served bite-size w/ a sweet/sour chutney and a slice of spicy pepper to pop through the fat, on top of carrot/pepper pickle--a perfect flavor combo, though the actual meat came out tepid, and had been slightly overcooked to the point of being dry/tough. Not the best meat, but excellent presentation/overall flavor. Clams: Served w/ Chinese sausage in a briny and spicy sauce--these were fantastic and filling when combined with a little rice-bowl. Veg Dishes: Both the noodles and bitter melon came over-salted and unfortunately my (vegetarian) girlfriend was unable to finish them. Had the salt not been a factor, the bitter melon hash would have truly been an interesting flavor; definitely worth trying as an accompanying dish. The attentive staff immediately apologized and replaced her dishes with a bok-choy stir fry and salad. Both these latter dishes were tasty (and deeply appreciated), but missed on unique flavors. The salad seemed to be a simple vinaigrette with mango added; the bok-choy was (very understandably) under-salted. We could tell they tried very hard, and so we appreciated these nonetheless. Drinks (5/5): Super creative options utilizing genuine Filipino ingredients and liquors that I'd never heard of. Flavors really popped, and the waitress explained each cocktail in loving detail. The cocktails we ordered featured subtle, fruity, and floral notes, very well balanced so as to round out both acidity and sweetness. Staff (5/5): Possibly among the best service I've received in DC. Kind, attentive, and unpretentious. All this, without being overbearing or rushing in spite of the space's limited capacity. The waitress carefully and eagerly explained all aspects of the menu to us, and their connection within Filipino cuisine (of which my knowledge is limited). She, and the hostess, came to check and make sure that our replacement vegetable dishes were to our satisfaction, and we were not charged for the dishes we had to send back. The restaurant is clearly in a learning phase, and as time goes on, they will undoubtedly refine their creative menu. Atmosphere (5/5): Cozy; if you've been to Toki Underground on H street or Izakaya Seki's downstairs room, that would be a good yardstick for the feel you get at Bad Saint. Great, diverse music selection, including classics from the Philippines and solid hip-hop, none of which was distracting or too loud. The sounds of the kitchen give it a nice din; at one point though, the whole place filled with smoke from some dish; we didn't mind (in fact the haze added to the atmosphere) but it might be an issue if patrons are prone to coughing/irritation. Overall, definitely worth a try. I'd like to come back here in several months and see how the place has evolved. More important than anything is the team, which looks attentive and  ready to learn.

4.5,5.0,"Visiting from Providence and came across Bad Saint. Amazing! Recommendations from our waitress led us to pick a perfect combo of dishes - with plenty of choices left for the next time! My friend and I shared a few plates and left full (and smiling). As you walk in you are transformed from the 11th St exterior into another world which belies what you see from the outside -- towering ceiling, beautiful wood panels, and cozy seats. Ukoy is a delicious blend of sweet potato, leek, yucca and tiny shrimp. The vinegar dipping sauce is a perfect compliment to the fritters. OMG the Inihaw Na Liempo was simply heaven  - rich but not overwhelming. You can eat with a fork, but we chose to eat with our hands :-)  The beef in Tapa is like a moist, thick jerky - really really tasty. The rice is drizzled with a bit of browned garlic and sesame. Save room for dessert! The bilo bilo is a perfect combo of lime, coconut milk rice pudding. Oh my goodness, it is orgasmic. I have to mention the drinks. My friend had the Willy Santos and happily downed it so quickly that I was thankful for the sip I snuck when it arrived. I am a wine drinker, and was surprised that there were only three wine choices -- but know that those choices were specially picked to be perfect with the Filipino menu. The Lambrusco is so so dry and light and bubbly. I also had the Txakolina which was so refreshing on a hot summer night. If they are busy, leave your name and grab a drink next door at Room 11 and they will text you when your table is ready.

4.5,5.0,"bad saint is SUPERB. from the interior/exterior design, to the service and, of course, the food, every last detail is simply fantastic. the ambiance - from the cozy view into the shop from the front bank of windows, to the warm woods, east Asian fabrics, Philippine basketry (I think it's from the Philippines?) to the iron-bar shelving, the lighting fixtures, family tchotchkes on the shelves and line of mahjong tiles bordering the window sill...the list goes on. The owners and design team that worked on the shop have completed a masterpiece - the end result is a warm, inviting and intimate ambiance that will keep you lingering long after dinner is over. BEAUTIFUL. We ate the pork belly - tender, melty, amazing. The shrimp fritters - crispy, crunchy - delicious! The chicken was cooked and seasoned to perfection and the lumpia with pork and cornichons (awesome combo!) was fantastic. I must also mention the desert - oh, the desert! I think it was a traditional rice pudding-esque treat with cooked peaches and lime zest...oh, man - simply delicious.

4.5,5.0,"We live in the neighborhood and had to try this place after hearing so much about it- were definitely not disappointed!  We arrived around 5:45-6ish on a Saturday night and were able to be seated right away (it was a rather rainy/cold night though, so this may have cut down on the crowd a bit). They placed us at a long bar-type area that ran along the side of the restaurant. It seemed small at first but with hooks under the counter for jackets/purses and a small shelf there was plenty of room, and we didn't feel cramped with other diners next to us which was nice. We split a bottle of the Txakolina wine, along with the Pancit, Ukoy, and Tapa- those three dishes were plenty of food for the two of us. The Tapa came first and was our favorite, definitely a must order!- greens, rice, soft boiled egg, and perfectly crispy beef. Next was the Ukoy (shrimp in a tempura-type breading with strands of sweet potatoes and leeks), and the Pancit (noodles with mushrooms/veggies) came last. All were served with a vinaigrette sauce on the side, which was slightly spicy and nice for dipping/pouring over the dishes. We were too full for dessert, but the people seated beside us seemed to really enjoy the pudding. Next time, we will definitely get the Tapa again, but want to try the Kinilaw (tuna) or Lumpiang Shanghai (eggrolls).

4.5,5.0,"Columbia Heights residents have been eagerly waiting for Bad Saint to open for a while now and they did so quietly on Friday. It's very small so my wife and I went  early Saturday night to beat the rush and we were so glad we did. We started off with the Lumpiang which were incredible. They're like a long skinny fried spring roll with beef, pork, and cornichon (the waitress said the cornichon was the chef's mother's secret ingredient) and they come with a chili vinegar dipping sauce. They were rich and flavorful with great bracing acidity from the vinegar. I could have eaten my body weight in those. We moved on to the rice noodles. They were deliciously salty and garlicky with lots of vegetables (Woodward mushrooms, baby zucchini) and little crunchy rice surprises. Next came the tuna jaw. It is half of the actual jawbone of a tuna so it was pretty big and you have to work to get the meat out of all the crevices of the bone but man is it worth it. The meat has different consistency in different parts of the bone--some parts flaky like salmon, other parts fatty and chewy like toro sushi or a rare steak. Finally we got the dried steak, which came with rice and a green salad. The rice was toasty ( I think there were nuts in it) and the herbs were a nice fresh foil for the salty beef. I tried two cocktails, both of which were excellent. The Balasong was rye-based and kind of reminded me of a more acidic boulevardier and the second was the Willy Santos made with coconut and banana cordials. 10/10 would dine again!",23,"Washington, DC",Bad Saint,Dominic O.,"Washington, DC",,/biz/bad-saint-washington
4.5,5.0,"I may have thrown a tantrum the night I discovered that my darling '3 Salsas' was no longer. I may have cried (no, ok, I did) at the sight of the shuttered storefront. I may have spent minutes (which turned into hours) googling and searching for an answer as to why my beloved was never more. How would I ever be able to replicate the food experiences I had with '3 Salsas' with any other place? I'd tried Taqueria DF and was terribly disappointed. But then, at the urging of my boyfriend, I decided to move on. After all, that decision was made for me with the last taco served by '3 Salsas.' Not far from the now-abandoned shell of the former '3 Salsas' lives Taqueria Habanero. Reluctantly, I tried Taqueria Habanero.Taqueria Habanero, I must say, makes an acceptable substitute. It makes a deliciously wonderful substitute. Their tacos (the pollo and pescado are my favorites) are phenomenal. The pollo, coated with some raw white onion and some cilantro, served in their homemade soft tortilla shells, rivals that of '3 Salsas.' Their pescado, however, is without a doubt my favorite taco in DC. Slices of avocado top a lightly fried white fish, drizzled with a sauce that almost tastes like it has a Thousand Island dressing base, though I may be missing the mark on that one. It's good. Real good. Pairs well.Their quesadillas are fried large tortillas, served with a side of a pico-style shredded lettuce. For the quesadilla, I've tried both the cheese option as well as the chorizo quesadilla. The latter, I must say, is a gluttonous greasy heaven. Not quite as good as a '3 Salsas' quesadilla, but one of the better options in DC.As for their side sauces (verde, roja, and their habanero), I recommend asking for at least one of each. Their verde (crisp, acidic, fresh) is my preferred sauce, though, the others are also quite good.I really like this place and recommend it for anyone who enjoys 'the flavors.'

4.5,3.0,"Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed with Taqueria Habanero.  My siblings and I were in Columbia Heights over the weekend and had some time to kill before attending an event.  We decided to check out this place due to the great reviews and our love for authentic tacos. While, they have the authenticity part down with the homemade tortilla and salsa, I just wasn't blown away with the flavor. The salsa they provided were both tasty.  They both had a smooth, liquid consistency. The red had a nice smoky kick to it and the green was cilantro based. The tacos are $2.50 each with the exception of seafood items being $3.  They're pretty small...about the size of my palm (I have little Asian hands). So, if you have a big appetite, I'd suggest ordering at least 4.  They do put a good size pile of meat on the tortilla though. I ordered al pastor and barbacoa tacos. I normally love al pastor, but wasn't impressed with this one.  It was pretty salty and had no sweetness to it at all, which is odd since the addition of pineapples normally does. The meat itself was also different - instead of tender pieces of pork, it looked and tasted more like chorizo. I'm pretty sure they just added pieces of pineapple to a chorizo mixture.  The barbacoa was tender and pretty again, but nothing spectacular. My sister also let me a try a piece of the grilled steak (bistec) and that was probably my favorite from the three meats. It had great flavor to it.My brother ordered a sopes and huaraches (I forgot what type of meat he got).  Both were also smaller than expected.  He enjoyed the sopes, but wasn't a huge fan of the huaraches.  More so a personal preference since he didn't like the slimy texture from the cactus. Overall, not a bad spot for authentic tacos.  But, they definitely execute some meats better than others...so gotta be selective.",140,"Washington, DC",Taqueria Habanero,Jennifer N.,"Chantilly, VA",2027227700,/biz/taqueria-habanero-washington

They could have been more generous on the servings!  LOLAll of the Tacos were well-seasoned and had me in BLISS with each bite.  Each unique in flavor and very ""poor-man"" friendly on the pockets at $2.50 each!  A word of warning: The tacos are practically amuse-bouches.  Is it legal to invoke a French term in a Taqueria review?...Oh well.  If famished, you might have to order a couple of tacos (as I always do) to satisfy your hunger because the portions were adequate but not overstuffed. Despite this point, just count on being in pure ""Buddha-stomach-rubbing gluttony"" and ready to be rolled out of there from enjoying some great eats.  One taste of these tacos and you'll understand.THE BOTTOM LINEIn all, 5 Stars across the board!  HANDS DOWN!....Taqueria Habanero serves up some of the best, authentic Mexican food that I have ever had in the entire DC area; including Maryland and Virginia.   Everything is fresh, full of flavor and made from scratch here.  And, nothing says fresh like an open kitchen...where the food is being prepared, fresh veggies/avocados are being sliced and the tortillas are hand-made to order...right in front of you!  How about that!?  I have nothing but great things to say about this place and the food.   The only thing I don't like is this place does not serve beer or alcohol; only standard bottled sodas and canned beverages are available.  I hope they get a liquor license soon.  I mean there is nothing like an iced cold Corona to wash down all that Taco"" flavor-poppin' goodness"" when you are having such a great foodie moment such as the one this place offers!  But hey.... when food is this good...a bottled coke and a smile will do!  This place is not about reinventing Mexican cuisines for the hipster/bar tribes that frequent the 14th ST. - Columbia Heights bar and restaurant scene.  Instead you get a true baseline of what real, traditional Mexican food flavor is all about....which can be used to compare to the likes of more upscale, trendy places such as Tico, Taco Bamba, Lauriol Plaza and Oyamel. -- at a 1/4th of the price! A MUST-TRY when you're in the city and craving some real, authentic Mexican food.  TIP: 1) Try the green and chipotle-based homemade sauces. They are addictive on the tacos and finger-licking good.  Last,  2) For those who are Vegetarian, there are veggie, cactus, and mushroom tacos available.",140,"Washington, DC",Taqueria Habanero,DON C.,"Washington, DC",2027227700,/biz/taqueria-habanero-washington
4.5,4.0,"Taqueria Habanero is very close to the friend's place that I was staying at, so I ran around the corner to grab lunch. I had read the excellent Yelp reviews before stopping in, and I could wait to try the tacos. I was seated right away, and my order was taken quickly. I went with a variety of tacos--one pollo, one camarones, and one pescado. I waited for probably half an hour for my three tacos to be ready. There were several other customers, but it wasn't that crowded for it to take so long for my order to be ready. If you're tight on time, I probably wouldn't recommend trying Taqueria Habanero.The wait, however, was well worth it. The star of the show was the pescado taco. It was so full of flavor!

4.5,4.0,"I'm in love with a huarache. Taqueria Habanero introduced to this tasty little item. The huarache with bistec is delicious. The masa tortilla is filled with refried black beans so it is a bit thicker than you expect but not overwhelmingly heavy. It is topped with avocado, steak, grated queso fresco, and grilled nopales (cactus) & onions. I ask for the grilled onion and cactus on the side because it allows me to control the portion. I like the cactus taste but not the lot that they pile on it. Is it hard to cut through? Maybe. It's substantial so don't be the outsider with your taco-eating friends, the huarache CAN be in your hands too!I'm glad I tried this on my second visit because I wasn't incredibly impressed by their tacos.

They are so much better than many of the mediocre places we've all accepted as ""pretty good"" that you're almost shocked something so simple can taste so good.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking to get a taco fix going.A few other notes - the ambiance, like most taco shops in DC, is nothing special. This isn't a take a girl on a date spot. It's a lets get some effin' tacos and then go to Red Derby for a beer type of spot. That said, compared to some of their competition, it's actually a nice and clean spot that feels like they take that sort of thing seriously.  Staff are friendly, but generally really busy, so don't expect a ton of great service.Taco highlights for me were the shrimp and the al pastor.  Bonus points for serving Mexican Coca-Colas.",140,"Washington, DC",Taqueria Habanero,Derek H.,"Washington, DC",2027227700,/biz/taqueria-habanero-washington

This place happened to be within walking distance of her home and OMG was it a pleasant surprise. I had seen the awesome yelp reviews, but the group I guided to this place was a littleeeee skeptical about my life choices as we walked up to the restaurant front. The restaurant was hopping when we got there so we had to wait a few minutes for a table, no big deal. The tacos, OMG the tacos. So many options for vegan / vegetarian.

4.5,5.0,"Definitely go with a Huarache. They're on a thicker, fried (but not greasy) tortilla and have delicious cactus (which could substitute as meat!) as a topping. (They're basically a filled-out version of the smaller tacos, on a better tortilla). The tacos were also delicious, and provide variation if you can't decide on a meat, or want to try some different types before you commit to your choice a Huarache. Fish taco was a favorite. Someone at the table also had the chipotle shrimp plate and thought it was great, though I didn't personally try it.  It looked delicious.Try the green sauce! It's so good.  Re: portions: I had a huarache and couldn't have eaten more. My husband had a huarache and two tacos, and was satisfied, but could have eaten more (he says).

I had the chicken enchiladas with the green chile sauce, rice, and beans. Each part of the dish was excellent, flavorful, yet not overly heavy (though I have no doubt it wasn't healthy). The lengua tacos were crispy yet tender and flavorful.  The tinga poblano taco is really well seasoned and tender -- transformative for a chicken taco.  The pescado taco was perfect and not fried.  All of the tortillas bend and hold together -- they don't crack and aren't dry like the tortillas at most places.  The quesadilla is crispy on the outside, almost like a Vietnamese crepe.  The rice and beans are authentic and delicious.  I can't wait to come back. It can be about a 20 min wait for take out but since it's all made fresh and is delicious I really can't complain.  It is a little hot in the restaurant, especially in the summer as there isn't much ventilation so I recommend takeout.",140,"Washington, DC",Taqueria Habanero,Erica L.,"Columbia Heights, Washington, DC",2027227700,/biz/taqueria-habanero-washington

Taqueria Habanero lives up to the hype. Al pastor is excellent, though I'd like to have an actual slice of pineapple on my taco. The carne asada is also good, though the last time I went it was on the dry side. Handmade tortillas are delicious. They did not give me enough of the delicious salsa, though.My vegan friend loved her mushroom taco, though we had to clear up an ordering snafu when she received a meat taco. The S.O. did not think his chicken torta was up to snuff, but that might be because he ordered a torta at a taqueria. Service needs work.

4.5,3.0,"Is this place cheap? Yes. Is this place authentic? Yes, it's not a rehash of taco bell. Are the tacos here delicious? Well, it certainly offers one of the best deals in the city $2.50 for a taco, it's not a great deal if you consider the overall taste and meat/tortilla portion. While the tacos are okay, it doesn't give you that WOW or OMG factor which makes you want to come back over and over again.  This review is solely based on the tacos since that's all I ordered.  My friend and I both ordered the barbacoa, fish, and shrimp tacos.  I love barbacoa because the meat takes time to cook and it's made in a special way that really packs the flavor.  Unfortunately, the barbacoa here doesn't have much flavor. It's also rather tough.  The fish and shrimp tacos were alright but again lacks much flavor.  It's a decent taco joint and they do good business, especially the hipster and yuppy crowd.

Craving tacos on a Friday night,  I decided to swing by this place after reading great reviews in a variety of places.  I was disappointed to see meat options only on their menu but upon inspection of their reviews was pleased to discover they offer fish,  shrimp and two kinds of veggie tacos,  cactus and mushroom). I ordered three veggie tacos,  two fish,  two shrimp,  a side of rice,  beans and guacamole.  My total came out to $36. They threw in some chips as well. Time from ordering to waking back out the door was about 25 mins. The servers were super friendly and the place was packed,  at one point there was even a wait. They took my order and I paid, unlike some of the other local taco joints,  they take card. We ate the food at home. All of the tacks were absolutely delicious.  These consisted of two stacked corn tortillas,  protein,  cilantro and a chipotle sauce. The rice was tasty,  but a little chewy.  The beans were your typical black beans -  but good.  The guacamole was absolutely on point.

4.5,5.0,"As a Mexican-born Houstonian in DC, it's annoying to go to ""Mexican"" restaurants that serve pico de gallo as salsa. This is no Monterrey, but they encapsulate the essence of central Mexican cuisine. I ordered the tacos de nopalitos and the huaraches (!!) with a tamarind jarritos. The tacos come in the traditional double tortilla style. Tortillas can make or break a dish, and they were the perfect size and texture- they didn't break apart. If there's too much filling, separate the tortillas and turn them into two little tacos. Huaraches are so rare to find in the states in my experience, which is unfortunate because the masa based dish with goodies on the top is delicious! Everything tasted fresh and like home. Our server was very accommodating, always checking in on us and gladly explained the differences between the four salsas they had when brought to us. I recommend putting a little of all of them on everything... if you're adventurous. The setting was simple- nothing fancy. Tables placed closely with one another, not uncomfortably. They added a more intimate vibe. If the restaurant has a mix of Spanish and English in the air, it's likely the real deal, like this one. I'll definitely be back.",140,"Washington, DC",Taqueria Habanero,Brenda G.,"Washington, DC",2027227700,/biz/taqueria-habanero-washington

Chips and dressings were fine--you can always tell fresh, homemade guacamole.  The service really needs some work, though.  Perhaps they were understaffed, but our orders were mixed up, the people next to us had to find the waitress to get their's sorted out, and our drink order was forgotten.  Nice folks but a little chaotic, so don't be in a hurry--the food here is worth waiting for.",140,"Washington, DC",Taqueria Habanero,Jack K.,"West McLean, VA",2027227700,/biz/taqueria-habanero-washington

My one and only complaint is that one end of one out of three of my enchiladas was slightly saltier than I'd have liked. The servers are the sweetest. So nice.

4.5,5.0,"3.5 stars, which I round up to 4 because of the friendliness and the great prices.  I have hated Mexican food for as long as I can remember, as my typical experience has been tasteless burritos/tacos doused with beans and fake cheese.  Anyways, I had some amazing tacos while visiting friends and family in Cincinnati, and I had been craving fish tacos ever since.Well I found this place on yelp, and it turned out to be really close to my place.  I've had the following- quesadilla al pastor (pork)- taco lengua (beef tongue)- fish tacos- carne asada taco- another pork taco I can't rememberI thought that the tacos were decent.  They had good flavor, but they're not the best tacos I've ever had.  The taco lengua had a texture that wasn't my favorite - I'm not unadventurous with food and flavors - but I didn't really care for the lengua.  It tasted like poorly cooked pork belly (rubbery). The fish tacos had a really nice flavor.  The carne asada was tasty but not tender.  The pork taco was good, and the quesadilla was good.  The al pastor type of pork was actually my favorite meat.  That said, I found fault with all of them. A minor fault - yes - but it was maddening since each taco was *so* close to being really really good.  Maybe I'm being high maintenance.Overall, I think they can do a better job with the veggies or the slaw in the tacos.  And add more filling.  Granted, each taco is only $2.50, so I can't complain about the price or value.  But personally I'd rather pay more to get more ""stuffing"" in my taco, than order a lot of little tacos with little filling.  (I like a meat to tortilla ratio where there is more meat).  I would also pay more money for better quality meat.That said - these are still the best tacos I've had in DC.  Maybe I haven't explored enough or maybe tacos in DC aren't that great.  For that reason - I will definitely come back here.*update*Since my first visit, I've been half a dozen times.  My first visit must have been an off night, as the taco quality had much improved. I now rate this place 4.5 stars, rounded to 5.  My favorites are the fish tacos, barbacoa, carnitas, and the grilled beef.  Also - get the cactus - but be forewarned, if it's your first time, your stomach might protest a little.  It has a very nice flavor though, so I think it's worth it.",140,"Washington, DC",Taqueria Habanero,Dagny T.,"Washington, DC",2027227700,/biz/taqueria-habanero-washington

There is usually this one guy who works the register and ""greets"" you upon arrival. I say ""greet"" in quotes because what usually happens is I walk in and he hands us the menus and says ""Do you know what you want""? No ""Hi, welcome"" and you usually have to ask for water and chips and salsa. And then they only give you about 10 chips. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH THAT? And then please don't ask for more chips/salsa because they will most definitely charge you. I also have a deep strong love for guacamole and I usually call to make sure they have some because they usually don't have any or are being very stingy with it for what reason, I don't understand since everyone knows that ""guac is extra"" and I most definitely plan on paying for it!

4.5,4.0,"Cyndy's Bottom Line:  Excellently prepared authentic hand made Mexican food.If you want delightful delicious, flavorful Mexican food this is the best in the city!  Everything is made with fresh ingredients which makes the food so very delicious.Hubby had the tacos made of beef tongue, carnitas, and chorizo.  The tortillas are hand made to order.  Literally made when you order.  The tacos are plated with diced onions, cilantro, slices of radish and cucumbers and served with lime slices.  They serve coca-cola Mexicana too.I ordered the platos especiales - enchiladas de pollo (verses or rojas) rolled in a corn tortilla filled with chicken covered with your choice of red or green sauce and topped with grated cheese and served with black beans and rice.The entire plate was absolutely mouthwatering delicious!  Amazing flavors!Upon my first bite my tastebuds were singing!  There are three enchiladas that are neatly rolled up.  The chicken filling is shredded and there is a good amount of flavorful sauce throughout.  I had the red sauce and it was flavorful with the right amount of spiciness and heat.  The rice was the best I've had.  Love the flavor!  The black beans were so yummy too.  Again the flavors were so robust!There is a condiment tray of sauces and the pickled onions. Loved the pickled onions!  The pickled flavor with the spiciness and heat was so addictive delicious.  It went extremely well with the enchiladas. The word is out and the line is forming.  Bring cash.",140,"Washington, DC",Taqueria Habanero,Cyndy K.,"Falls Church, VA",2027227700,/biz/taqueria-habanero-washington

I would say seating gets limited fast on a busy hour. I ordered 4 different tacos and a bottle of water up at the counter. Service is straight forward and polite. I promptly found a seat at one of the empty tables. Ten minutes in and my order was served up and ready to go with home made sauces. The tacos were well constructed, authentic, and flavorful. The added choice of sauces add a spicy element if desired.

4.5,4.0,"I love the small dining experience, friendly service, and of course, tacos! I ordered 3 tacos (carnitas, barbecue, and tinga poblano) and was a little disappointed in the small size when they arrived at the table. What they lacked in size they made up for in quality. Every type of meat I ordered was fantastic and you couldn't go wrong with any of the choices of meat on the menu and the corn tortillas were excellent as well. 3 tacos is a good amount to start with but you may need to order more if your stomach is running on empty. They also provide great chips and salsa at the table while you wait.I also ordered the huaraches with al pastor. It was kinda like a tostada filled with black beans and topped with your choice of meat and sauteed cactus leaves (my first time eating cactus). It was really good but the tostada like bottom was extremely difficult to cut through and made it a challenge to get a bite of food in my mouth.

The no lemon/lime slice given was just absent minded.  I asked for ice and a lime slice again and they provided it.  I had the ""hueraches"" with carne asada.  It was an okay concept for a dish: a papusa like base with slices of carne asada, cactus, mexican cheese, and onions.  It was okay tasting, but for $8.50 it was not enough.  They should at least give you two hueraches.  I didn't bother ordering more because my instinct was telling it was not worth it here.I was disappointed.  I don't plan to be back.",140,"Washington, DC",Taqueria Habanero,Dylan R.,"Washington, DC",2027227700,/biz/taqueria-habanero-washington

I had three tacos- al pastor, barbacoa, and carne asada. I also ordered a side of Mexican rice. The tacos were perfect, I would say they are up to par to the tacos I have had in California. They make fresh corn tortillas in-house. The Mexican rice though was a little short of its tacos. Out of impulse my housemate and I also tried their churros.

The tacos were well seasoned. My favorites were the al pastor and shrimp. Tortilla are made in house as well and taste pretty official. They also have 4 different sauces to add to your meal as you please. The habanero sauce, verde sauce, and spicy pickled onions were all wonderful additions to add to my taco. Didn't care much for the chipotle sauce. Reason why I gave it 4 stars was they were out of carnitas, salsa, and guacamole. Which was a bummer but other than that food and service was a1.

I´m going get the positive out of the way and say that the food was excellent. I ordered the Chicken Enchilada. It was Chicken covered in red sauce with rice and black beans on the side. Delicious and very filling.The reason I´m not givng Taqueria Habanero a five star ranking is because the service was lackluster. The food took a while to come, around 20 to 30 minutes. The restaurant was full so I can understand why, it was the lunch hour after all.  But another instance of lackluster service was that after we were pretty loud about hour friend´s birthday, the employees didn´t do anything about it. Usually if a restaurant even hears a whisper that it is your birthday they come out with a whole group of waiters singing happy birthday and stuff like that. No one did that even after we sang happy birthday to my friend, so I felt like we were pushed aside from their attention as soon as our food arrived.That is a small complaint to a good restaurant however and their delicious food made me forget quickly.",140,"Washington, DC",Taqueria Habanero,Sam I.,"Baldwin, MD",2027227700,/biz/taqueria-habanero-washington

It wasn't on the menu, but the owner told me they have it on Wednesdays and Thursdays (not sure if it'll stay that way or if they have it on weekends too). Super happy this place opened in the neighborhood. I actually like Taqueria Districto Federal a lot, but nice to have an alternative.

Chips great--not overly greasy.  Some of the salsas were a bit too hot for me but perfect for my husband, which is pretty consistent for us.  We've eaten the fish, chorizo, carnitas, and al pastor tacos, all of which were excellent. The al pastor was probably the least favorite for each of us as it was a bit dry and not super flavorful, but far from bad.

The menu is good enough and simple with really inexpensive options. I went for the tongue tacos and it was delicious!!!! All six of them! The beverage options are a bit limited. I'm a diet coke kind of guy, but they have other more authentic choices. Honestly, it was nice to try something different. The atmosphere is great and, at least to me, just a couple of blocks away from home.

4.5,4.0,"Ordered 3 tacos (chicken, chicken tinga, and al pastor) Hubby also had 3 tacos (al pastor, and other beefish options I don't remember) and we split the hueraches. The tinga and al pastor tacos were both good. I favored the tinga over the pastor bc it tasted too pork-y. (I eat some cuts of pork, but don't like when it tastes too pork-y. Hubby really liked the taste of the al pastor since he doesn't have quirky food issues.) The huaraches was ok. It was kinda like a tostada filled with black beans and topped with your choice of meat (chicken for us) and sauteed cactus leaves. Not bad, but the tostada-esque part was really hard to cut and I lose interest and patience when I have to work too hard to eat. Food should want to meet my mouth, not play hard to get... We also had an orange/strawberry agua fresca which was a nice, lightly sweet compliment to the meal. Our friends both had the enchiladas rojo, which were pretty good from the one forkful I was permitted. They weren't playing games and smashed their food.

4.5,5.0,"My new favorite tacos in the city since the relocation/demise of Taqueria Nacionale.The tortillas are pretty remarkable on their own: fresh, hot, perfect texture, and flavorful. Of the tacos I've sampled thus far, I've had no disappointments.The standout is the chicken tinga: juicy, deliciously seasoned. I've yet to find a taco in the city that would compete. The al pastor, barbacoa, carnitas, bistec and pollo are all solid as well (listed in rough order of preference). I'm a huge tomatillo salsa fan, and their green stuff does not disappoint! It's tangy, and the fresh herb taste is powerful and delicious.I've only had takeout (and delivery via postmates), but the seating area looked pleasant - I'll try it out one of these days. The woman taking my order was pleasant and spoke English beyond the perfunctory ordering terminology, always a plus for those of us with subpar Spanish skills that feel a lite awkward at the likes of Distrito Federal sometimes.Bottom line: best new taco place on the DC scene, with quality ingredients and authentic flavor.",140,"Washington, DC",Taqueria Habanero,Todd M.,"Washington, DC",2027227700,/biz/taqueria-habanero-washington

Half of our group ordered the chicken enchiladas and they disappeared faster than our tacos did. For the spice lovers at the table, everyone was a fan of the spicy orange sauce and milder green sauce that is available on request (the spice tray also included pickled onions and another sauce). With great service, delicious food and the proximity to Red Derby and Lyman's tavern (the restaurant doesn't have a liquor license, not sure if they have applied for one), we'll definitely be coming back for more tacos and enchiladas!",140,"Washington, DC",Taqueria Habanero,Melissa C.,"Washington, DC",2027227700,/biz/taqueria-habanero-washington

They were double wrapped in thin tortilla shells (not the thick papusas you get at a lot of other places) with meat and a little mix of vegetables on top and not too spicy.  Plus they have great green salsa.  If you like tacos, you should definitely try this place.",140,"Washington, DC",Taqueria Habanero,Scott C.,"Washington, DC",2027227700,/biz/taqueria-habanero-washington

4.5,5.0,"Instantly became my favorite mexican food establishment. The garlic shrimp (cant remember the exact name) was just absolutely incredible. Really everything we had was phenomenal! Went with one other person and intentionally ordered far more food then we could possibly eat so we would have leftovers and so we could try as much as possible. Ultimately we stuffed our faces and finished maybe half of what we ordered, which was 12 tacos and 2 entrees. Armed with a healthy amount of leftovers we asked for the bill which almost seems like a typo as it came to under $50. Remember we are in DC! I wouldn't have blinked if it had been double that as it was certainly worth it. One tip for visitors, do what I did and order the largest array of food that you can afford. They saved extremely well and were 95% as good the next night. Everything was so good in its own unique way, the flavors were unique and rich in literally every case. If your the type of person who knows what they like and wants to order just that, your in luck as well! All the flavors were complex and strong enough that if you ordered 6 of the same tacos you wouldn't get sick of them or bored by them half way in as you might at most places. Thus, Id give it a sixth star if I could. Bonus, their clearly hand made drinks were so damn good, and once they get their liquor license I bet they will be making top notch cocktails!",140,"Washington, DC",Taqueria Habanero,James W.,"Bethesda, MD",2027227700,/biz/taqueria-habanero-washington

4.5,5.0,"Holy cow, I'm so in love.Typically I don't frequent food trucks. Few have vegetarian options and most are overpriced for either the quality or quantity of food (sometimes both). However, Basil Thyme had three different options, and all of them looked fantastic. Admittedly, when I saw the cost my eyebrows shot up and I almost walked away. But a co-worker owed me lunch and strongly recommended them. Basil Thyme has the option to mix'n'match their lasagnas so I chose the most obvious of the vegetarian meals, ""Maria"", and something more exotic. It's my personal preference to always order the most representative and popular food items when I try a new food vendor. If a taco, hamburger, or what-have-you isn't worthwhile I'm cautious about getting something more adventurous. Especially since when I think of American-esque Italian restaurants I tend to think of incredibly bland or lackluster meals. The Maria lasagna IS basic, but their portioning of zucchini, cheese, and spices feels original. If the sauce was ever canned it's not obvious. Their current special is a butternut squash lasagna with just the barest hint of cinnamon and sweetness. The goat cheese is surprisingly mild and fantastic. I expected the flavors to be overwhelming or too rich, but with a half serving it was just perfect. Not only that but that combination of flavors isn't something you  normally crave during the summer, but it complements their ""Maria"" lasagna really well. Both lasagnas were well cooked and just the right level of warm when handed off to me. There was no excessive grease, no burnt ends, and no lukewarm spots in the middle. On the side was a spring mix salad with a light splash of dressing. My co-worker pointed out that they have a combo option where for an additional dollar (one. dollar) you can get a drink and dessert. For a DC lunch the price, combo or not, is fairly strong. There's plenty of restaurants and trucks selling at the same price point with less food or with less quality in their servings. For vegetarians in particular; the options are slim and sometimes we're charged as much or more for a scant meal.  With Basil Thyme, I could easily eat half of the entree and all my salad, then eat the second half the next day.

4.5,4.0,"On my recent trip to DC, I was near L'Enfant Plaza. Basil Thyme was out front one day and I decided to try some lasagna. I'm a big meat eater but sometimes opt for vegetarian options if the flavors sound good. On this particular day, I decided to try the Giuseppe - black truffle lasagna with portobellos and gorganzola. the lasagna comes with a salad. I upgraded to a combo which added a drink and cannoli for a total of $13 or so after tax. The portions seemed small to me. I was mistaken. I could only eat half my lunch that day. The lasagna was hearty and flavored well. The black truffle and portabellos were right on point. The gorganzola was not overwhelming, which I appreciated. The dish was dense and filling. The salad that came with it was forgettable as was the cannoli.

Although it was also the most expensive, it was definitely worth paying the extra few bucks for the quality of this food truck. I ordered the Linda (traditional) lasagna with the side salad. And for the extra dollar, it was hard to resist making it a combo and adding both a cannoli and a soda.The lasagna itself was fantastic, one of the best I've ever had. Granted, I don't order lasagna very often, but still, I can't remember one in the recent past that was better than this one. It was soft and literally melted in your mouth. Not over- or under-cooked in the slightest. I'm not sure if you can describe lasagna as being tender but that is what it was. The salad that accompanied it was very good, not amazing but I did appreciate its uniqueness (tiny cucumbers, sliced cheese, and uncommon dressing) in comparison to most food truck salads. I didn't particularly care for the cannoli though. The cream was sweet and tasty but the shell was bland and crumbled easily.

4.5,3.0,"A good food truck marred by unfortunate inconsistency.On a good day the lasagna from here is quite good: the noodles have a pleasant toothyness, the sauce isn't so thick as to drown the noodles, and the cheese is nicely melted.  On a bad day the lasagna is quite bad: the noodles are chewy, the sauce too thick and the cheese sits cold on top of the slice.The variation is due both to randomness in the construction of the lasagna (i.e. varying amounts of sauce) and how much the truck heats up a given slice.  The latter seems fixable but has persisted.  The former is mystifying.  I expect some inconsistency in food trucks due to the hurried and packed nature of the truck.  But the lasagna is prepared ahead of time so the actual lasagna shouldn't be a problem.  Yet it is.As you can tell, I'm risk-averse for lunch.  For the prices charged (and the relative lack of difficulty in pre-made lasagna), consistency is a requirement.",240,"Washington, DC",Basil Thyme,David M.,"Washington, DC",8555887282,/biz/basil-thyme-washington

The special of the day also sounded amazing and I loved that each lasagna came with a side salad (so I could pretend it was somewhat healthy).

I loved both of them and luckily I did not have you choose because they have half and half orders!In the end I settled on a half and half order with the special and Lisetta, a side salad and made it a combo, so I also received a drink (bottle of water) and cannoli!

I decided on the butternut squash with goat cheese because I've never had lasagna like that. All I can say is WOW. I'd hit up Basil Thyme every week if I ate carbs like that! You gotta try this variety. The lasagna noodles were cooked perfectly and I loved the extra chunks of butternut squash on top. I can't believe I'm so in love with squash. Anywho, I got the combo for $1 more which includes a drink and a cannoli. I opted for a bottled water and the cannoli of the day was pumpkin. I'm not even a huge fan of pumpkin, but I tried it. The flavor was great and it wasn't too sweet. I DID have to save it for the next day since the lasagna was very filling. So, there it is. Try the Basil Thyme truck.

4.5,5.0,"As a certified FOB, I had my first taste of lasagna in the second grade during St. Timothy's Catholic School's once-a-month lasagna lunch day in the early nineties. I was instantly hooked. I finally understood why Garfield would risk his relationship with Jon and Odie just to get a bite of his favorite dish. Ever since then, Stouffer's Family Style lasagna has been in regular rotation in my household...and a few times when my mom was feeling super adventurous she would make it from scratch (I still preferred that good old Stouffer's though).Flash forward to now. I had my first taste of Basil Thyme's amazing lobster lasagna at one of Kristin's Yelp events a few years back and my eyes immediately rolled to the back of my head. This stuff put my beloved Stouffer's to shame. The tomato sauce was thick and robust...it actually TANTALIZED my taste buds. This ain't no Ragu! The lobster bits only took the lasagna to the next level. To quote Drake: ""You fancy huh?"" I mean I'm pretty sure only Sultans and Khaleesi's get to enjoy lobster in their lasagna but here was I eating it like a regular joe off some DC corner street. I've been thinking about this lasagna for years now but haven't had a chance to reunite with this food truck until a recent run in at Franklin Square. I was immediately intrigued by their gluten free lasagna made with eggplant noodles. As soon as I ordered it, the owner Bryan (Hi Bryan F!!!) warned me it was more like a loose casserole and asked me to reconsider one of his other dishes. I decided to take the plunge and couldn't be more happier. The eggplant was delicious and it had all of the wonderful sauce, cheese, and tender loving care that his other dishes had. I did not miss the carbs at all and I didn't feel like a ten ton brick after eating this. Gluten free, vegetarian, AND delicious?

4.5,5.0,"Basil Thyme embodies everything good about food trucks: delicious food that's reasonably priced, served fast by friendly people.Today marks my third visit here, and I honestly took one bite of my meal before becoming unable to wait to write this review. I have tried the cremini mushroom ravioli with dill & garlic cream sauce; the chicken & spinach ravioli, and the beurre blanc sauce with shrimp. All were around $12  (or less, if without a protein) and came with a large side salad that's actually worth mentioning: super fresh mixed greens topped with carrots, cucumber, roasted red peppers, and parm shavings. Regarding portion size (see photo), I have yet to finish an entire plates' worth of food in one lunch, despite its deliciousness. My shrimp pasta, for example, came with at least 6 robustly-sized shrimp... BT definitely doesn't try and skimp to stretch their product, unlike a lot of other food trucks. And even with a line at noon, I've only waited 3 minutes at most after ordering to receive my plate, unlike a lot of other food trucks.It took me awhile to try this truck because I was foolishly hesitant to pay for simple pasta.... oh how wrong I was. The pastas are, to my knowledge, all made fresh from scratch, just like the sauces. Every dish I've had has been better than many pasta dishes I've had in restaurants for which I've paid almost double the price. I frequently make my own pasta sauces from scratch at home, again making me hesitant to pay $12, but BT's chef makes sauces I couldn't dream of making this good. And there are enough on the semi-rotating menu that even having visited thrice, I've still got at least two I haven't yet tasted.To top it all off, the guy taking orders is friendly, knowledgeable about the food he's serving and more than happy to explain menu items or help you decide.

4.5,5.0,"I've been eating at food trucks all my life.  Growing up in Hawai'i we have what we call Manapua Man trucks that sell chinese bakery items, candy, sodas, fried noodles, burgers, etc etc.  My point in telling you this is that I am by no means a foodie snob.  I know some people who will NEVER try a food truck because they are....well, they're freakin' nuts.So, I was on the street today after going to the bank and decided to walk over to Metro Center to see if any of the food trucks were out yet (it was about 11:15am).  As I looked up 12th Street, I saw the row of trucks and as my eyes went from one to the next, I spotted IT - the silver truck with green lettering that I had been stalking for the last few weeks...BASIL THYME!  I initially learned of this trucks' existence while walking past it one day on my way to a meeting and the smells coming out of it made me salivate.  I tucked it away in my memory bank and had been waiting for it to be in the area again ever since.I walked up to the truck and there were no other customers.  The truck owner, Brian, greeted me and asked if I had dined with them before.  I told him I had not and asked for his suggestion after telling him I like tomato sauce.  He said I should try the Linda since I was a BT Newbie.  And then I spotted GOAT CHEESE on the menu and told him I like goat cheese - he told me I should try the Guiseppe - Butternut Squash Lasagna with Goat Cheese & Sage because it would be soon going out of season.  He told me I would absolutely love it, and HE WAS RIGHT!!!!!The lasagnas are $9 each, but for ONE DOLLAR MORE you get a salad, a canoli & a canned soda.  Let me break down the dining experience.  When I first opened the container, I was somewhat disappointed by the size of the lasagna (don't judge me for being a size queen) as it appeared rather small, but by the time I was done with it and the salad - I was more than satisfied.  So much so that I couldn't finish the banana cream canoli.The salad was very fresh & the dressing was very, very tasty.  Brian stated it was made with sauteed shallots, which you could definitely taste.  It was garnished with large slices of grated parm, roasted pepper (LOVE), kalamata olives, cherry tomatoes & cucumbers.  I wish I had a tad bit more dressing, but I loved the salad.The Guiseppe lasagna.  Pasta was perfect and the amount of goat cheese and squash ratio was too.  Very very tasty.  I sprinkled some Tabasco on the top - SO GOOD!Let me say, I am not a fan of canolis.  I would not have ordered it as a separate menu item.  The crust was very good and not at all soggy or soft.  The banana cream filling was great and not too sweet.This food truck gets five stars from me not just because of the great food but also because of the great service.  Brian was personable, friendly and willing to explain the menu and he also stated that the wait time for the food is never long, which other reviewers have vouched for.  I will definitely dine with the BT crew again!!!  MAHALO!",240,"Washington, DC",Basil Thyme,Napualokelani K.,"Woodbridge, VA",8555887282,/biz/basil-thyme-washington
4.5,4.0,"Four and a half stars. While I've had much better Italian grub at a sit-down restaurant, @BasilThymeDC is definitely topping the savory end of my food truck list so far. These guys are serving up a better lasagna out of a vehicle than the brick'n'mortar Italian eatery they parked down the block from in Van Ness.I scurried out of the office on an unapproved break time before noon with the intention of getting the Pasquale (you had me intrigued at multiple meats). But the owner was cheerful and outspoken about recommending the Lisetta, one of two options on the menu that hadn't been listed online. The dude's confidence and enthusiasm could've sold me the pants off my rear end. Always ready to try someone else's favorite, I ordered the Lisetta combo and booked it back before anyone missed me.Home cooking that's served fast, super warm, and in resilient plastic bags. Lucky me, I got a corner piece-- what I lost in overall volume, I gained in double the sexy edge crust. Lisetta lasagna was just what I was craving from a carb fix: tasty pulled pork, cheesy surface, nicely cooked pasta, and plenty saucy without drowning the takeout box. I am more ashamed that I paid with a roll of quarters, than by the fact that I looked like a bearded Irishman after licking the ricotta-mingled sauce clean.Both side salad and pasta were topped by generous shavings of Parm. Greens were fresh and the salad was good, roasted red bell peppers, olives, thinly sliced cucumbers, grape tomatoes, kalamata olives, and mixed greens tossed in a light vinaigrette. I'm not a cannoli fan, but I got some nice crunch and thankfully it wasn't overbearingly sweet. The smattering of chocolate chips at the open ends added a few decadent accents to the mild pastry dough, and kept the ricotta filling from rubbing off too much on the foil.I'll be hitting their truck when they return next month if I'm still working in the neighborhood... though I'd probably aim to get just the pasta and salad.",240,"Washington, DC",Basil Thyme,Ruth C.,"Washington, DC",8555887282,/biz/basil-thyme-washington

4.5,1.0,"I am thoroughly disappointed and unsatisfied.I was excited to try Basil Thyme. My coworker has said good things and the reviews here on yelp are extraordinaire. However, I gladly fall off the bandwagon. Considering the high reviews I figured this truck would have a line but I was the first to approach. Despite this, I had to wait for a man to address all the specials which included a $17 lobster lasagna. $17, call me a cheapo but I will not spend that much for a mediocre lunch from a truck. I opted for the ""Linda"" which is their traditional lasagna with beef and red sauce. I always like trying the classics first, you can't go wrong with the classic. Finally when the man was done giving his speech I was able to order, then I was lost in translation because I thought he mumbled the words ""combo"" and I was like yeah of course sure because I, mistakenly, thought combo included the salad however what he said was ""cannoli"" so I ended up getting the cannoli. I start pulling out $11 but he goes no no it's $13.20 and I'm so startled and confused and there was a line building up behind me I didn't contest. I really should stand up more, my fault. Walking back to my office I was still confused about the price. Then I realized the ""cannoli"" (which on the way home I thought was free bread) was an extra $1 plus silly ol' tax. I'm use to other trucks including tax in their price, which seems more fair, but it is what it is. I was also confused why my styrofoam tray felt like a feather, did they forget my lasagna?Anyways, $13.20 for cold lasagna, a few pieces of lettuce, and a unsweetened cannoli, no thank you, never again. The lasagna was nothing special at all. And I'm not being harsh. What little bit of beef that they call ""angus beef"", cold sauce, and flatten mushed lasagna I am so disappointed. Especially since I got tricked into getting a cannoli and ended up paying $13.20 for mediocre food. For $13 you can make an entire tray of grass-fed organic beef lasagna I kid you not.

The Floridian wasn't around and Basil Thyme was. I guess it was ""Thyme"" to try the rookie of the bunch.They seemed to be having some technical difficulties with their air conditioner which held up the line. I heard the guy say this was their 3rd day out and ""sorry for the inconvenience"" while they get their stuff together. So this was their 3rd day out, this was my 3rd time eating from a food truck, and I was third in line. Hmmm.The menu claims that everything is made from scratch. They offer two types of lasagna, a meat lasagna with salami, pepperoni, and prosciutto. And a vegi-materian. They also have noodles like spaghetti. No garlic bread though. Ordering an entree cost $8. Add a can of pop and dessert like tira misu and it's $10. That's actually not bad. What was bad was the wait time. I must have waited for around 12-15 minutes. That's like a hundred years in Food Truck life. I guess we'll chalk it down to rookie-ism. They'll probably get better.Let's talk about taste. The little side salad that came with my 4X5 chunk of lasagna was meh. It was more of a garnish. The lasagna itself was actually quite good. The salami and pepperoni really did taste like they were home-made. I didn't notice the prosciutto. The sauce tasted fresh and homely as well. The whole thing was kind of loose. It was not made like the lasagna that I'm used to, held together by cottage, mozzarella or ricotta cheeses. A nice touch was that it was topped with thick shreds of parmesan. So the food was good.

4.5,2.0,"Party foul numero uno: giving someone who ordered a vegetarian dish somethin meaty instead. I'm not a vegetarian on the real but they didnt know that. I tried to get the maria which apparently comes with squash and sweet corn but they gave me a meat lasagna instead. Automatic strikeout in my book. Especially when you're a food truck and I had walked far enough away when I sat down to eat before I realized they gave me the wrong thing. The cheese was overly rubbery and the sausage was under-flavored. The lemonade was too sweet. The side salad was decent. Oreo cannoli sucked. Fried dough and flavorless. The combo cost me $14 which was expensive for bland food. I feel bad being this whiny but I would not go back and would not advise anyone to try it. Response to Brian F's comment:- There was no one else in line when I ordered so there should be no excuse for giving me the wrong entree. Especially when it is something so significant as a meat vs. veggie option after I had specifically asked for a veggie dish- I have the choice to spend my money at any number of food establishments. If I have a terrible experience there is no chance that I would go back and spend money there again so yes, I do have the confidence to rate Basil Thyme 2 stars. I am allowed my individual opinion in spite of 'overwhelmingly positive reviews'- My issue is not just with giving me the wrong meal, it was the overall lack of quality in the food I tasted and the customer service.- You do not have a customer friendly attitude sir",240,"Washington, DC",Basil Thyme,Alice L.,"Oakland, CA",8555887282,/biz/basil-thyme-washington
4.5,4.0,"I'm not going to lie...I really miss the Basil Thyme pasta truck. But, the lasagna truck remains on the streets and they're putting out some pretty good lasagna.It's actually been a while since I've been to their lasagna truck - tried them again this past Thursday since it's close to fall and they are again featuring their butternut squash, goat cheese, and sage lasagna - my favorite that they offer. The owner of the truck was outside the truck, taking orders personally and chatting with the patrons in line. I asked for no red peppers with my salad, and he happily obliged. My lasagna was cooked well, nicely al dente. The goat cheese was very fresh, with chunks of butternut squash weaved in. Only compliant? The portion was a bit smaller than I remember, but that could be just my eyes playing tricks on me. It was filling - definitely no need for a snack later on. At $12 (most of their lasagnas are a bit cheaper, this one's a special so it's a bit more expensive), it's one of the higher-priced options on the food truck circuit, but I can tell that's because of the high-quality ingredients they use.

4.5,3.0,"In addition to their killer lasagna, Basil Thyme now has an alternative southern food menu.  I love a good bbq, so even in 100 degree swamp-ass DC heat I walked over to Metro Center to give it a shot.Color me disappointed. It starts with payment. When it's time to pay, the cashier always asks if you can pay with cash. This is probably done to avoid the 2.75% Square commission, but please, just let the customer chose their preferred payment option uninterrupted. It's annoying to pressure them to do otherwise.After ordering, the food came fast. This is always appreciated and it seems like the operations in the truck kitchen work pretty smoothly. But once I lifted my Styrofoam container, it seemed to rise with surprise ease. ""Why is this so light?""There is a reason why bbq tapas aren't a thing: southern food is best with the portions are heavy. When I'm eating bbq I want it to be indulgent. And fill me up.And how did the food taste? I'll go item by item. (FYI: This was the $9 Pulled Pork Platter)- Pulled Pork: it was tasty, but that did not completely compensate for the small size. The word ""platter"" conjures up images of a heaping plate of good ol' American meat. My serving felt more like a ration.- Poppin' Jack:  A dish made of black eyed peas and rice, with a few extras. Alright flavor but nothing to tweet about.-Corn bread: What the hell happened here? Dry, burnt on the bottom, and without a side of butter, this is corn bread gone wrong. Maybe Italian cooking and bread baking are mutually exclusive skills.I wanted to love this place, but that didn't happen. It won't prevent me from coming back for the masterpiece that is their lasagna, but on southern food days? I'll eat a salad instead.",240,"Washington, DC",Basil Thyme,Dustin G.,"Washington, DC",8555887282,/biz/basil-thyme-washington

In fact I told my boyfriend that if I had to choose between hanging out with him and eating this lasagna again the lasagna would win. Literally every bite was a party in my mouth.

I'm a huge fan of salad, and this one never ceases to amaze. I scoured this yelp page to find the salad dressing name...and i cannot duplicate it. So sad...(hint hint brian...if you guys ACTUALLY UNFORTUNATELY close...I would appreciate the recipe. Thanks. lol) and yet another reason that I am FORCED to go outside and get the food!The food is usually pretty warm, and is a good hunk that fills your tummy so much so that you might need a blanket and pillow when you get back to your desk. The salad is always delish; fresh veggies that always compliment the salad and dressing. As my 1 year old Godson says....""yummo."" The only thing that is upsetting is the price. Lasagna and Salad for $11, if you get a ""special"" lasagna (like the lobster they have sometimes) you can pay up to $15. The combo is $1 extra which is a canoli and can of soda.

It was buttery hardy sharp cheese sort of flavoring. I have never tasted anything quite like it? The portions were just enough and the quality of the food is just as good as any sit down restaurant, the only difference is you're  eating out of a styrofoam carton. The side salad of field greens had a light house made vinaigrette. And for desert (yes you get dessert) a cannoli filled with pumpkin spiced cream cheese tastiness.

The cannoli is always delicious but at that point, I'm stuffed. Definitely get your $$ worth. The only thing to note is that their lasagna has gone down in quality some since last spring when I discovered them, mostly because it's not always as piping hot as they used to serve it.

4.5,5.0,"Thank you Basil Thyme!The background: I first tried the truck a few months ago after reading all the positive reviews. I found the butternut squash lasagna to be disappointing. Not bad, but it didn't live up to my high expectations. Neither did the pumpkin cannoli. The good: After having a terrible morning I noticed the truck was near my office and decided to give the lasagna another try. I encountered ""Basil Thyme's Two"" which offers pastas and ravioli. I settled on the chicken and spinach ravioli with a garlic cream sauce. It was fantastic, which I don't say lightly. I often find cream sauce to be overwhelming and heavy. This was perfect. The salad was also great and the portions of each spot on, and generous overall. It gets better - I mentioned while waiting in line to the gentleman taking orders that I was underwhelmed upon my first try. His response: ""This one is on us."" I greatly appreciate the excellent customer service I received upon my second visit. Basil Thyme went above and beyond. So thank you Basil Thyme!

The boston cream cannoli was good.I like Italian food, but I'm not a huge fan of it. However, this was GREAT.

Its far different than anything else I've ever tried!!! Just sooooo good! The Salad dressing is very good as well. Anybody with any taste buds would enjoy and the salad itself is fresh! I love the strips of real parm they put on the pasta and salad!I've also tried the chocolate, pumpkin and pistachio Canolis and they are SOOOOOO GOOD! Not too heavy, perfect consistency and just downright delicious! I can eat these canolis non-stop!My Husband and I stalk them. If they are even within a 5 block vicinity, we are there to eat it.

4.5,5.0,"Wanted to throw a quick update Basil Thyme's way, since a lot has changed regarding their business.As other reviewers have undoubtedly mentioned, they launched Basil Thyme's Two a couple of months ago. I could tell the start was a little rocky, but now they've got an ipad system and the ordering is smooth and lines are quick.Basil Thyme 1 (Lasagna):My first review for the original Lasagna truck stands firm. I've tasted their Giuseppe, Butternut, Linda (Traditional) and Lobster. All are truly gourmet. Those commercials where they serve pizza hut pasta in a fancy restaurant, then tell people ""hey it's actually pizza hut!"" -- this truck could do that and come out with flying colors. For the rest of my comments, see the original review I made for this truck.Basil Thyme's 2 (Pasta):It's hard to resist faulting them for not having cannolis at this truck after they offer them on BT1 with a combo. But, as we are told every so often, there's just not room on this truck. Ah well... first world problems right?My go to on BT2 has been the Fettuccine Buerre Blanc with Shrimp. To no fault of the chef or owner, this creamy dish always feels like I need to run an extra 2 miles afterward -- but so worth it. If that's not your thing, they have enough sauces to please any mood. Lately they've been featuring interesting ravioli dishes, and today I tried the ravioli stuffed with beef brisket. It was ridiculously outstanding. I will warn you, if you are in the mood for a bigger meal, go with a pasta dish over a ravioli. The ravioli portions aren't as big, but definitely more savory and recommended if you want a lunch of a more ""normal"" size. I tried the meatballs once and honestly those are probably the one thing that didn't feel floored by. They were just a little dense and overly spiced for my taste. Though as a half-Italian American, perhaps this is one area where nothing can compare fairly to what Grandma makes at home.BT2 is still coming up with new pasta, sauce and specialty creations, so keep checking them out. You'll probably never get bored - I haven't!Overall:I really feel like Brian, the owner, tries to go the extra mile for his regulars. He knows my name and takes the time to have a brief chat with me each week (even if it's between customers, which is totally understandable). Could this be Cheers on wheels? Maybe not, but it adds to the experience.Payment note: This truck does accept credit cards, however it's meant as a last resort if you forgot cash. Do a small business a favor and come with greenbacks if you can.",240,"Washington, DC",Basil Thyme,Jason M.,"Ann Arbor, MI",8555887282,/biz/basil-thyme-washington

The sauce was so thick and creamy, I mopped up every last bit at the end. The pasta..oh my god the pasta. I haven't had pasta that good in years. You could definitely tell it was homemade. It had the perfect bounce and bite when you chewed it . The meatballs were good, very heavily spiced but I tend to like that. To top it all off, the salad was amazing!

I have a couple of friends who are food-truck-aholics who, when asked which food truck they would keep if there were some kind of food-truck-ocalypse that caused all but one truck to disappear, they responded without hesitation that they would save Basil Thyme. Since then I've been trying to find them - I'm usually not in the areas that have a lot of food truck activity, so I was really happy when they were on Capitol Hill yesterday right where I was dropping off my sister to work.I had the Linda (at the recommendation of the very friendly gal in the truck when I told her it was my first time) with a cannoli and a soda. The price was steep - $13 - but once I saw how delicious the lasagna was, how fresh the salad was, and how awesome the cannoli was, I figured that they're using really good, fresh ingredients and let the price go.

4.5,5.0,"Mmmm...I wasn't sure about a lasagna with pork, spinach, and vodka sauce, but it was yummy.  The pork was pulled (not ground) and still had some fat on it, which was delicious. The side salad was also quite good- not too much dressing, red peppers, and fresh shaved Parmesan. I also got the cannoli (Boston cream was today's flavor), and it was one of the best I've ever had- I hate really sweet filling, where you can't even taste the subtlety of the mascarpone- this was perfect, and the chocolate was a welcomed touch. The City of DC needs to get its act together and stop making it hard for food trucks to do business- I just read the article in the city paper that said this truck is closing due to the hassles among other things.  Another note- Basil Thyme could probably do more business at metro center- I know the parking is a pain, but plenty of lesser quality trucks who charge just as much seem to be there consistently (DC taco).  I would come more often, because its right next to my office.

Well, he doesn't owe me a free meal, because it lived up to everything that he said about it.Delicious handmade, fresh pasta....in under 90 seconds. Which was another plus, since it's 30 degrees outside. Can't say that about many other trucks where a typical wait is 5+ minutes.I got the Shrimp Fettuccine w/ the buerre blanc sauce, and oh my goodness, it was incredible. Even the large side salad that came with it was amazing.And it was reasonable....$13 for a great lunch meal....worth it!",240,"Washington, DC",Basil Thyme,Annie L.,"Washington, DC",8555887282,/biz/basil-thyme-washington

On my first trip, I tried the Lisetta, which was has roasted pork and vodka sauce. It's meaty and carby and cheesy, everything I want in comfort food. I had the Guiseppe on my most recent trip, which has truffles, portabella, and gorgonzola. This one was also amazing, perhaps a bit more complex than the Lisetta, and the truffle and gorgonzola flavors balanced each other really nicely.It's also worth mentioning that the salad that comes with every pasta is also really good; clearly thought out, rather than just an afterthought, as side salads often are. This one is a really fresh spring mix, topped with roasted red peppers, kalamata olives, tomatoes, and shaved parmesan. It's easily one of the better side salads I've had, especially from a food truck.As plenty of others have said, it's also a bargain. All of the pastas are $9, except the Guiseppe, which is $11. For only $1 more, you get a drink and a cannoli.

He was particularly helpful yesterday with making sure I got the promotional discount from enrolling in LevelUp.I shied away from the Lobster the first time I visited, but it's legitimately worth the $17 price and better than most fancy entrees at sit-down restaurants. BasilThyme's confidence is this item is more than justified. The other menu item I've had, the Linda ($11), is an excellent ""standard"" beef lasagna. You can taste the fresh ingredients in both the lasagnas and the salads. The portions are generous. Also, the canolis are fantastic.

The Chicken and Florentine Lasagna....""SRT8 UP"" is my saying for DUH LISH...and CIOUS....it is very very good and cheesy and the chicken is nice and tender and the spinach gives it a nice touch.

As someone who frequently craves fresh pasta and makes it at home, the idea of being able to get it at work was exciting. I dashed to the corner and was delighted to find there were only two people in front of me in line. I ordered the kalamata olive fettucini with vodka sauce, and was happy to hear that I got a little salad, too!I waited maybe five minutes for my food. Maybe. After scampering back to my desk I inspected it and loved the little touches: basil on top of the pasta, with good-quality cheese topping the sauce and the salad. The salad had a mix of different greens, fresh-looking veggies and a really nice, light sauce. The crouton/crostini was delicious.

Not only do they have delicious lasagnas, but they include a really good salad (and I'm not even a salad kind of girl) and a cannoli sometimes as well (those I'm not going to rave about because they were usually somewhat melted, but hey, you don't complain when someone hands you free dessert).

4.5,5.0,"I'm not usually a fan of Italian, especially because when I think of lasagna, I think of a huge hunk of pasta buried under a big bland gooey mess of tomato sauce and mozzarella. Basil Thyme's lasagna is not that lasagna.You basically get a square piece (around 4"" x 5"") of some really quality homemade pasta, with equally great sauces, and meat/veggies. I've tried the Guiseppe (truffles), Lisetta (pork and vodka sauce), and the Catena (chicken, spinach, bechamel sauce). All were great, but the Catena was way better than I expected. I think it was the delicious delicious sauce.I also like how their salad is not a sad, dead pile of iceberg lettuce. Instead, you get mixed greens, cucumbers, shredded carrots, tomatoes, roasted red peppers, pecorino cheese, and their own vinaigrette dressing. Sometimes the toppings change but on any given day there are at least 3 of those on the salad. Yay!Their cannolis are also delicious. The shells manage to stay crunchy with some unique flavored creams (blueberry, chocolate, caramel, to name a few). More importantly, they are not grossly sweet like cupcakes. It's awesome.The only downside is that their prices have gone up. Last time I went I think I paid $9, without combo. Another reviewer said they paid $10, and today I paid $11 without combo when I expected to pay less than $10. It's quality, yes, but if the prices get any higher I probably won't be able to eat here as much.

4.5,5.0,"While it may not be my favorite food truck, Basil Thyme is probably the best of those I frequent regularly. The ingredients they use to make their lasagnas are top notch -- I've never had a bad slice here. For just $10, you can get a slice of lasagna, a beverage, and a cannoli. They have four types of lasagna, plus a manicotti, and the flavor of cannoli varies each day. The last time I was here, it was mocha.I've never had the manicotti, but I've had all three of their non-seasonal lasagnas. The 'Linda' is a traditional lasagna, like your mother used to make, and the variety that I almost always get, at least ever since they stopped making the Pasquale. The Lisetta is made with slow-roasted pork in a vodka sauce, while the Catena is a shallot and white wine sauteed lasagna with plenty of spinach. I don't particularly like cooked spinach, so the Catena isn't really my thing, but my wife loves it, so I trust it's just a matter of taste. The Giuseppe is their seasonal lasagna. Currently, it's a truffle and portabella lasagna that's supposed to be excellent.What really impresses me, though, is their salad. Each lasagna comes with a salad, and it's not just some iceberg lettuce arranged in the form of a salad like some people's. (I'm looking at you, Yellow Vendor.) It's a really good rich spring mix, with kalamata olives, roasted red peppers, and tomatoes, and topped with shaved parmesan cheese. They didn't need to make this impressive of a salad. Just the lasagna would have been enough. But this is a great addition to their meal.",240,"Washington, DC",Basil Thyme,Chris B.,"Washington, DC",8555887282,/biz/basil-thyme-washington
4.5,5.0,"DC is all about the food truck scene. And with that food truck scene you sometimes go for price over quality/taste. Here is a food truck that literally has it all! I stumbled upon the Basil Thyme food truck in Foggy Bottom when Citi was sponsoring a ""Lunch on Us"" event for CitiBank customers. The owner of the truck was there literally handing out free lunches to those with vouchers - he was great! So informative, gave us a run down of what was available, how it was made, and their overall goal to have quality lasagna available to their customers in under forty-five seconds. Have you ever stood in line at food truck for ages, because I sure have, so this operational goal had me convinced. Then I got back to my office to try the actual food - I got the Giuseppe. It had portobello mushrooms (big chunks of them!), gorgonzola and truffles. It was DELICIOUS. Granted, I'm a mushroom fan but this thing really hit the spot!  Their other items sounded good too - one was a traditional meat lasagna and the other was chicken white lasagna. The lasagna slice ( a good portion) also came with a side salad which made it feel less heavy and much more balanced than other things you can get off of food trucks. This is definitely a food truck to get to if its in your area... and if its not, you should go to wherever it is because its definitely worth it!",240,"Washington, DC",Basil Thyme,Kassie C.,Hong Kong,8555887282,/biz/basil-thyme-washington

4.5,5.0,"Definitely up to five stars now and most deserving of it.It took me awhile to update this review because I felt compelled to try almost every one of their offerings before giving them five stars. No, not because this isn't one of the best (if not *the best*) food truck in DC right now--- it really and truly is. And no, not because I think I am in any better position to judge than anyone else. It was simply that I liked them so much the first few times that I kept ordering the same things again and again (the Pasquale and the Lisetta) and I was afraid that I wouldn't love anything as much as I loved those two and it felt like treason to write anything but an upgrade for this truck because they were so very impressive initially.So I played it safe and stayed in love with the two I knew...the two who never failed me but were always consistently delicious while never losing their appeal.But then, one chilly October day (and a few thereafter), I became emboldened and decided to venture out a bit, throw concerns to the wind, live wild, and try something new (heavens!).So I tried the Catena, the Linda, and the vegetarian one which I think is called the Giuseppe but I am not certain (sorry, not great with names!).And, damn it, they were all good! Very, very good.My first (Pasquale) is still my favorite and this is odd....but a testament to something as I do not tend to like a lot of meats in my lasagne (hold your snickering, please) but this one manages to make it work like magic.Other things that are consistent about this truck and will remind you of a restaurant in Italy or (in my case), Mama's homecooking are:The extra touches like freshly grated parm, the realization that they are using real white wine in their sauces, the fact that they get 'al dente' right even in baked goods like manicotti and lasagne, that the vinaigrette on the salad is obviously homemade, the salad is NOT iceberg and is garnished carefully, and the fact that they are using really solid and fresh ingredients and you can taste it in every bite.  I enjoy their cannollis but I am a bit of a traditionalist here and like them relatively plain and ungarnished but, for anyone with a sweet tooth, what they have on offer is worth every bite.I also appreciate that the owner is friendly and patient and is confident enough to sell his products proudly AND promote his chef, who is obviously very talented.This is a GREAT food truck. Definitely a five star one. Try it, try all of it. You'll be in love too, I promise.",240,"Washington, DC",Basil Thyme,Patricia T.,"Washington, DC",8555887282,/biz/basil-thyme-washington

4.0,4.0,"City Tap House is a solid beer bar with a fantastic selection of tap beers, decent food, and so so service.  They change the beer up really frequently, so there's always something new to sample.  I love that you can do a $15 four beer flight with any combination of what they have on tap. I like trying new things, but I am a lightweight and really don't want more than a beer's worth of beer, so I can only branch out through flights.  (In addition to the four beer flights, you can do a flight sized serving of any beer, so if you want two or five instead of four, that's cool.)  And they get a wide variety of really interesting things from around the world.The food is good, but skewed towards heavy, unhealthy bar fare.  The mussels are excellent, as are the corn and crab hush puppies, the korean tacos, and the crab mac and cheese. Soft pretzels are decent.  Burrata is no bueno. Their salads straight up suck and there are no real vegetarian options.  They also don't offer sufficient sides -- there are a number of veggies that come with their mains (like brussels sprouts!) that they should make available a la carte and don't.  (If you ask, you *sometimes* can get the sides from an entree as sides.  Sometimes.)The service is the major flaw here.  I've had outstanding waiters and bartenders who really, really know beer, and can give reasonable advice about what to order.  I've had efficient, prompt, friendly service.  But I've also had rude, incompetent, scatterbrained servers.  They're not good at being slammed, but they often are, so you'd think they'd sort out staffing so that they have sufficient folks to deal with it.Because service is so hit or miss, if you've got someplace to be after your meal, I wouldn't ever come here.  You might get served promptly, or you might wait 15 minutes for a beer list and then another 15-20 for your damn beers.Also, unsurprisingly for a place like this, it's very loud when busy.  And they are sometimes a sports bar instead of a gastropub, complete with blaring televisions.  Cool if you want to watch the game.  Lame if you actually just wanted beer/food/chatting with friends.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Mary Beth H.,"Washington, DC",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,4.0,"Some establishments survive on their location alone. They have a prime spot but mediocre food and dismal service. We all know places like that. City Tap House is not one of these places! Located conveniently near Gallery Place-Chinatown and MetroCenter stations, as well as just a few blocks from the Verizon Center, City Tap House is the perfect place to pop in before an event, movie (Regal Cinemas is right around the corner), or to wait out rush hour during their Happy Hour, which is 5-7pm Monday through Friday, and includes select $5 draughts. First and foremost, City Tap House is serious about beer.  I was impressed by the draught list, which is broken down into flavor profiles. All the usual suspects of craft brewing were accounted for- Pale Ales, porters and stouts, wheats, Belgians, ciders, and malty brews. There were at least 25-30 draught options and even more in cans and bottles. They offer two different size options as well as a flight option of four for $15 just in case you can't commit to a full pint. I was less impressed with the $5 HH options but was fine settling on a New Belgium Ranger IPA and my dining partner went with a Jack's Cider, which was also on the $5 list. Although it was very crowded, being 6:00pm on a Friday, we managed to snag two seats at the communal table in the bar area. Keep in mind, too, HH is only in the bar area. I'm not a huge fan of communal tables, but for HH, I can deal. Our server was, obviously, very busy (he had the communal table as well as a few booths in the bar area, all of which were filled) but he was quick and attentive throughout our visit. Before we even ordered drinks, he immediately brought over two waters and came back quickly to get our drink order since we said we were in a rush to catch a movie. To get a second draught, required a little flagging down, but once it was ordered, it appeared quickly. He also got us our check in a timely manner, which we appreciated. I scoped out the reviews on Yelp beforehand, and already knew what I wanted to order when we got there. My boyfriend and I shared the honey goat cheese flatbread and the crab mac and cheese, and these picks were a total slam dunk for us! First, considering portion size, ordering two appetizers was more than enough food for us to share. If we weren't going to be out for a few hours after our meal, I would have taken some of the flatbread to go rather than stuff my face. At the same time, though, the flavors were amazing and compelled me to just keep on eating, so maybe (ie: definitely) I would have just finished it all anyways! The flatbread had a really interesting pistachio pesto that melded with the creamy goat cheese and the sweetness of the honey creating a most devine flavor combination. I really enjoyed the crunchiness added by the pistachio as well. The crust was light and airy and had a hint of honey as well; it was absolutely delicious! The crab mac and cheese was a creamy pot of heavenly cheesy goodness. The top of the dish included a nice crisp breadcrumb topping and the crab meat was plentifully dispersed evenly throughout the dish. I love a good mac and cheese (even more with lobster or crab in it), and this did not disappoint! I'm looking forward to coming back to try some of the other items that have received good reviews, particularly the Korean short rib tacos, and see what new brews are on tap since they change frequently.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Laura H.,"Arlington, VA",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,3.0,"The reason that I'm giving it 3 stars is because I didn't really like one of the dishes we ordered and the it was pretty pricey. On Thursdays the special is a fried pork shank that costs $21. The meat is cooked well and it's tender but I thought the flavor was really bland. There's not much sauce except for a little spoonfuls of an applesauce like thing, and then diced cooked carrots. The lack of flavor in the pork made me want to dip it in some BBQ sauce or something. We also got the Three Little Pigs flatbread, crab mac and cheese, and fries fried in duck fat with truffle sauce, as well as several beers. All of those were really good, although I don't know really want to spend over $12 for mac and cheese again, even if it has crab in it. I just wish the pork had more flavor to it and I would've liked this place much better.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,David K.,"Washington, DC",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,4.0,"I love City Tap House. Sure, it's a bit of a meat market as it's positively bursting with young-ish singles after work, but they have an awesome beer list (natch), a great bourbon list (sweet), and outstanding burgers (yum). They also have rather lovely outdoor seating which was perfect for myself, my husband and our 6-month-old daughter as we weren't super interested in the bar scene inside. The service was excellent once things got underway; there was a strange delay in  seating us as the staff was going through its' change over, which left us waiting on the sidewalk with our baby for no less than 20 minutes. This is the single reason for my removal of 1 star -- it was really irritating and we almost left. I just feel that your customers and their comfort should be the priority over some silly formality. Anyway... The service we did end up having was great. Our server was welcoming, cheery, professional and well versed in the menu. They were also sweet to accommodate our baby, which is much appreciated (she's super-well behaved so we think nothing of bringing her along, but you'd be SHOCKED at the amount of death-stares we get for doing so).The menu is impressive -- the burgers I mentioned, delightful burrata, a mezze platter, interesting seafood dishes -- basically, something for everyone and all the drinks to go along with it. I tried a few of their pilsner options and was really delighted with each one. They were served at precisely the right temperature and we crisp, refreshing and fresh. All in all, this was a wonderful experience and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place or go back again. They just need to smooth things over with their weird staff protocols and they'll be a 5-star joint.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Hilary H.,"Providence, RI",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,4.0,"Drinks - 5 starsFood - 3 stars= 4 stars for City Tap HouseFirst, I love the location of City Tap House -- it's also a block away from City Center which is a great place to wait for your friends to meet you, as they will inevitably be 15-30 minutes late due to red line delays.City Tap House has one of the largest selections of beer I've ever seen, and the fact that they offer two sizes (normal & tiny) is awesome for me (a one-shot wonder) because it means I can order a $3 vessel of Jack cider and be sufficiently buzzed.However, the food did not impress. The duck fat fries were disappointing - the fries were lukewarm & you could not taste the duck fat at all (very sad since I absolutely love bread slathered with duck fat and was hoping to taste something reminiscent of it.) My friend had the margherita pizza and it was very average. Perhaps we ordered the wrong things? I did sneak a peek at the neighboring table's selections & there was a dish with humongous scallops that looked pretty good.But for now, I think I'll stick to coming back to City Tap House for drinks & happy hour only!",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Christine Y.,"Washington, DC",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,4.0,"We had a very bad experience in the past and were approached via Yelp by the General Manager (Pearson), about our experience. He offered a chance for the establishment to make it up to us, and I agreed to come out. On Thursday night we came out to City Tap House and was greeted right away and after a short wait we were ushered to our table. We were then greeted by Pearson who apologized again for the previous bad experience and introduced us to our Fantastic Server ""Stephanie!"" The experience this time was very positive! The manager did hook us up with a very samples of all the different appetizers, which were all pretty good. Did not personally care for the Korean Tacos or the Tar Tar. All the entrees were enjoyed, and the beverages were nice and cold. Was a little upset though they didn't have my favorite beer (that I had last time I was there), but a nit pick from an other wise amazing dinner.

4.0,4.0,"Late Sunday brunch on the patio- yes please! As an FYI, the kitchen switches from a Brunch menu to their Lunch menu at 3, but is still open - so it isn't like you will starve after, haha!Honestly, I don't really have any gripes. Service was just fine (friendly enough, but not too nosey), the beer was great (according to my friends who are beer lovers) and the food was any where betwen brilliant ( the spoon cornbread) to just meh (arugula salad with quinoa).I got the salad, and it was really just meh. I think my problem was the dressing - there was too much of it, and I want to say the oil from the dressing was definitely stale - it had that stale oilive oily taste to it.One of my frenz had the chicken and waffles - I think he cried a little when he ate it.. he loved it that much :) I also had the side of the spoon cornbread and OMG was it yummy or what! Every bite was delicate, creamy, perfect texture and oh so yummy! We also had the quiche - very very yummy! It was super goat cheesy, perfect texture and a pretty big slice. The side of skillet potatoes was pretty delish - little lacking in salt if anything.All in all, it was a great brunch - for many different reasons :) Will I be back - definitely yes!

They said the delay was due to the lunch rush. That's all understandable, but a couple next to us (who arrived later than us) received their food before us.

4.0,4.0,"I've been here twice before this review. The first time we came in to try a bunch of appetizers. We tried the duck fat fries  (so delicious ) they came with a aioli dip. We also order the tuna tartar as well. Which was served on a bed cucumbers and served with a side of fresh wonton like chips. It was so delicious and cold. We then ordered the short rib tacos. The toppings were so fresh and the cilantro stood put but didn't overpower the taco. Its a little messy so I would suggest bring your mouth to the taco over you plate, it certainly drips all over the place one you take the first bit. Still worth it I'm my opinion. The last thing we tried was the tarfufo pizza. Mushrooms, pork, and a fried egg in the middle that still had a running yolk. Umm might have been the best pizza ever. Its enough to share with someone as well. My second time the next day. I we tried the steak salad and 10 spice wings. The wings weren't my style they had a bit of sweet taste them them. They were dry wings served with blue cheese I'm sure they could come up with a other orginal sauce for those wings. The steak salad was actually good but I would have preferred a different type of luttuce to fancy it up a bit. The King rosè was delicious as well. They have a huge list of beers that change everyday and the scene it pretty loud in the front. A lot worker bees after work they sort of make you feel like they have taken over the whole place. Its expected but once you pass that crowd there is a larger area for dining in and a space towards the back if you want to hear your conversations. Please know that its a tap house noise is expected so if you're looking for a place that you need to have a quiet dinner it's not the place for you.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Michelle P.,"Washington, DC",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington

4.0,3.0,"I had specifically bookmarked City Tap House as a potential beer bar/lunch spot before coming to DC and as I was in the area during my last day I decided to take advantage and check it what they had to offer.It was pretty hot outside so instead of taking one of the several outdoor seating options available, I headed inside and was lucky to score a spot at the bar.  I was surprised since it was 2pm on a Tuesday that both the bar and restaurant were still hopping, but DC is a bustling city so I should not have been surprised.Unfortunately what I was surprised with was the lack of wait staff.  From the bar to the restaurant they seemed to be severely understaffed - with the manager even bussing tables and expediting food.  I could not even grab the attention of the bartender to get a beer menu - but luckily a customer next to me was able to let me borrow theirs.  I will say that their tap list is very impressive - with the brews not only arranged by style but also giving a little description besides each one.  It makes it hard for even the novice beer drinker to make a wrong decision.  I finally was able to order a Bell's Oberon and settled in to look over the menu.  After several minutes I decided to order the Cubano with a side of duck fat fries (highly rated on Yelp) but unfortunately I had to again flag down our waitress to place my order.Luckily I also placed an order of their fried pickles as a starter and I am glad I did!  Thinly sliced, well seasoned kosher pickle chips served golden brown with a side of red pepper aioli - they hit the spot with my beer and quelled my growing hunger.  I also loved that they were served in a small deep fry basket - a nice touch. I was glad I had that appetizer because it took 45 minutes from the time my order was placed to get my meal - 45!  It probably would have taken longer but I (again) flagged down our waitress to see what the hold up was.  When my food was finally brought out - it did not stand a chance.  The cubano was good enough - pork flavor was spot on but the portion of pork to bun was lop sided and not toward the pork.  The duck fat fries with truffle aioli - disappointing and I am sure they would have been better if they were brought out about 5 minutes earlier (cold) and taken out of the fryer about 2 minutes earlier (overdone).  Luckily I had a wonderful beer(s) to wash it down with.So I am breaking my rating down like this:Service - 1.5Beer - 4Food - 3So - 2.8 and I will round to 3.  Go for the beer and be prepared to wait!",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Anne C.,"Wethersfield, CT",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,5.0,"While visiting family and friends in D.C., I had the opportunity to enjoy the City Tap House for a late afternoon lunch/dinner.  First I will confess living in Chattanooga TN and not having lived in or around a big city in a long time, I have to acknowledge, parking sucks, prices are high, everything is crowded and if you want to go anywhere it takes time and patience!  That said, we were four adults, a toddler and an infant in our party and it was around 3 PM on Saturday afternoon, and we had no wait!  The waiter was friendly, professional and very accommodating.  They have a full bar and LOTS of draught craft beer, which they make on site.   Parking in DC is a challenge and we ended up parking all day for 16 dollars in a covered parking garage.  The restaurant had a nice bar, tables, high tops and booths, which we sat in.  They have TVs throughout the restaurant and the atmosphere was relaxing.  I had the 3 pigs omelet with potatoes and while pricey, it was very good.  ( I Know -- everything is in DC unless it is an small hole in the wall ethnic restaurant)  Others had Quiche Avacado,  softshell crab fries and a burger... they all raved about the quality of the food, and rightly so.   The waiter was very accommodating letting us sample the beers, which I tried 3 and they were all excellent.  The only downsize and not that big of a deal is service was very slow and we sat for a long time before we were provided beverages.  Also the appetizer came with the meals, which was disappointing.  KUDOS though because they provided a 10% military discount on the whole bill which was classy.   Taking into account I live in an income tax free, not very populated and low cost of living state, I will rate it like I lived there!.  I will give it a 4 for quality of the food and great selection of beers and add 1 for their support of Military with a 10% discount.  Also the waiter, while slow was excellent.  I recommend stopping there for a nice lunch or dinner.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Joe C.,"Hixson, TN",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington

I've only come for their great brunch but this visit was particularly amazing. It was NOT my first visit (4th actually) but  it was a first for the food for my plus 1 (she forgotten that she'd actually been there before BUT it was only for drinks; not food). I almost don't know where to begin but it was kind of packed even though me and my plus one came in literally at like 11:34am (11 minutes early to our 11:45 reservation). The 2 hostesses at the very front were pleasant and it was just uphill from there to the very end. For it to be fairly busy from the moment we got there until we left close to 1:30pm our service was absolutely top-notch. I do remember Pearson (my friend remembers it as Peterson but after my 7 mimosas to her 6 (both opted for the unlimited mimosas....AMAZING deal). we are probably both fuzzy on his name). He was very pleasant, super duper attentive and just on-point overall my whole visit checking on various tables including ours....not too intrusive, just right and it was very refreshing almost touching. Feel confident if you find G.M. (General Manager) Pearson around he'll be sure you're taken care of....at least that's the impression I got when I was there from beginning to end. On top of the all around top-notch attentive service the food was super good (a reason why this is my 4th visit). I got sweet potato fries w/ bourbon mustard and 'ten spice wings' (my only regret is not getting an order of all of this to go lol). Everything tasted divine. I am so glad I don't live closer to this place. I didn't get the 'Big Chick' this time but it is a must-have....it's definitely going to get in my belly on another visit (and there's definitely another visit coming in another month or so).  My friend had some Benedict with crab and filet mignon .... she liked it quite a bit but was a little disappointed in their not being as much crab as expected. She was definitely given a lot of food for the price though. I did manage to get one of her poached eggs which was yummy.  Last thing is the cornbread.....Pearson mentioned his grandmother being from New Orleans and I said mine was from South Carolina (as well as my mother). Now....he promised this would be in my top 3 cornbread ever. Well he was close....solid top 5 for sure. It has a kick on jalapenos sprinkled on top but you can roll them off to the side of not your thing. It had a nice honey butter and syrup that came with it....all around divine. If you find you don't like it they will remove it from the bill but my plus 1 and I looooovvveed it :).  Very repeat-worthy.  One day I might try their dinner but I love their brunch so much.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,E C.,"Washington, DC",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington

If there's two things that Portland ex pats/recent alums and current undergrads/Portland inhabitants love, it's good beer. Cue Student Alumni Association planning an event in lounge space immediately above the bar. This seating are is great, you can call down directly (and politely, damnit) to the bar tenders, and get the quickest service imaginable. The bartenders were all really great in letting you try different beers and making suggestions, with over 40 beers on tap, that's a great bonus.  All of the food we had was good, pizzas, crab cakes on a stick, vegetable platters, hummus platters--all delicious. The food certainly had a lighter, cleaner finish than what you would expect from a bar with 40 beers on tap. If you've got a gang of people who like genuinely like beer, or at least would like to try a variety of beers, this is an excellent option.

I had the honey goat cheese flatbread and was quite pleased.  There were bottomless mimosas available  for brunch for $18...not bad.There was a huge, almost 3 pages long, beer selection.  I'd  say there was something for everyone.  If you get the chance I would recommend you try this place out!",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Robin O.,"McLean, VA",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,5.0,My husband and I stopped here on a whim. We wanted to grab a quick bite to eat before our show at the Warner Theater. We were able to book on yelp reservations while on the train. Due to the wonderful orange line we were late but they were able to still accommodate our reservations.We sat down and began to scan the menu for a good drink and appetizer. We ordered two beers and duck fat fries and fried pickles. I loved the duck fat fries and would recommend for anyone to try them out. The fried pickles were a miss for me. The breading was not crispy like I am use to. They are the circles and not the spears for all you pickle lovers.My husband and I both ordered the tap house burger. It was cooked to perfection and would order again. I got the salad with mine and it was in a little cup. The dressing on it was delicious. I wish on the menu it would tell you what you get with burgers. If we would have known this prior we wouldn't have ordered the duck fat fries before hand. However our waiter took care of this for us.I also want to let you know that this place had excellent customer service. When we had a mishap with ordering the duck fat fries not knowing they would also be included in the burger meal our waiter corrected the issue for us. Our waiter was extremely attentive and made sure we were well taken care of despite how busy the restaurant was on a Saturday evening.,718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Amanda K.,"Fairfax, VA",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,4.0,"This place was at a convenient location, very close to our hotel and in a safe part of town, well lit at night. The drink options were good when it comes to craft beer, they have a huge selection BUT very expensive! The entree options were good as well with different price options from $15-$30. We made reservations because we had a large party and didn't encounter a problem. The table was ready for us and the staff was nice and helpful. All in all, I would have to say the prices were a little high for something you could get somewhere else; nothing special",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Nicole N.,"Winston-Salem, NC",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,5.0,"Ever since the Yelp event that I went to, I have been craving the Radler that they serve here. It is a regular Radler, a bit sweeter than the ones I had in Germany, but composition-wise, the same. The twist to the Radler here is that they add a shot of gin in the Radler, which increases the alcohol content, but complements each other well. I still enjoyed it this time around. The location was perfect to gather friends together to catch up on a Friday. However, one word of caution, it does get crowded around 5:30 forward. I did not try the food, but I am sure it does well to complement their beer selection. Since it was a bit crowded, you really do not need to worry that it might get loud or rowdy. Just be yourself. The Bartenders are nice and playful, which always makes the experience much better. One of the bartenders, who was not really helping me gave me a sample of a beer they were trying out. I liked this type of service because there really is no way to telling which selection suits your taste unless you try it. Overall, it was a great hangout spot with friends. It has the bar feel, but also restaurant part. Next time I want to try bringing in a larger party so we can sit at the couch area behind the bar.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Philip L.,"Washington, DC",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,4.0,"Having lived 2 blocks from City Tap House for almost a year, my husband and I found every excuse to save it to check it out ""some other time"". ""Long weekend? Let's go somewhere FARRR. They have gazillion beers on tap? Let's wait to take friends who would appreciate the selection!"" Not until we finally did have friends in town and I was held back by hospital calls (boo to not going anywhere far), we stopped by to check out their brunch menu. There were a handful of items I wanted to try! Their famous Blue crab mac and cheese wasn't offered on brunch menu but the waitress graciously offered to ask the kitchen to make it for us. Ultimately however the four of us opted for individual entrees - ricotta pancakes, blue crab craftwich with sweet potato fries, chicken and waffles, and salmon hash. After reviewing yelp pictures, I was surprised by the size of the entrees - they were at least twice the size I expected them to be. Perhaps the huge plate/bowl just made the portion appeared much smaller? Ricotta pancakes - fluffy and perfectly sweetened. Still doesn't beat NYC's Almond's lemon ricotta pancakes but these were pretty good. Bluecrab openface craftwich - juicy lumps of crab meat+ melted Havarti cheese + handful of flavorful sun dried tomato + fresh avocado slices on toasty sourdough = the perfect bite. I especially loved the honey mustard aioli pairing. Gotta pat myself on the back for the swap of their perfectly crisped and non-greasy sweet potato fries! Chicken and waffles - beautiful presentation! Savory bacon bits and sweet pepper jam to go along with crispy yet juicy fried chicken = so yummy!  However, I was underwhelmed by the soggy, tasteless waffles. Thank goodness for maple syrup to save the day!Salmon hash - generous serving of grilled, flaky salmon + two beautifully poached eggs over almost what appeared to be ""bottomless"" potato hash. This dish was much heavier than expected. They were a bit heavy handed in the amount of oil used in making the hash. And the amount of potato... would def recommend it as a ""hangover"" cure - nevertheless, a good but not memorable dish. Overall - I was impressed by the quality and the quantity of the food offered here in City Tap! Definitely exceeded my expectation of a gastropub! Service was attentive, price was fair. With just walking distance away, my husband and I look forward to returning to check out their dinner/happy hours/late night grub menu!",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Wing C.,"Manhattan, NY",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,5.0,"City tap house is conveniently located next to the Renaissance Marriott near the convention center.  They offer a laid back atmosphere with many beers on tap. The beverage offerings are impressive. The menu has a wide variety of delicious appetizers and entrees. I found the fried pickles and fries to be particularly delicious.  Our party tried pizzas and burgers. The burgers in particular were cooked perfectly and very well seasoned. The food here is excellent. The service could use a little bit of work. While our server and the manager were clearly working hard, they were way understaffed.

4.0,5.0,"My new favorite restaurant in my hood! I love this place!!! The first time I came here was during a yelp event and the restaurant staff and general manager, Pierson, won me over with the superb customer service. Since then, I've been back 4x (3x for dinner and 1x for brunch). Dinner menu is great. American cuisine with a twist. Definitely different from your standard restaurant food. The beer selection is extensive as well. The place is really big so you can either enjoy a few drinks at the bar or have a nice dinner at the dining area. I only had to wait one time for dinner but it was worth it (only 15 mins). The staff really makes this place 5 stars plus. Their brunch is really GOOD. One of the best brunch dishes I've had in DC, I ordered the hash salmon benedict and it just melted in my mouth with every delicious bite. There is a bottomless drink option for $15 (or $18...I can't remember) dollars per person during brunch and a build your own bloody mary bar. DO IT. Its definitely worth it if you want a boozy brunch.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Vy L.,"Washington, DC",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,4.0,"Came here on a Saturday for brunch. This place was packed! Like a dinner crowd. Without reservations it was more than a 30 minute wait. Thankfully after 15 minutes two seats at the bar came available. Score! This place has so many craft beers on tap. Will have to come back for happy hour. The bottomless mimosas and bloody Mary's is $18. Well worth it if you drink 2 mimosas. The smoked salmon hash was real good with poached eggs (cooked perfectly) salmon, and lots of potatoes. Very hearty meal. My friend had chicken and waffles. The seasoning on the chicken was great! No need to pour the syrup.  It was huge! More than enough for two people.  The mimosas and Bloody Mary was flowing and we were quite happy. Note: The parking garage for Renaissance hotel offers discounted parking for 3 hours of you get ticket validated after 5pm. Hearty food portions, great beer selections, good service.

4.0,3.0,Came for lunch with a colleague who highly recommended the food and atmosphere. The service was a little slow ( we were there after the lunch rush) and we had three different servers come to the table at various different points during the meal.

The beer selection is on point and I would definitely come back in the evening for a fun night. Service is the only piece of our experience that knocked this to a 3 star review but otherwise I would definitely recommend!,718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Maya H.,"Brookline, MA",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington

This place was full but we were lucky to get the tables as soon as we walked in. The waiter was super friendly and when asked he actually gave me a suggestion on beer I should try based on my fav list. I ordered Sweetwater Georgia brown and it was definitely crisp and I loved it. The service was slow  because the place was packed but defiantly an area for improvement. But the manager more than make up for it when he gave the free beer passes to few of us although I wished he should have done that for the whole table (there were only 5 of us). I am vegetarian so I ordered their Mezze plate, and it was  good. I loved both  hummus and curry dip but bread was average.

4.0,2.0,"2.5/5 stars. I almost wanted to round up to 3-stars because our waiter made Beyoncé references when describing their Chicken & Waffles, but his humor was not enough to offset the overpriced and underwhelming food.I came to City Tap House with my mom, dad, brother, and boyfriend on a Saturday afternoon, which means we ordered off their brunch menu. Our family ordered a whole bunch of stuff to share. My dad is an aggressive food orderer. We got a loooot of food. Here are my thoughts.- Ten Spice Wings - Super flavorful wings. Slightly sweet, tangy, and peppery (?) This was our table's favorite.- Soft Pretzel w/ Smoked Gouda Fondue - An expensive pretzel. Skip this.- Crab Mac & Cheese (normally not listed on their brunch menu, but our server said that the kitchen could whip this up for us) - Too much cheese, not enough pasta. It was too saucy for me.- Chicken & Waffles - I was expecting a lot more for $19. It was literally just breaded chicken on top of three soggy waffle wedges. - Lobster Roll - My #1 lobster roll pet peeve = excessive mayo. I wasn't even sure if I was eating a lobster roll anymore because all I could taste was butter and mayo.- Duck Fat Fries - OK, this was good. I couldn't stop eating them. - And of course my dad/boyfriend ordered a bunch of beers! As per usual, they gave the beer two big thumbs up. Sigh. Of all the items we got, I can honestly say that I only liked their Duck Fat Fries and the Ten Spice Wings, which is pretty unacceptable considering the fact that the bill came out to be a little over $200, Nononono.

4.0,3.0,"After the DC Auto Show my gf and her family stopped by here to enjoy a late lunch. At 2:30 they were serving their brunch menu and honestly it was just average. I have had better brunch elsewhere. Between 5 people we had the duck fat fries, their blue crab mac and cheese, 10 spiced wings, and the soft pretzel with smoked gouda for an appetizer. At that time the blue crab mac and cheese wasn't on the menu so I think the waiter was kind enough to let us get it. For entrees we ordered the 2 orders of the lobster roll and 2 orders of the chicken and waffle. As far as the food goes the best dish was probably the 10 spiced wings. They were addicting and really good but everything else was just average. Our waiter raved about the chicken and waffles and since I  never had chicken and waffles I thought I would try them out here. The chicken was soggy and the waffle didn't seem fresh. It seemed like they were frozen, if they are going to charge $19 for this dish it better be fresh waffles. The lobster roll was drenched in mayo which I was not a fan off. The pretzel when dipped in the gouda cheese was very salty, I would recommend scraping off some of the salt if you want to eat the pretzel dish. Their duck fat fries were unique and everyone else at the table enjoyed it. I can't say I was a huge fan of it, too greasy for my taste.I can only say one thing, their selection of beer is vast and the beers were pretty good. As the name of the restaurant implies, I would recommend coming here to drink but food wise it was more of a miss. The customer service here was decent, the manager introduced himself and checked up on my table. One of the beers came out wrong and they quickly fixed this issue.

I had the goat cheese flatbread. That plain description. Yea, leaves much to be desired. It was just the ""o"" in ok. The environment was great. Food came out quick but I truly believe if our server had the freedom to truly serve and not be tied in a meeting, our experience would have been better.

4.0,2.0,"I think I need to re-evaluate this whole ""eating out"" thing.  I mean, it's nice to hit the town and try a new spot.  There's a certain thrill involved.  That said, when that thrill turns to a lack of fulfillment, paying that bill can feel like a jail sentence...a penalty for an unfortunate error in judgement.City Tap House is a relatively new restaurant found on the outskirts of Chinatown.  The space is moderately sized and the seating setup is on the cozy side.  Intimate is one way to describe the decor, although the color scheme reminds me of a country western theme. The service is pretty good.  The server was very attentive and knew the menu pretty well.  She also moved quickly towards providing beverage refills and removing finished plates.I tried the Korean Short Ribs, Ten Spice Wings, Steak Frites, Lobster Roll and Blueberry Buckle.The Korean Short Rib Tacos came with pickled cabbage slaw, cilantro  and chili sauce.  Tasty little devils.  The short rib was moist and fairly tender.  The operative word in describing these tacos is little.  Three little tacos....for $13.  For the math majors, that's $4.33 per taco.  Crazy!  The Ten Spice Wings  are a popular dish at the restaurant.  They are dry rubbed and served with house blue cheese.  Ahhhhhh, just ok.  I'll admit that I tend to be more a fan of wet wings.  That said, I do like some dry wings such as the ones at Outback Steakhouse.  At City House, the first problem is they're fried way too hard.  That makes the skin pretty dry and also renders the rub kinda useless.  The rub is actually a little bland considering the moniker of ""ten spice"".  I did pick up a little sweetness at the end of each bite.  The meat is tender, which was nice.  The blue cheese sauce is very bland.  Overall, a flat dish.The Steak Frites consists of grilled skirt steak, duck fat fries, chimichurri, and salad.  Best thing about the dish was the fries.  The concept of them being fried in duck fat really didn't translate to flavor.  They were well seasoned though, had a nice balance of being tender/crispy and paired well with a garlic aioli sauce.  The steak was average at best.  While it was juicy, chewy is another word I'd use.  Bland is also another descriptor I'd throw out there.  The chimichurri  sauce is also maddeningly bland.  See a theme here?The Lobster Roll is composed of poached lobster, celery, green onion, mayonnaise, on a buttered roll.  I'll start with my side dish, which I subbed and turned into a side salad.  I have a problem with the movement towards so much bitter lettuce that seems to be happening at several places.  Who are they catering too...rabbits?  Bitter on bitter is not appealing.  Gotta have something to cut the bitterness a little and provide some balance.  Now, with the Lobster Roll....umm.....ok.  It was alright.  Want me to put it another way?  It was.....aiiiiight.  That's actually a more accurate description because I'm not sure it deserves the ""l"" or the effort it takes to properly pronounce the word.  A decent amount of lobster existed, but something was amiss.  I'm gonna say freshness was an issue because the lobster smelled a little off.  That may explain the tummy troubles I experienced later.  Scent aside, the most off-putting part of this dish was the price.  $26!!The Blueberry Buckle is the restaurant's spin on blueberry pie.  It was actually a decent dessert.  A little heavy and with a lot of crust/crumble, which made things a little dry.  I think it could have used a little more ice cream than the teaspoon I got.  Not bad though.   This is the best way I can summarize my experience.  Ever get the bill and wonder how the f**k did it get to that point?  My bill was roughly about $100. WHAT?  Evidently, the cost of being underwhelmed and unfulfilled has gone up.  Memo received!  It can't be any surprise that this place is OVERRATED!  Can someone say price inflation?",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Mo A.,"Washington, DC",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington

4.0,5.0,"Boyfriend and I were looking for a good place to eat. His requirements: beer and sports to watch. My requirements: good food without it being too loud of a place.City Tap House: check on all requirements.After a day of exploring and shopping, we wanted to eat. Luckily, we had made some reservations and got seated immediately right when we walked in. We got placed in a room that had some TVs that helped us keep up with sports news.Our waiter came by and told us the specials, but we were more excited about the beer selection and food to eat. Boyfriend likes the dark beers so he was especially happy with the selection of stouts to choose from. I chose my girly fruity beer that always makes me happy. Win win.Food selections was exciting for the inner fat kid in me. I love popcorn and they have a popcorn that also has bacon, peanuts, chives. That ended up gone by the time we left. Also, duck fat fries... and that was gone too. I love that it came with truffle aioli or mayo. I'm a weirdo that eats fries with mayo so the truffle addition makes it all the more better. Boyfriend also ordered some pizza. It was a good size to share between the two of us and definitely worth the order. To end the night, we got dessert. We ordered some gelato and found we could order 3 different flavors. Ended up picking chocolate, a berry flavor, and another one I can't quite remember.

4.0,3.0,"City Tap House is the type of place that will give you deja vu. As in ""I would have sworn I went here with coworkers after that terrible meeting where Bill told us to redo all our TPS reports...."", no wait that was the other upscale craft beer joint with locally sourced chef driven bar snacks and a hyped burger (otherwise known as a gastropub)! It has a name that sounds mildly generic, and a concept that has been well played out nationally for the past half-decade. The décor and location doesn't help matters: it's a large space with lots of light wood finishes in an expensive drag of the district just like many other pricey district drags scuttling with lawyers and politicos. But lack of originality doesn't precisely need to be a bad thing, sometimes you just want a burger and a beer and to sit around burping on a barstool for a little while. And to that end, City Tap House fits the bill admirably. Be warned, this place hasn't exactly flown under the radar. It's extremely popular with the business lunch crowd, the game night watch party crowd, the casual dinner with buddies crowd, the why-the-heck-are-you-guys-all-out-on-a-Tuesday?! crowd. Sometimes you can get thrown an elbow even trying to squeeze into a bar seat for one. So even though it's a huge space, I would recommend reservations just to be on the safe side.    It's a little pricy, but that should be expected for the neighborhood, and it is much cheaper than other places you can grab lunch nearby (I'm lookin' at you, Del Campo). The food is largely delicious, with some bright patches of creativity scattered throughout the menu. The chef here seems like he runs a tight ship; food comes out at a good pace, even when the restaurant is slammed. I've sampled:-Duck fat fries with Truffle Aioli: NO. STOP IT. PUT THE DUCK FAT DOWN AND BACK AWAY FROM THE TRUFFLES. BAD CHEF, GO SIT IN THE CORNER AND THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO YOUR MENU! This is how I feel every time I read ""truffle"" or ""duck fat"" on a menu nowadays. I get it, it sounds fancy, it sounds indulgent, it sounds like a good way to trick people into spending huge amounts for fried spuds. But it's just a damn French fry, people! Don't guild the lily lest you want some eye rolling from me. So saying, these were good fries in the only ways that matter: not greasy, not limp, thick enough to stand up to serious dipping and have potato tasting soft innards, and with some crunch skin still on some fries.  -Sweet corn and crab hushpuppies with honey-thyme butter and citrus remoulade ($14). Delicious. I have not a single thing I would change about this. The texture on the puppies was perfect, with a solid dark brown outside crunch and cornmeal inside. The crab also shines through in the puppy, which is really quite hard to pull off in anything battered and fried, given crab is such a delicate flavor. The sauce (or remoulade for you fancy foodies) paired perfectly, and cut through the fat.-Lamb neck gravy with herbed ricotta and grilled bread ($10)-Very rich, very meaty, very very tasty. This is the type of dish you'd more expect to get from your grandmother than a restaurant. It has flavors that meld so well because they're slowly and lovingly cooked down for hours and seasoned just right. Not a single bite of this dish can be called light though, so I'd categorize this under ""salad eater's kryptonite"". -The tap burger ($14)- Solid, classic, and not bank-breaking. Thick patty cooked to ordered temperature. Not the best in the city by any stretch (that honor goes to Bourbon Steak), but not the worst either. Desserts are all delicious. If you have room, indulge! TL;DR: For what this place is trying to do (gastropub chic), it nails it. I just wish the place got a little bit more of its own unique flair or point of view, otherwise I'll keep confusing it with a dozen other places (#nonproblemsoftheyelplife).",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Wilma D.,"Washington, DC",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,4.0,"Came here for their Memorial Day oyster shuckfest with a party of 3 with no reservations. The wait they quoted us was 45 minutes. We went and ordered two rounds of drinks at the bar before we got sat, which was just under 40 minutes. The restaurant had many tables open or uncleaned ones because it seemed as though they were understaffed, which was odd since they were having their annual oyster shuckfest. We didn't mind however since it was Memorial Day and I'm sure they had some call outs. We wanted to order 3 dozen oysters since it was only $12/dozen. The server said oysters would take at least 30 minutes before hitting the table but we ordered them anyway. We also got the crab mac n'cheese which was creamy, delicious and rich in crab flavor. The honey goat cheese flatbread was also so good! They had this pesto sauce on it that was just full of flavor and complimented the sweetness of the honey and creaminess of the goat cheese in the most unusual but pleasant way. I would've liked it even more if it was a tad bit crispy. Tried to order the oyster po'boy but was informed that it was sold out. So disappointed. The oysters came out about 30 minutes later and we devoured them. Delicious, briney and meaty. Service was slow and they were definitely under-prepared for today but the food makes up for it. Everything I put in my mouth, I enjoyed so much. I only found this place through events going on on YELP and I'm glad I did.

4.0,4.0,"I came here for a late night dinner a few weeks ago. It was a warm night so dinning al Fresco was an ideal choice. I had the duck fat fries with the Aioli sauce and they were so delicious. Just the right amount of crisp and the herbs sprinkled on the fries and a perfect flavor combination.  I also had the Ten Spice wings, they are ok. I can't really place the flavors but it is a pretty good mix of sweet, salty and savory.  I didn't not see a cocktail menu but it is a full bar so there was no issues with making my fav drink, The Moscow Mule. Excellent job by the bartenders. The restaurant is pretty busy during the late night hours but the hostess and managers are very friendly. We were seated immediately and our server was at our table introducing herself within 5 minutes. Yay!

4.0,5.0,"Everything here is amazing. My bf and I came here for my birthday brunch this past Sunday. Part of the reason why we came to DC was to brunch here! Last year we stumbled upon this gem and didn't want to leave. The food is delicious and savory comfort food. I had the salmon hash (last year) and the chicken and waffles (this year); everything was cooked to perfection. Also, the Bloody Mary bar is insane. Love that we were able to create our own. I wish we had something similar in NYC. The service is also very good. Our server, Chris, was very attentive, asking us how our meal was. Some places forget you're there once you sit down and start eating. Not the case with him. Additionally, our drinks were always refilled quickly (brunch ends at 3pm). He made sure we each had a full drink at the table, even though the restaurant was packed during brunch. Pearson, the manager, also came by to make sure my bf and I were having a great time. As others mentioned in previous reviews, the staff here really does care about their customers. The service is genuinely friendly and warm, without being too overbearing or annoying.

4.0,5.0,"I really really love City Tap House...as in if I lived in DC Id be a regular kinda love.Great layout with tons of televisions. Separate spaces for the bar, the dining, and a backroom which is a tad bit more quiet.They have an amazing selection of beers and ales on tap...with the alcohol %....yeah the 13% had me intrigued but 13 bucks a pint was a tad steep.Food is stellar here as well. The apps are just amazing. Wonderful 10 spice wings, Crab mac and cheese was phenomenal ( you could actually taste and savor the blue crab in it),  corn and crab hushpuppies again you could actually taste the maryland blue crab, fried pickles and the spicy dipping sauce were awesome, lobster roll was small but very tasty ( pricey at 26 bucks) and the duck fat fries are great...I could seriously extoll all of their food as it was all good.Service was simply stellar with our server refilling glasses asap. The general manager came by to make sure everything was ok as well.Close to the verizon center for sports or concerts.This place is simply fantastic.Highly recommend.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,David G.,"San Francisco, CA",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,5.0,"I thought this place would be just another place with semi-decent food and semi-decent beer.  The food was actually excellent, though probably a little richer and fattier than you'd want to admit.  We had the arugula and quinoa salad, where the dressing hid the bitterness of the arugula entirely, and the burger with duck fat fries.  Their beer list includes a selection of local, national, and international beers.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Ling W.,"Washington, DC",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,4.0,"Came here with a couple friends, one who had never been to DC before. Nice interior, sophisticated menu, plenty of beers and whiskeys, although I was going for a cocktail, of which they also had a pretty selection. I ordered the sparkling sangria and crab mac & cheese. Sangria was delish and refreshing but was quite the small drink in a little champagne flute and cost $12. I followed that by the one and only cider on their menu, Jack's which is a good one! The crab mac I intended to share. I didn't really share very well, it was too good. It definitely wasn't lump crab meat, very finely shredded so not sure how much was really in there but compared to prices of other crab macs I've had, this one was inexpensive so maybe that's why. Friends had some tasty beers and a bangin' soft pretzel! Get that! Plus it might be the cheapest thing on the menu. If you hadn't caught on, this place isn't inexpensive. I'm still getting used to DC prices. Some other friends met up with us after a while, all very happy with our venue choice. I had a sip of the Steigl Grapefruit Radler. Man that was awesome! It'd not beer which is why I like it but it tasted like what I would call a grapefruit cider. Kind of like Fresca but better. And alcoholic lolI'm looking forward to coming back some day, a friend in Adam's Morgan, Danielle P, has been here at least once a week for the past month so that speaks to how consistently good everything is. Oh, and service was a little jumbled between the two bartenders trading off taking our orders and everyone else's and forgetting to put in a food order.

4.0,5.0,"Another successful birthday activity, thanks to the folks at City Tap House. I cannot help but note the amazing people that made my day awesome.1) Ginger -- She was able to help me increase my reservation from 8 to 12 when a few extra people decided they could make it. She was so nice and helpful via email. Working with her was so easy!2) The GM came by my table to greet everyone, thank us for coming, and ensured I got a free birthday dessert. That was unnecessary but so incredibly nice! Loved meeting him and seeing how thankful he was that we all visited.Service was great and fast. Without asking, our server split the bill between 10 people and did not charge gratuity. Amazing. Saturday brunch, when we visited, was not busy at all. At 12:30pm there were plenty of tables for large and small parties.Everyone loved what they ordered, which almost never happens. I can personally say the chicken and waffles are out of this world and the beermosa is good (different but tasty in its own way). I could see that CTH would be an awesome place to watch the game, grab drinks after work, or start the night.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Danielle P.,"Stamford, CT",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,3.0,"Our group of 5 stopped by on a Saturday afternoon around 4:30 pm. There was a Caps game going on at the same time so the bar was packed and they couldn't take any more reservations for the night. Luckily, we found a seat in the second level tasting lounge. They were extremely busy and took a while to get the table cleared. When the waitress finally came by, she seemed really flustered and asked us to wait until she came back with water (10 min later) before taking our drink orders. I ordered a flight and was having trouble picking the fourth beer. I'm a fan of stouts or browns and I asked the waitress to recommend the last one. The darker Belgian she recommended was horrible. My friend also ordered it in his flight and had the same reaction. It would have taken more time to ask for a different beer so we sucked it up and chased it with the Deschutes Black Butte which was amazing.We ordered the fries and bacon popcorn to share. Both were ok, nothing to rave about. The popcorn is tossed in bacon fat rather than actual bacon pieces so you're left with a really oily mess at the bottom of the bowl. My friends ordered the burger, mussels, and french dip. They all seemed to like their meals and the portions were hearty. One of the orders was wrong and the entree came with fries instead of salad as requested. Overall, it's a fun place with a great atmosphere, but service and the snack items need some work. I'd give it another shot if we had reservations.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Kelly K.,"Washington, DC",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington

4.0,4.0,"The stunner was the Tartufo pizza, roasted nuttiness with the mushrooms and truffle oil. It was complemented by a runny egg on top for delicious creaminess. The beer list was also impressive, including pale ales and white ales and a special pumpkin beer to celebrate Fall-pumpkin madness! I found the restaurant quite loud even though we were seated in the dining area. Hope you come here with close friends because you'll be leaning in a lot. :) Sadly, the Korean short-rib tacos did not live up to expectations. The short-ribs were rather dry. The steak frites was also just ok, rather a small portion for $27. The accompanying duck fat fries did not quite capture the extra crispy sinfulness of duck fat. However, the sauces were quite excellent. I think they elevated the fries to be what it should have been by themselves.

4.0,2.0,"We really wanted to like this place... But after six (6) tries over the week, we were perpetually frustrated over the service issues. We figured we were cursed, and finally gave up and sought other beer bars in the area.The Story...The City Tap House was incredibly convenient to our hotel and we really liked the ambiance and look of the menus, but food was pricey and just OK.  Moreover, the staff were disorganized every visit. We were never able to catch the manager's eye, because he was too busy pointing around the restaurant and criticizing the staff about some foible in the dining room that never seemed to improve our experience.Pros:* Loved the Crab Mac N' Cheese appetizer (even at $14) - BUT wish we were given a fork to eat it. Server disappeared. Had to flag down the host, who had to flag down a busser, who had to find our server, who then got the food runner to find the fork  ;-(Cons:* Unprofessional hosting EACH visit * Slow and disorganized servers and bartenders EACH visit* Caesar Salad ($10) very small portion with minimal toppings* Three Little Pigs Flatbread ($14) - skimpy on toppings, pork uncooked & chewy* The Tap Burger ($16) - dry and overcooked* Bathrooms were a disaster EACH visit * Expensive beers - $7/glass for regular strength IPA... FYI: 14 oz. is NOT a ""Pint"" Pet Peeve: The 4-flight taster tray is more expensive than if ordered separately... So we ordered the beers separately (without the tray) over the entirety of our meal, and were still overcharged. We complained about this on three visits, but they simply shrugged their shoulders and said that's how the system is set-up  ;-(PS - Beware of double billing drinks for large parties, which we experienced twice.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Tony S.,"Durango, CO",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington

4.0,5.0,"Wow, just wow. First I have to say the service here is beyond awesome. My friends and I came here for Sunday brunch and had to wait for our table to be set up, in the meantime the manager took our ID's and got us ready for our bottomless bloody's/mimosas so we didn't waste any time. Then he continued to check up on us to make sure we were okay (not in an annoying way) throughout our visit, as well as our waiter who was awesome too!Next, the food and drinks... I've been here at least 5 times and it's never failed me. From the big chick sandwich, the wings, the crab hush puppies (omg), or the eggs Benedict on corn bread.. It has all been forgettable in the best way! And not to mention, the price point is quite reasonable! I've also never been to a bottomless where they stayed consistent on a good pour, and the happy hour is great too after work hours! Oh and if you order a bloody, don't forget the shrimp and/or bacon cause they're both worth the $2.

We were seated right away and the hostess had the presence of mind to bring us to a quieter section of the restaurant since we had a young child (10).  After a long day touring we were all starving and thirsty.  I was really thirsty and drank a lot of water but it seemed every time I looked at my glass it was full. I never even saw the server fill it up!  We ordered - and it seemed like before I could get through another water, the food arrived - they were beyond words. I am quite comfy right now in my full, happy place.

4.0,4.0,"Amazing service. Orders were placed promptly and food was prepared quickly. Appetizer took less than 10 minutes and entrees came 5 minutes after.To start, we ordered the fondue. It had a good consistency and was slightly sweet.  Great appetizer for two hungry patrons.For entrees, we ordered the Three Little Pigs flatbread and the Tap House burger.Both were good. The burger was well cooked, though the patty and it's toppings were under-seasoned (lacking salt).The fries were also slightly under-seasoned, and though hot, were also soggy and lacked a crunchy texture.The absolute star of the entire evening was the truffle aioli. I didn't get a chance to try the fried pickles, but toss the remoulade and serve the it with the truffle aioli. If they're as delicious as they sound, they deserve the aioli.The flatbread was wonderful. It was a great mix of fluffy bread, meaty meat, and cheese.For a tap house, they had fewer taps than I had hoped, but their selection was choice.Would give 3.5 stars (but not possible in Yelp), so 4 stars it is.

4.0,5.0,"I would like to first start off by thanking the staff at City Tap House, especially Pearson (General Manager), Ryan (Manager) and Justin (waiter). On the night of February 20, 2015 I had planned to propose to my girlfriend at City Tap House, where we had first met a year ago.  I had planned a surprise engagement and invited our closest friends and family.  I was originally going to propose in the bar area since it was closest to the front door like a surprise style. Since I had approximately 12 people attending the surprise engagement I wanted to iron out the fine details of how I wanted the engagement  to go, so I called to make a reservation for a table. I called City Tap House and I was told that I would only have the table for 45 minutes, as it was a Friday night during peak dining time and the table and already been reserved for a certain time. I agreed to the amount of time and kept the reservation. I was now along with my party on our way to City Tap House. I along with most of my party arrived and I advised the receptionist I was present. The receptionist told me that the table was only reserved for 45 minutes and asked if I would be okay with that. I had told the receptionist that that would not be a problem and that I just needed it for a quick meeting and dry run of my engagement. The receptionist caught that it was for an engagement and she quickly ran to get and spoke with the manager Ryan, who came out and greeted me. Ryan wanted to know who was going to propose and I told him that that person was me. I had set up the whole evening to surprise future fiancé, which all of our closest friends and family were in on it. I also told Ryan that I had several people coming from out of town, even flying one in just for the night. Ryan told me that I could have the table for as long as needed that night.  Ryan had also just recently proposed and empathized with me.  Ryan seated us at a table in the back of the restaurant near the kitchen were my large group of family and friends had plenty of space to meet and prepare for the upcoming engagement.  Ryan then introduced Pearson who was the General Manager. Pearson greeted and congratulated me and asked me if I wanted more privacy. Pearson told me that he could move my party to a private room all the way in the back of the restaurant. I thanked Pearson and Ryan and respectfully declined because the table had already been a bonus.  Pearson then brought out complimentary Champagne that was put on ice for the engagement. All of our friends and family that were invited made it and we awaited my future fiancé's arrival. My fiancé arrived and I proposed in front of our guest without a problem, it was truly a happy moment for me and for my now fiancé. The whole table toasted to our engagement with the complimentary Champagne. All my guest including myself and fiancé had a very delicious dinner, which was topped off by Pearson giving the entire table complimentary desert and even a personalized dessert, which was created by Justin just for my fiancé and me. The staff went above and beyond what was necessary to make our night extra special. I and my fiancé are sincerely grateful for the service we received and will always recommend this restaurant to anyone traveling to the DC area.

When he returned we placed our order asked for Lemonades. This guy literally passed us 4 times and brought out our salad before he brought out Lemonades (in which I had to remind him)... 2nd strike. Through out eating never came to check on us or anything. We flagged him over asked for boxes. He brought them over and again NEVER came back.

4.0,5.0,"I was looking for a place to have a late lunch in between museums in DC and this place was a god send. Great beer selection, tasty good, and nice wait staff; it is like the trifecta of an awesome place. I had the Southern Tier Pumking beer which came in a 10oz class and was only $6! What a deal since the beer is so strong. I usually try to be more adventurous when I'm trying a new place but I ended up just going with the Tap burger with avocado and a side salad. The bacon popcorn is a great appetizer to munch on while you sip your beer and wait for the entrees to come it. It's flavorful and rich but still light enough that it doesn't fill you up. I am embarrassed at how quickly I inhaled the bowl. I ordered my burger medium and it came out perfectly cooked! it had a nice crunchy sear on the sides of the burger and the caramelized onions on top had this awesome acidity that cut the fattiness of the burger. Side salad was the standard tossed in balsamic and oil, lately i just can't eat fries. The ambiance of this place is nice and cozy with a lot of room to come with a big group.

We loved it so much that we even had our rehearsal dinner there this summer. We have been to this DC location several times, including NYE, and it's always been on point. Great food. Great drinks. However, the last time we went (Summer 2015) we had quite a different experience from what we have ever experienced. The hostess forgot to give us our table, we never got a server, etc. however the manager seriously came through and more than made up for everything. He became our personal server, gave ice pops to the kids sitting at the table next to us, and just turned our experience from a buzzkill into a night to remember. This is why we love City Tap.

4.0,4.0,"""What's not to like?""Intro:  One day, I will start cooking at home.  I promise.  Anyhow, I've been to Tap House twice now.  Today was very chilly, so I wanted shortest walk possible.  It was between Tap House and Cuba Libre, so I went for the no brainer.Ambiance:  I really like the exterior and interior of this restaurant.  It is comfortable.  It's well decorated and I can see that the establishment takes pride in presentation in both interior decorating and food.Food:  So far, I've gotten the Cuban and the rye sandwich, both with the notorious ""duck fat fries.""  Duck fat may be the most intriguing menu item I've ever seen.  Something about it just peaks your curiosity.  They make for good fries.  They seem to be textured well without any overly crispy parts.  The fries are almost soggy, but in a good way.  They fries don't come with ketchup, but some other white, flavorful sauce. I used this sauce on both the sandwich and the fries. Both sandwiches were pretty good.  My Cuban had small, hard portion in one of the bites.  This was a piece of the bone and not some random object.  It reaffirmed that they were using authentic cuts of meat.  I am thankful that I did not bite too hard or swallow the bone or whatever it was.Customer Service:  The customer service was been spot on in both visits.  I sat at a table the first time and today I sat at the bar, since I was rolling dolo.  The bartender, Kevin, was friendly and helpful.  I did have an empty glass for a brief period, but he came by and got me straight without me having to ask.Conclusion:  This place hits the mark.  I'll be looking forward to trying more of the menu in the future outside of sandwiches and fries.  It's a smidge pricey, but this is the DC we live in these days.  If we continue to pay, the prices will continue to rise.PS:  I see now that upping my Yelp reviews is going to have a direct result on my health.  Hopefully, I can get in some sort of acceptable shape by summer.  Maybe I'll be writing a gym review soon.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Gregory B.,"Capitol Heights, MD",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,4.0,"I came here one day to grab some lunch. I like typical American fare so I figured I would find at least something to eat. The interior is pretty nice - we got seated against the wall in the elevated seats. It was an interesting view, though being on that size makes the place appear deceivingly small. I could only tell how big it is when I went to use the restroom. When we went, they appeared to be short on staff, which I think is a bit weird on a weekend, even if it was a Sunday. Our server was also manning the bar, though someone else came to pitch in by the time we finished. We both got burgers and I have to say, they were excellent. I thought they would be overly heavy and greasy (Bobby's Burger Palace has set the bar quite high for me) but they weren't at all. Comparable to Chef Geoff's, almost. Aside from the slow service and strapped staff, it was good. I would come here again if I'm in the neighborhood and need a place where I know they have a menu that I can find something I can eat from!",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Charlotte S.,"Silver Spring, MD",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington

4.0,3.0,"I wanted to love this place. Great location, killer beer menu, and good service. They really have the bones of something special here. But for the beer menu they have, they manage to screw up how they are served. Pint glasses aren't the best for high-quality beers, much less so when they aren't clean. The foam should stick to the sides of the glass. Apparently their glasses have some sort of soap residue on them to prevent this. The food didn't wow me either. It all tasted more of typical bar food than a special DC spot that they need to compete in DC.  Some grass-fed beef and organic options will bring things up a notch.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Valarie G.,"Camarillo, CA",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington

4.0,5.0,"A very random find, but city tap didn't disappoint and may now be one of my favorites in D.C... and that's really saying something! We called ahead at ~3pm on a Saturday and were afraid they wouldn't have a seat for a big party (of 6), but they got us a great table. Everything on the menu seemed delicious -- the goat cheese and honey flatbread with pistachio pesto (!) I ordered came out perfectly, and I even ate the crusts, which isn't something I do often. Ugh, and the duck fries. You must order the duck fries. I didn't get to try my friends' entrees, which ranged from lamb chops and soft shell crab to burgers, but everyone was licking their plates at the end and looking satisfied. They had a great selection of beer also, including samplers (3 for I think $14). Oh, and we were all in love with our server -- she was the funniest, sweetest and chillest 21-year-old waitress ever. There's a rotating menu of daily entree special on the menu here, so make sure to check that out. I can't wait to come back here on a Tuesday night to try their chicken & waffles!",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Sungmin S.,"Washington, DC",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington

4.0,4.0,"After reading the reviews I decided to give this place a go.  On a Tuesday night the place was pretty packed, but we were seated right away without a reservation.They handed us an extensive beer list, first couple of pages are beers on tap, and the last page are the bottles.  I decided to go with the Troegs Mad Elf, which has 11% alcohol.  It is a 10oz pour and tasted great!  The boulevard tank 7, was also great, even with 8.5% alcohol.  I always enjoy tasty beers with high alcohol content.  The list has a description of the flavors, and they even serve a smaller 4oz size if u wanna taste more beers.I was disappointed that they were out of the ribeye, so I ordered the steak frites, it was tasty and came presliced.  The truffled mash potatoes were so so tasty.  We also ordered the Korean BBQ tacos, which were awesome, and the Crab Mac and cheese, excellent!  The garlic sauce oysters were average, I wouldn't waste my time with them.Service was a little disappointing, but it was very crowded so I guess it is to be expected.  I would have definitely given this place 5 stars if the service was on point. If you like beer and hearty meals, definitely check this place out, you won't be disappointed.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Saam T.,"Arlington, VA",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,4.0,"I came here with a party of about 25 people and I was really impressed by our experience. Crowd control: First of all, this place knows how to handle a crowd. For those of you who have ever tried making a reservation for 20+ people, you probably already discovered that it's hard to find welcoming restaurants in dc. Most places cut you off at 12 people per party. Our party sat in the back room, it was great. The bar area looked really crowded though. I felt lucky to be away from that.Food: good God. Just come here and eat. Now. I had the Korean tacos, Mac and cheese, and I tried some pork that my boyfriend ordered. It was all amazing. The Korean tacos were loaded with juicy flavor. The Mac and Cheese dish was pretty large, and I stuffed it all down. Delicious creamy heavy Mac with a crust that doesn't overwhelm the dish.Beer: I love witbeers and this place had plenty to choose from, very much appreciated!!!! I am blanking on the name, but there was a ""golden beer"" that was fantastic and close to 9% alcohol.Service: no complaints. I'll definitely come back here. It's a safe bet to bring friends, coworkers, and family here. No one should leave disappointed. Yelp suggestion: there should be a filter for ""good with reservations of 20-30 guests"" option.

4.0,4.0,"After a full day of sightseeing in DC we were tired and all we wanted was a good beer and burger. Was pretty busy when we got there, but we were sat right away. Was a beautiful night outside so decided to sit on the patio. Great atmosphere, but because the tables are so close together, you don't feel like you have any privacy to talk without the other table hearing everything you say. Other than that the burgers were great! They have tons of beers to choose from, and the servers know a lot about them so you can ask them and they will tell you about each one.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Adam H.,"Washington, DC",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,2.0,"It's hard to create a sub-average burger, but this place did it. Ours was drippy greasy yet dry - suffering from no condiments. The fries were limp and greasy as well. When seated, we were put way back in a lifeless room after having passed numerous open tables that were for other (apparently more important) people as we were told - which no one sat at the entire time we were there.  The service was inattentive - asking for a 2nd drink was clearly an inconvenience. The food was dropped off in a rush without a word requiring us to grab him by a pinch of sleeve to ask for ketchup. The atmosphere was good with lots of TVs and the beer selection big.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Kent U.,"Seattle, WA",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington

There are tons of TVs, so you can always find a place to watch your game (even if your team is a bit obscure), the beers are amazing (craft-brewed), there's an awesome ambiance, the food is yummy, and the staff is super friendly.  They are reasonably-priced, too!I've been to a few events in the back room, on the patio, and one where the entire bar was rented out.  The back room can be closed off from the rest of the restaurant and is all exposed stone, so it feels private and not like you're at a bar at all.Highly recommended!",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,SaraAnn A.,"Washington, DC",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,3.0,"Generic interior, lots of street parking in the area. Slammed on a Friday night, but they were nice enough to reserve a few hours of the lounge area at the far end for our party. Service was moderately attentive, given how busy they were. Definitely come early, since the loud white-collar crowd runs CTH out of tastier craft beer pours before happy hour even ends. Decent whiskey list at reasonable DC prices. Real candles on the tables, as proved by someone we observed accidentally burning a napkin. Bar food and classic eats generally done right-- flatbreads have thin crusts, wings are moist and flavorful, and the moderately seasoned duck fat fries are just crispy enough. Fried pickle chips were just okay, battered until almost crispy and cut thicker than ideal. The smoked gouda fondue impressed more than the soft pretzel it came with, and more than the truffle aioli that came with the fries. I wasn't with a group of people in the mood for actual dinner, so we'll have to come back when I want decent food with my beer in this neighborhood and don't mind wrestling for bar space: oxtail shepherd's pie, rye French dip, twenty-four hour crispy pork shank, Korean short rib tacos, three little pigs flatbread, tartufo pizza w/guanciale, braised pork collar, seared scallops, corn & crab hushpuppies, arugula & quinoa salad; house smoked salmon hash, chicken & waffles; Red River Maple.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Ruth C.,"Washington, DC",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington

Luckily we made reservations because it was packed and there was a football game on. We hung out at the bar area beforehand and despite how busy it was, the bartenders were so efficient and very attentive.Once we were seated, our waiter was a rockstar. I wish I remembered his name so I could give a shoutout, but regardless he was a gem. In fact, all of the employees we interacted with were so pleasant! The manager even stopped by before our food arrived and chatted with us, which was really nice. There was one server who took his job very seriously with the way he got food out to the tables, and I had some serious respect for him and his efficiencies.Wings - OMG AMAZING.Elise mussels - YUMFrench Onion dip - Get in my belly.

Which is why I got a second order. I am a fry LOVER. So good. So good.Caesar Salad - I've had better but it was a basic Caesar. What more can I say? Mussels- I don't remember if we had the Elise or Abigail. I don't generally care for mussels so I'm not going give my opinion. Ten Spice Wings - I wasn't really wowed by these. They were just okay to me. Yellowfin Tuna Tartare. Let me first day that I  don't eat tartare. However, This. Right. Here. I'm convinced that other places just didn't do this dish any justice. But here. Oooh weee. This was really phenomenal. The best dish we ordered. It was truly perfection. If I had to come back based on service, I'd never return. Service was basically non existent. Dude yelled from another table that he'd be with me in a minute. Came about 10 minutes later but did not come all the way to the table. Tossed the beer menu onto the table.

We loved the 5 spice wings and ordered them both times. The first time I had the chicken sandwich and fries which is so far my favorite. Last weekend when I visited I had the openfaced softshell crab sandwhich with advocado and fries which was also good.

A+ for service!I got a Perrenial hopfentea beer and loved it. It has an aftertaste of mangoes and is perfect for the summer.We ordered the Korean short rib tacos to share and although the appetizer usually comes as a plate of three tacos, our waiter added a fourth for us. We all thoroughly enjoyed the tacos. They were juicy and well balanced.My salmon entree wasn't as satisfying. The consistency of the salmon was a little mushy and the bright orange color was off-putting.I had a few bites of my friend's steak frites and the flavor was incredible.

Their menu is a little bit unoriginal, which is refreshing. A suggestion for the picky eaters out there: heck out the menu before they go; everything is fab if you're willing to try it. From lobster rolls to crab hush puppies to short rib tacos to pizza to burgers, you can find any options. The servers are very nice and ready to let you enjoy the night! The beer selection is vast and thirst quenching. You can have a flight or individual. I recently had one (I forget the name), but it has a hint of grapefruit I believe. Very tasty.

4.0,4.0,"City tap house advertises itself as selling ""elevated, American pub food,"" and that's exactly what you get here, though I wouldn't say it's quite elevated enough to make it a prime date spot. More a nice atmosphere to come watch a football game. A classier sports bar is what they're going for. The menu is a bit of an oddity. It seems like they aren't quite sure whether they want to be a classy steak house, which really isn't justified by the atmosphere, or an elevated sports bar. An example: the entree section on the menu has several $30 plus options, including filet minion and sea scallops, plus one $14 burger. This atmosphere doesn't lend itself to all the fancy schmancy entrees in my opinion. If they added a grilled chicken sandwich and black bean burger, i guarantee they would sell like hotcakes.As you may have guessed, my date and I both got the tap burger. Thankfully, it was delicious. The onions have really good flavor, and you can add avocado for $2. The burger itself was also seasoned well and was thick and juicy. I'd put it behind BGR and Duke's Grocery but otherwise this might be my number three burger in DC so far. I consider that pretty high praise.It's served with a healthy portion of duck fat fries as well. Nothing wrong with that.For the appetizer we shared the crab mac and cheese. It did not disappoint. Not too cheesy, not too fishy (great balance of the fish and cheese), and it tasted fresh from the sea. It also had a nice crusty top that I kept going back for.City tap house is keeping up with the joneses with a nice beer list, about 40 on tap and a few additional bottles, and they take the effort to offer many different styles to please all pallettes. I had the creme brulee stout from southern tier brewery, which had pleasant roasty aftertaste, and though it didn't taste overly sweet, it smelled like the most delicious caramel candy I could ever imagine. I didn't want to finish it just so I could keep sniffing the glass like a creep. They aldo do daily happy hours, including weekends y'all. Nice.The service was on point throughout, and both the manager and GM stopped by at different times to see how things were going.

We ordered the fries (YUM - salty and crunchy and soft in all the best proportions AND it's served with truffle aioli), the yogurt and granola (ate every last nibble) and the chicken and waffles...stop the presses and eat, people!

Tried the crab, corn hush puppies, not bad, not to die for either. So far, solid 4. Wings, crispy, good sized, good flavor, lacking on the Scoville scale which would have made them great, but they ran out of Ranch. HOW? In God's good name as a restaurant do you run out of Ranch? Isn't that like one of the Cardinal sins even Pope Francis wouldn't touch? Even at home I don't run out of Ranch.

If you like mac and cheese, you'll love this dish.  Although at first I thought the consistency was a bit runny, the flavor was good and the crab was literally in every bite, well balanced dish.I got the Tap House Burger with an egg, and that was awesome too!  Burger was done medium well, medium well.  The egg wasn't runny but still soft enough for me to enjoy, some places will cook the egg sunny side up or over easy and have it run down your burger, which I don't mind, but the egg was good.This place may be a little pricey, but Washington DC is not a place for discounts being the city that it is.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Ryan P.,"Makakilo, HI",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington

My boyfriend and I were visiting DC and hit the International Spy Museum right before. We felt like having American (New) style food, and this place popped up online. I glanced at their brunch menu (being a Sunday around 1) and it was an instant hit between us. We arrived 5 mins later and was seated right away. It seemed steady, but not crazy. We pretty much knew what we were going to order. It was between a few different selections. We both pick one (which we usually agree with) and pair it with something else, so we get a little bit of different taste. With the help of our waiter we picked the honey goat cheese pistachio pizza and the salmon hash. Oh boy were we happy about our picks. The two dishes balanced each other. The pizza being a little sweet and salty and the salmon being savory. The portion sizes were good and I found very filling. That pizza though....I love their crust. My favorite type (soft, doughy, but thin), with a little flavor of everything in every bite, but wasn't smothered with ingredients.

4.0,5.0,"The beer selection was great, the food was even better! Came here on a Sunday night, had a few Hefeweizens and decided to try some of their menu. We ordered the crab Mac and cheese, scallops w risotto, and the black truffle mushroom pizza. Everything was extremely delicious, especially the crab Mac and cheese. The portions were nice as we had to box some of it up. I will definitely be returning here in the near future!",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Bryan N.,"Richmond, VA",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,5.0,"My husband and I dined here the night before Thanksgiving. The place was not too crowded and had a nice ambiance. The waiter was very knowledgable and enthusiastic about the menu. He was able to answer all of our questions without being too annoying. I ordered the Tap House Tuna Salad - yum! From the name, I thought it was tuna salad on a bed of lettuce, but its actually seared tuna on a bed of salad. Very delish! My husband ordered the French dip - amazing. the bread was not too crisp and the meat was not over done. The dip came with a side of fries which was yummy too. :)",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Bernadette A.,"Louisville, KY",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,3.0,"Rather pricey for both lunch and dinner considering it's a casual American bar, with food I don't think is that tasty. Everything on the dinner menu is above $30 except the burger or pizzas -- and the pizzas don't look good (they look like frozen pizzas). You'd be better off going to Matchbox or Pi for higher quality pizza in this neighborhood.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Michelle O.,"Washington, DC",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,3.0,Outside patio was a good spot to catch up with friends. Our waitrness only came by our table one time over the course of an hour -- and we weren't able to get a second beer because she never came by which I found strange. They have a large bar area in the inside and were hosting a massive group on a Monday afternoon that might have taken some of her attention away from the patio -- but seemed like they were doing a good business.,718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Brian G.,"Alexandria, VA",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
4.0,4.0,"City Tap House has redeemed itself!  They've removed the pickled garlic from the menu, and have replaced it with actual, tasty, tangy fried pickles.  I'm updating my review to let y'all know it's safe to go here again.  Most of my experiences there now have been excellent.  The beer selection is good and the drafts are cold.  The appetizers are filling and hit the spot.  I recommend the crab macaroni and cheese and goat cheese flatbread -- reasonably priced and filling.",718,"Washington, DC",City Tap House,Zelda S.,"Washington, DC",2027335333,/biz/city-tap-house-washington
