It's very hard to get reservations here in general, but I like to use the app \"OpenTable\" to make the reservations. It's so much easier to see what days/times they have available around your original search. Founding Farmers is located in Foggy Bottom, very close to George Washington's campus, making it very accessible to get there (walking distance from the metro). I highly recommend getting there early/on time because this place gets PACKED, especially for breakfast/brunch, and they will take your name off the list if you are more than 10-15 min late (I overheard one girl check-in for her reservation but since she was late they already filled her spot). Their waiting area is too small for how many people come in on the weekends, it gets very crowded near the entrance. They have an up-stairs and downstairs to be seated at; I've sat on both floors and personally like the top floor better because it's less crowded and noisy due to it being away from the entrance. Once you're seated, they have two menus. A menu specifically for breakfast/brunch and one for lunch/dinner options. You really can't go wrong with anything you order here, everything is so good (hence why they have 4 stars and over 6,500 reviews). My sisters have ordered the same thing every single time since they first came here a few years back because they love it that much. One orders the classic eggs benedict and the other orders the fresh strawberries and cream waffles. I have to admit their signature chicken pot pie really lives up to it's hype. I'm not one to have had many chicken pot pie's in my life before, but this was a game changer. It was SO CREAMY with big chunks of vegetables and chicken served with a biscuit on top. I have never tasted something so flavorful before, I don't know how they do it. We also ordered their cornbread (because I read yelp reviews highly recommending it) and I was very satisfied; the cornbread had chunks of real corn in it, still hot in the skillet - just the way I like it. I highly recommend anyone that visits the DC area makes reservations here to experience Founding Farmers, even if it's not for breakfast/brunch, it's that good.", "name": "\nAlexis C.\n", "location": "\nJamaica, NY\n"}, {"rating": "2.0", "review": "Loved the food, but felt that some ethics were not there. Fortunately, we got a bar spot very quickly - the wait is about 45 minutes even at 1PM on a Friday. As for the venue, it's definitely nice and clean. I loved the floating clouds!As for the food, the fried chicken was 5/5. Just amazing! The platter with the burger, corn, and hot dog was also delicious. I probably wouldn't order it again though since it's just a mix of normal foods. The cornbread was also delicious - a must order with that honey butter.The reason I am not rating higher is because I feel cheated. I asked for a side of pickles and they said I could order pickled vegetables. I said I don't want that - just the pickles to put in the burger. She said okay I can get the kitchen to get some for you. She never asked if I wanted to pay for pickles (no restaurant has ever asked me to buy small sliced pickles). I have no objection to paying but she made it sound like it was no charge. At the end of the meal, I was charged $4 for a small slices of pickles. I think that they need to be upfront and confirm that getting a side of pickles is a fee.

Definitely make reservations online beforehand, otherwise you might have to wait in line for a long time (we were able to make same-day reservations and got seated quickly). The decor inside was okay and it was kind of dark. Some of the tables were a little crowded together too. Service was great and we had a very attentive waiter. The prices here are actually very reasonable (most things are less than $12).For food, I got the breakfast chicken and waffles - I would give it a 4/5. I was a little disappointed when it arrived because I saw it had 3 very small pieces of chicken on the waffles (most pictures on here look like they have at least 4). Chicken was flavorful with good seasoning and not dry - tasted great with the gravy and sunny side up eggs! It's slightly salty on its own but if you combine it with the other stuff, it's just right. Waffle was light and crisp, and not too sweet, which I liked. My friend got the tomato florentine eggs benedict, which she liked but tasted just okay to me. One of the poached eggs was way overdone. We also got coffee for 2, which definitely could serve 3-4 people comfortably. The people next to us got stuffed French toast, which looked amazing - I'll have to try that next time!

I had reservations for 10:15am, we checked in at 10am and we still had to wait 25 minutes to get a table. After I saw that a group that came in after us got seated before us, I asked them why we haven't gotten seated yet and it was because the guy didn't even check us in -_-. Good thing I checked in with them a second time otherwise we would have had to wait forever. But we got seated right afterwards anyways. Food here is so delicious! I literally wanted to try everything on their menu, but we couldn't order too much because we had a lot of tourist things to do and couldn't bring food inside those places. They don't have a big selection of food, but the portions they give you are pretty big and filling. Strawberry stuffed French toast: OMGGGG BEST FRENCH TOAST EVER! I've never had stuffed French toast and now I don't think I will ever go back to regular French toast. The outer layer was crispy, but very oily =| I suggest sharing this dish because eating three pieces of extremely oily and fried French toast doesn't sit well with the stomach. The filling is a vanilla cream and it was delicious. Must find other places in LA that have stuffed French toast. Scrambled eggs with sausage and hashbrowns: my boyfriend ate the sausage and he said it was yummy. Their hashbrowns are pretty good, but not the best I've had, their eggs, HANDS DOWN the best eggs I've had at a restaurant. I think because the eggs weren't dry at all, and it had a good texture to it. Hangover hash: poached egg over hashbrowns and meat. I ate the poached egg and it was cooked to perfection.

They seat us at 7:10pm.When we initially got there, we browsed around the bar just to get a taste of the menu and see what the deal was all about. According to their staff, their menu changes based on the farmers harvest for that year... now that's freaking cool. I don't know why this concept isn't in California yet!Anyways, I ordered this amazing blackberry sour with egg white as my first drink of many drinks that night. What I really enjoyed about that drink was that it tasted like a whiskey sour, but it had hints of eggwhite (obviously) and blackberry (again, obviously), AND A HINT OF CINNAMON (WOAH DUDE).So we were seated promptly and got to our orders almost immediately. The chicken and waffles were just freaking calling my name man, I HAD to do it. We also ordered chicken wings and this amazing cornbread that came with a honey syrup... oh god.The dinner was absolutely phenomenal! The chicken was slapped with this amazing gravy and the waffles were Belgium styled (so that just means they're sweeter or whatever I guess) and good god. JUST STAHP. It was honest to god one of the most satisfying dinner's I've ever had.

The order came with a green sauce and a goat cheese sauce.We ordered a 14 oz. prime rib (medium) with green beans with candied lemon and the potato salad with pickled vegetables. For $28, it was quite the deal because the portions were massive. The prime rib was OK in flavor. It came with a side of gravy and horseradish sauce. The green beans and potato salad weren't that good. They had pickled cauliflower in the potato salad which gave the whole side a kind of stinkiness.We also had the seafood bucatini which my stomach was intimidated by because it was so big. The seafood included lots of mussels, half a lobster tail, a few shrimp and a piece of fried cod (think fish and chips). It was all very fresh. The sauce had diced tomatoes and a buttery-rich finish. The pasta was good but almost too much. It was al dente but it kind of clung to the bottom of the cast-iron platter. All-in-all, a great deal at $29 for this massive serving of fresh seafood.

Mike, our server, greeted us warmly and then Sam (perhaps the manager on duty?) came to our table and apologized for our wait. She even mentioned that she hoped the wait didn't ruin our experience. I thought that was a very nice gesture!I got the hibiscus soda and chicken and waffles, along with the cornbread for the table to start. Having grown up in the South, the cornbread was mediocre but I did like that it had real pieces of corn in it. However, it lacked flavor. The chicken and waffles was also underwhelming. While the portion size was good, the seasoning was very mild on the chicken and the waffle was rather hard. It essentially crumbled into pieces when I cut it. To his credit, Mike asked if we wanted our waffles cooked any special way and after tasting their \"default\" preparation, I would recommend asking for a soft waffle.After dinner, we considered dessert. Since one of my friends loves the beignets there, we went with an order of those and the chocolate ice cream. This was the highlight of the meal.

However, they were on the small side, about 2.5 inches or so in diameter, if you want to get numerical.My dad ordered the two crab cakes, with the mashed red potatoes and pearl pasta ($30), which was quite good, as the crab cakes were packed with chunks of crab and virtually no filler, about the size of pool table ball (but not the weight of one!!). The potatoes were velvety, and the pasta was great as well, especially the unique texture.My mom got the fish of the day, which was a wild-caught red snapper, potato salad and green beans ($28 - market price).

It was my first time here, but I've heard GREAT things about Founding Farmers. One particular note I heard again and again was to MAKE A RESERVATION before coming in. Once we got there, I completely understood! It was PACKED with people waiting to get a table! And on a Thursday evening for dinner, no less! I'll go ahead and break down my experience and explain why I absolutely do not regret this being our going-away dinner:Service: With our reservation, we did not have to wait long AT ALL to get a table. There were five of us total in our party, to which we sat in a booth seat on the second floor. Three of us were coming there for the first time. We wanted to go through EVERYTHING on the menu before making a decision. I know I kept stopping every few items to turn and ask my friend for his suggestion on certain dishes. Therefore, I really appreciate how friendly and patient our server was with dealing with us. She came by to check on us regularly, and was always upbeat. I never felt rushed by her. We had even asked for her to take a few pictures of us at the end of our meal, and she was so kind to help us out with that. Ambiance:Dinnertime at Founding Farmers has this cool, funky vibe--which is pretty applicable to life in the District anyway. I had a very \"Got off from work and want to spend time with friends\" feel, without feeling too underdressed or overdressed either (seeing as I didn't have time to change after work). The lights are dimmed, but not to the point where you can't see. Just enough to set a casual enough mood. The upbeat attitude from the servers made it really easy to feel comfortable. Food:I had ordered the Chicken Pot Pie, and it was absolutely amazing. The biscuit on top was delicious! It crumbled apart so easily, with keeping a crunchy exterior. The soupy part of the pot pie was so rich in garlic flavor. My friend kept reaching over to dip his rotisserie chicken in my soup! Another friend had ordered the chicken and waffles and was not disappointed at all! She loved it! Overall, we loved our food. That flavors were delicious. We also ordered a red velvet cake which we all shared and dug into. The cake was moist and dense, letting flavor really show through. It was absolutely amazing.

I was quoted a 45 minute wait time for a table of one, so I headed to the bar in hopes that I'd find a seat, and I'm so glad I did. I squeezed into the last empty seat and waited for 10 minutes before I got some water and a menu.I quickly decided on the steak and enchilada plate with a glass of Russian River Pinot Noir. The wine was an excellent choice and was poured for me very quickly. Food followed in about 10 minutes. The plate had a corn on the cob with some cotija cheese and seasonings, a flank steak with a cilantro chutney and two chicken enchiladas with a dollop of sour cream on top. The corn was delicious but a pain to eat because I refused to grab it with my hands, and wanted to slice off the kernels using a fork and knife. I spent about 3 minutes getting as much of the corn off as possible before starting my meal. The steak was cooked and seasoned well but I wasn't sure that it complemented the chicken enchiladas well. Also, the enchiladas would've been ever better with some extra sauce and spices.After finishing about 3/4 of the plate, I realized I wasn't full yet. Instead of finishing the plate, I decided to order another entree. There wasn't anything wrong with the original entree but I figured I came all the way here from out of town and this dish wasn't really mind blowing like I had hoped. So, with the bartender's recommendation, I ordered the shrimp and grits with a glass of their house brand rye whiskey. The shrimp and grits looked more like a stew, which was unexpected, but the flavors were really delicious! Also I had previously only had the shrimp and grits as a brunch item so was initially surprised not to see poached eggs on top. There were giant pieces of shrimp, chunks of veggies and really good grits that had soaked up the broth. The rye was legit, and my favorite from this trip.I would avoid lunching here if you're in a rush. But, I recommend it if you have a few hours for a leisurely meal.

Stupidly, we failed to make reservations despite it being a Saturday and it being such a popular restaurant. In our defense, as out-of-towners, we just thought it was a popular diner and who makes reservations at a diner? I should have done my due diligence and researched the place more. So, we had a solid 75 minute wait to be seated. The nice thing about being from out of town is that there's so much to see and do that it's not too hard to occupy yourself while you wait. \u00a0We wandered over to James Monroe Park and had a coffee across the street at Greenberry's.I will say that the hosts/hostesses were extremely nice. Despite how busy and popular this place is they all maintained their smiles and cheerful attitudes the entire time. No grumpy overwhelmed and burnt out hosts here. Kudos to them.We ended up sharing a fairly large table with another party. It wasn't too awkward as it was a big enough table we had a decent space between our two small parties. Normally, I would not be able to deal with that as I have an unreasonably large \"personal bubble\" and need my space. However, we had no reservation so beggars cannot be choosers. We were seated on the condition we would be done dining in 90 minutes as they had a reservation at that time that would need our large table. \u00a0It was not a problem as I've never been one to linger in a restaurant. \u00a0Frankly, people who linger in busy restaurants while others wait endlessly to be seated are rude and inconsiderate. Shut up, eat, and get out. You can yap endlessly somewhere else.My wife and I ordered the Founding Farmers Breakfast. \u00a0Basically, two eggs, choice of meat, choice of bread, and a side. \u00a0I ordered my eggs poached and they did an excellent job of it. My wife ordered the sausage and it was pretty bland. I opted for the bacon and it too was underwhelming. So, both of our meat choices were flops. We both also chose the Leek Hash Browns. \u00a0They had a good flavor but were terribly undercooked. \u00a0You have to put the brown in hash browns, people! \u00a0Overall, I'd say the food used high quality ingredients, but the flavor just wasn't there/ \u00a0My daughter ordered the Farmhouse Waffle and enjoyed it. \u00a0I'll apologize now for the syrup mess I am sure she created.Our waitress was just okay. She seemed exhausted and a little annoyed and I just didn't get a very welcoming vibe from her at all. Her mouth was saying all of the right stuff but her body language was screaming for us to leave immediately. \u00a0The only smile we did get was when she handed us the bill as if her last ditch effort at pleasantness was going to rescue her gratuity. \u00a0She should take lessons from the hosts on how to treat people.The restroom situation is not good. They basically have 4 unisex bathrooms. They're all one-at-time bathrooms. \u00a0Also, a lot of people are not aware there are bathrooms upstairs. Consequently, you have a restaurant as crowded as this with the capacity for only two people to use the restroom at a time. So, naturally, people are queued up to go potty.I think this place is a little over-hyped and overrated. There are three groups of people that once they find a restaurant that serves their kind of food and does a decent job of it they will then proceed to flood the web with 5-star reviews of the place. Not because the restaurant, comprehensively and holistically, is a 5-star establishment, but because their food sensitivity zealotry blinds them to all else. These three groups are (in no particular order): Vegans/Vegetarians, Gluten Free, and Green. \u00a0I tend to summarily dismiss their reviews the moment I realize they fall into one of those groups.This is certainly one of THE places to eat in DC and it shows.

His hashbrowns were not crispy and his eggs were very overdone. The ciabatta bread he got with it ended up being a pretty tasteless slice of bread.I had the classic eggs benedict. My eggs were so overdone that they were essentially hard boiled. There was minimal hollandaise which was no longer runny (aka: wasn't very fresh). The ham was just sliced lunch meat. I had it with leak hashbrowns. There was zero seasoning on them. They were crispy on the outside but soggy in the middle. I had to salt the crap out of them to eat half of them. I ate two bites of the eggs bennedict and gave up. Waitress never questioned why we didn't eat. I hate complaining and by that point just wanted to be done.

Our hotel told us at check-in to hurry, and they even hooked us up with a car to get there on time as they were impressed that we had reservation and would be able to get in to Founding Farmers. When we got there, the place was packed with people. I understood now how happening this place was. We were seated immediately upstairs and I was so glad we didn't miss our reservation.We made up our mind rather easily on stuff we wanted. My friend, Dita, made up her mind in the car when the bellman told her about the chicken and waffles. I kinda \u00a0wavered between the pot roast and shrimps and grits. I had shrimps and grits three nights in a row when I was in South Carolina earlier this week. I was tired of it but for some reasons also couldn't have enough of it. I had different version each night and glad that I ended up going with it here at FF as it was actually my best yet.The chicken and waffles were also some of the best I had. It was comparable to my fave at Table Fifty-Two in Chicago. The waffle just soaked in that awesome vanilla-y syrup. Oh.. It was great to see the syrup quickly disappeared as soon as you poured it. The chicken was fresh and it reminded me of my mom's chicken. They were tiny and not those broiler cuts at the grocery store.We also got fried green tomatoes to start and beignets for desserts. They were both delicious. Especially the beignets. It was worth the 25 minutes wait as they were big, fluffy, airy balls that tasted so good dipped in messy sauces of chocolate, caramel, and strawberry. It was so good that I admitted it tasted better than my homemade beignets. They were sugar glazed too. Balls covered in sugar. I just like balls in general, even without sugar coating it.After the tough travel day with delays and the fact I was at four different airports that day before planting my ass in a chair at FF, it was truly a great treat and a perfect start to our DC vacation. The cocktails were nice as well. Dita ordered a cucumber melon vodka drink and she switched it to my fruity strawberry vodka one. I loved that cucumber cocktail. It was so refreshing. The service was pleasant and prices were way reasonable. We didn't even break $100 before tip. We ordered shitload of foods! I came to learn this place had over 5300 reviews.

I REPEAT DO NOT COME HERE WITHOUT RESERVATIONS!! I came here once and was told the wait would be 45 minutes to an hour. It was around 8 or 9 at that time so I went somewhere else for grub. I made reservations for another time to come back, I'm a huge fan of farm to table so I wanted to see what Founding Farmers was about. I thought it might've been one of the first restaurants that opened up in DC like Old Ebbitt Grill but turns out it's only been around for about 10 years. This place must be crazy good then if the demand for seats are so high. When I finally came for my reservations, I wasn't seated right away.. I even came early and still waited at least 40 minutes. I thought to myself, \" Good food takes time, it's going to be worth it.\" When my name was finally called, I was brought upstairs to their booth style seating. I ordered the bacon lollis, prime rib with two sides which were kale and pecan candied sweet potato.The server mentioned to me that they had a special home made soda for the day and it was passion fruit, feeling intrigued I opted for it. Our food took a while to come and we started getting pretty hungry. Luckily the bubbly drink kept us busy. The bacon lollis weren't filling since they were so thin and it was about 4-5 pieces. The steak took a while but it finally came around, it was served with aujus sauce and horseradish sauce. The sides were so and so, I found the sweet potato to be too candied for my liking. The kale was worse, more like what kale?? It was mostly cabbage... and it was pretty tasteless.The main star was definitely the prime rib, the aujus sauce compliments it much better than the horseradish. During midway through our meal we ran out of sauce and wanted to ask our server for more but she was no where to be found. We stopped eating because we didn't want to eat the prime rib without the sauce. We kept looking around for her but she wasn't in sight at all. She hardly checked up on us, when we finally saw her we tried to wait for that \"eye contact\" moment but it never happened so we just politely waited. When she finally came around we got our sauce but it was frustrating that we had to wait this long.. When we finally wrapped up our main course we opted for dessert. We decided on the beignets, they sounded the most intriguing on the menu. Con? It would take about 30 minutes to make and have it served. (SO THAT'S WHY THE WAIT TAKES SO LONG HERE!!! DING DING DING) Luckily I had no other plans later in the evening so I was okay with the wait time. When they finally came, it was presented as powdered sugar donut holes served with 3 sauces. The sauces were raspberry, caramel and chocolate. My favorite was the chocolate. I wish the beignets were softer and less sweet since the sauces were already sweet enough. A few improvements that could be made at Founding Farmers is the service and wait time. Possibly hire more chefs or servers? I feel like they can't seem to handle the overwhelming amount of consumers. It was a long wait to get a table, a long wait for the food and a long wait for service.

That may have a lot to do with my experience.I made reservations for a party of 4, myself plus three out-of-town guests, earlier in the week prior to Sunday. I heard this place was a zoo, so I thought having reservations would help us navigate the crazy. Nope. If you make reservations, be there at least 15 minutes early, because that's how long it will take you to get seated.Once we got seated, it took forever for our waitress to come over and give us menus. It also took forever to get water, get our entrees, and get dessert. Overall, our dining experience was 2 hours long. Additionally, there were larger parties that were seated after us and left before us. We did not have any substitutions or weird requests, and we did not order appetizers. It took 20 minutes for a beer to get to our table, and over half an hour for dessert. That tells me either our waitress was new (she looked nervous) or there is something systematically wrong with customer volume management at this place.Now for the food. Considering how long it took for everything to get here, I did not honestly think the food was that special. It was tasty, to be sure, and I appreciate their commitment to farm-to-table. However, if people are spending a large part of their evening sitting around waiting for simple things like water and drinks, it better blow my mind, and I just didn't feel that way. My tablemates said the food was good, but it also did not seem to be special to them either.Considering the hype this place gets, plus the fact that this is supposed to be THE place to bring out-of-town guests in DC, Founding Farmers continues the pattern I've noticed of paying through the nose for underwhelming dining experiences in DC.

The fried green tomatoes were a big highlight with perfectly crispy fried tomatoes. The corn relish on top, like most other things we tried at the restaurant, were on the bland side and needed more flavor. The shrimp of the shrimp and grits was perfectly cooked but lacked flavor and the grits were really chunky with a tomato-based (and flavor-lacking) sauce.

Opted for the New York Strip Steak. It was good, but not the best steak I've had. It was definitely filling, though, The potatoes that accompanied it were really great though. Some parts were crispy and some softer, and I was all about it. My sister and her bf really enjoyed their dishes as well. I think he said it was the best pork chop he's ever had (will confirm). For dessert we had the blondie sundae and JESUS THAT IS SWEET. It was really good though - a slight deviation from the usual brownie sundae but still cookie/brownie-like and delicious. We finished every last bit of it despite how full we were. The prices here are heftier than usual restaurants.

I had previously marked The Pig for a dinner date with four other young ladies; but after the date was cancelled, The Pig was left to sit on my list for months before I had the opportunity to grace this four start establishment with my presence. It was a random Thursday when I decided it was time to sink my teeth into as much pork as my belly allowed (I'm in love with the Pigg-y!). We walked in to a very awkward space. I didn't immediately see the hostess, so we stood around like a couple of lames waiting for someone to greet and show us to a table. Anytime I have to look at my watch to note the seconds elapsing \u00a0is a bad situation. You may note it in my affective expression and in my tone that I am irritated and forming an opinion. After being handed the menu, I felt mildly confused. I had viewed all the photos on yelp, and felt confused when I saw that the menu was not as extensive as I anticipated. For some strange reason, I thought the waiters would walk around with roasting pigs on a cart, where the patron would be able to select a part. Maybe this would have been a better concept than offering small, barely there items that were under seasoned, vinegary and dry. The crackling and goat cheese appetizer was good, but would have been better had the pigs skin not been over fried. For dinner I had the pulled pork, mac & cheese and turnips. Let me preface this by saying I love turnips, turnip greens and bok choy. This was a vinegary mess of a dish and I politely sent it back to the kitchen. Its replacement was so forgettable that I can't remember it it give it a proper mention in this review. The pulled pork was okay, just not as flavorful as I imagined. You know, I don't have the highest standards for pork dishes. Pork has a high fat content, so I expect the meat not only to be tender, but flavorful WITHOUT a ton on seasoning. You don't have to do a whole lot to make a pork dish taste like something. So, the fact that the pulled pork, at an establishment call The Pig, didn't have pulled pork that was amazing is quite disappointing. To this point, my husband, who has the most basic palate in the world (probably not an overstatement) didn't enjoy the food and confused about why I suggested The Pig. smhOur waiter, although very nice, was also negligent. Disappearing for long periods of time and forgetting to refill our drink orders was unacceptable in my opinion. I hope this was purely a fluke night.

The service was great, the restaurant was full when we arrived, so a server converted a six person table into a table for 2 by removing some slats, so we wouldn't have to wait. Firstly we were given a complimentary amuse Bouche of pork crackling with goats cheese and pickle, very nice. I ordered the bbq dinner, which included bbq pork butt, cabbage coleslaw and Mac & cheese. It was delicious! The sauce on the pork was really tasty with a homemade sauce & didn't just taste like bbq sauce from a bottle like some BBQ! My husband had the burger, which was huge, he really liked it and and the burger bun but found the chips a bit crunchy \u00a0abs overcooked. We were too full for dessert but they sounded amazing.

Luckily you will be distracted by the good service and great food to notice. When my group came in the place was already pretty packed. We were smart enough to make reservations (factoring in both Valentines and Presidents Day weekend) and were sat instantly.

Very fresh and sweet. If you want something paired with the pork, choose the SHIRAZ from Australia! SPICY PIG TAILS: Super fatty. The texture is gummy and soft so if you're not into that skip over this. But if you want something new and don't mind a tiny bit of tang in the sauce, go for it.WAGYU TAR TARE: This was a surprising treat. It does not taste like raw meat at all - the saffron ailoi and the shallots blend perfectly for a light appetizer. Very subtle but delicious.PORK SHANK SPECIAL: $25. Worth every penny. Split it with a person if you're a small eater. I split this with my friend and between the two apps and my side, it was more than enough. The pork is cooked so well - tender and juicy with a crispy layer of skin on the outside. The rub on the skin is a little salty but pairs well with the sweetness of the pork.SIDE of MAC&CHEESE: Small portion for the $7.50 you're paying but if you need a more subtle flavor to cut the kick of all the pork then this is the dish for you. The crust has truffle oil. Need I say more?STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING: Yes. Yes. and Yes. Small little toffee pudding that comes with a side of this sweet creamy sauce you can pour over it. Worth the price despite serving size - you will be so full by the time you get it that you'll be happy you only had one bite. Nope I take that back. Make room for it and get your own.

When a place specializes in whole animal, I have this expectation that they're going to be pushing out dishes that are unstoppable. While the Pig was a decent place, with a friendly staff, MY personal expectations on the food fell a little short. The atmosphere is a casual, rustic, southern(y) feel to it. I like the lay out. My wife and I had Thrusday reservations for 5:30 (they called to confirm our attendance) but we actually got off of work a little early so we decided to take advantage of some of the happy hour specials. \u00a0The happy hour specials have some trimmed down entrees, as well as some exclusives (the ham and biscuit), and apparently the adult beverage specials are only available at the bar as well. Since we were at the bar we decided to try a variety of the appetizers (or small plates) rather than digging in to an entree. This might have been our mistake (or maybe it wasn't).We started off with the happy hour exclusive biscuits and bacon. What comes are three nublets that exquate to about the size of a full biscuit, with a few pieces of fried bacon/pork, and pork butter. I thought it was a decent tasting appetizer. Something that doesnt sit too heavy for the rest of your \u00a0meal, while still getting that pork inspired salty taste. My wife didn't like it as much as I did (a theme for the night). The second taste was the apples wrapped in bacon. Three wedges of green granny smith apples, wrapped in medium well done bacon. The salty and sweet work well together. I like my bacon medium (and not crispy) but I think this once would have been an opportunity for a more well done bacon to contribute to the flavor and texture. After this, we tried the face bacon ( at the recommendation of the bar tendress). One slice of thick fatty bacon. A little less flavorful than a pork belly, but along the same lines. My wife (not a fan of fatty pieces) excused herself after the first bite. After those three small plates we were pretty sure we wanted to move on to something bigger. Some of the large plates. My wife wanted to move away from the swin and in to the beef realm so she decided to go with the burger (80% beef, 20% pork mix IIRC), and I wanted to try a sampler. The Little Pig sounded like an opportunity to try a variety of things so I went with that. \u00a0The wife's hamburger was pretty good. It was well done so the outside had a nice flame char and came with a decent bun and a nice aoili. The Little Pig came out the biggest disappontment of the night. \u00a0A carving board. Half of the board had pickles, pickled onion, and pickled peppers and two pieces of bread. The other half had a homemade ham, a spicier salamish deli cut meat, and a pulled pork / pate kind of thing. I'll be honest, it was pretty underwhelming, maybe my expectations were too high, or maybe it was an offnight. The home made ham was... less than impressive, the pate was ... not good. At least at that point, having had a number of bacons, and various porks the last few bites of the pate left me feeling ... over saturated.", "name": "\nChris S.\n", "location": "\nWashington, DC\n"}, {"rating": "5.0", "review": "I have the good fortune of working mere blocks from what I consider to be one of the more solid restaurants in D.C., yet I'm realizing I've yet to pay it respects with a review. Thanks, reminders at check-in! So Fridays, a coworker and I have lately been making a habit of The Pig's lunch, which has become a highlight we both anticipate eagerly each week. Both the lunch and the bourbon happy hour (which, by the way, is a generous 4-7) offer some of the best meals in the city when it comes to quality per dollar paid. Let's start, and end, with the burger, both because it's my standby here, and because the chefs just changed the recipe yesterday, so it's perhaps the one modicum of differentiation I can provide from the other 600+ reviews. I've been eating this burger since The Pig opened, and it's always delicious. It's also one of the best burgers in the city, and that's not a compliment I give it lightly. The bun is solid enough not to melt away with the juices from the burger, yet not so substantial it becomes overwhelming. Pickled onions add a crisp crunch and a nice punch of acidity, with the added bonus of having milder after-burps than raw. And then there's the meat. Although really I should say, there are the meats, because the juicy burger itself (and I really can't help you if you order it cooked beyond medium - that's on you) is out of this world. Or was, until yesterday, when the recipe was changed to 80% beef, 20% pork. Kyle, another fixture at The Pig*, explained that the quality of pork coming to the restaurant had been so high lately that the chef felt obliged to use it as often and as pervasively as possible. The result is a rich meatiness that could sway even the crunchiest vegan. What elevates this burger to intergalactic levels is that on top of all of the aforementioned deliciousness, the burger gets a succulent layer of face bacon, which adds both crispness and complexity of flavor to the whole experience. In case you're still hungry, or merely curious, face bacon is available \u00e0 la carte as well.

We received a complimentary stuffed pepper of goodness- couldn't even tell you what it was in it other than pork (of course!). So good. We tried the face bacon for an appetizer, omg pure goodness. For meals, we had the Heritage Duo (pork tenderloin and sausage) and Grilled Pork Chop. Both were awesome and complemented with the perfect side dishes. I absolutely loved the orange hints and flavoring of the duo! Finally for dessert- we tried the doughnut...OMG! The doughnut was absolutely heavenly- to the point of licking the bowl! TJ was kind enough to send me home with the drizzle that went on top of the doughnut! Amazing! If you are in DC and want a good spot, don't pass this place up.

What a burger!I was staying in a hotel nearby and I didn't want to go anywhere far to get my dinner, so I went to The Pig and tried it out. Originally I was going to get something to go since I was going to get up early the next day, but there was a spot at the bar with a great beer menu so I sat down instead.I scanned through the dinner menu and I pretty much liked everything. However, I wasn't going to stomach a pig (or half a pig) the night before a 10-mile race so I ordered \"The Burger.\" Based on my profile pic you know I am a sucker for the word \"The.\" The chef gave every table a sample prior to the meal (stuffed pepper with pork on balsamic vinaigrette) which was a great small dish to get you started for the real meal.The Burger -- 80% beef, \u00a020% pork; face bacon, habanero mayo, gouda, red onion, fries... all for $18. I ordered a medium (I should have ordered a medium rare but I wasn't sure.) The burger was tasty and well-balance with sweetness (habanero mayo), smokiness/fattiness (face bacon) and juiciness (patty). The face bacon was *out of this world* and there was so much going on in one bite. The portion was very generous but they used a brioche so it could be a little messy, especially if you cut the burger in halves. The fries were well-cooked and the dipping sauce was tasty as well.The burger paired well with the brown ale I ordered (Oliver from Maryland) and everything was perfect. I told the bartender to tell the chef how good the burger was and he went straight to the kitchen to tell him, that showed how much they valued customer's feedback.I looked at other dishes around me and they all looked great!

But with numerous recommendations from my co-residents, I decided to invite my bestie and her boyfriend for a double date. My husband and I were first to arrive and were seated promptly. The ambiance was far from what we expected from their website (dark, chic gastropub), it instead reminded us of Hill Country BBQ (much more laidback - outnumbered by large families with kids). Although my bestie and her bf arrived closed to 45 mins late, our server was more than patient with us and allowed us to wait for our guests before ordering. Among the 4 of us, we decided to share 8 small plates (our server recommended 3 plates each but we were stuffed with just 2). Meatballs, ribs, face bacon, wild boar berries, Prochetta, and pig tail soon swamped our table. Meatball - flavorful but not too unique. Loved the squid ink gnudi and wished they offered it as an actual side! Ribs - wasn't a big fan of their barbecue sauce. It tasted like straight ketchup. However the ribs were juicy and well made! Face bacon - beyond amazing and definitely well worth the calories. At first glance, i thought I would just be biting into pure fat, but instead it was quite meaty and light! The maple glaze - genius. I should have ordered 8 of these babies. $5 each? What a steal! Wild boar - the boar was tender but could use more seasoning. The red wine sauce was underwhelming and berries didn't contribute any flavors to this dish. I did however love the cheese grits underneath. Prochetta - my least fav dish, dry and one dimensional flavor (salty). Pig tails - I would have thought they were ribs but instead these were much better! The spicy BBQ sauce had an amazing Asian kick. The Bleu cheese sauce was the perfect condiment. Although we were stuffed - Complimentary house made bread with peanut butter lard was too hard to decline. We must had refilled and devoured at least two baskets. And As if we didn't have enough to eat, we also made sure we didn't skip desserts - peach cobbler and toffee pudding - well worth the indulgence!

It was 8 of us & we opted to sit outside. It was about 530 pm. The table was open and it seemed convenient enough. We ordered the Big Pig charcuterie board and most of us had the Chili Margarita, others had beer. Let's start with the food.Food: The charcuterie was mediocre, the cuts didn't look or taste fresh. There were 4 assorted cuts, 3 half pickles, some skimpy dry looking carrots and just a sprinkle of zucchini with sauces. For $42, I don't think the quality was what it could have been. Service: Here's what earned this restaurant only two stars. One other colleague joined us so I went inside to ask if we can bring out another chair. The girl at the podium said no because of some kind of DC code that only permits them to have a total of 8 people sitting outside. Ok fine. It wasn't even that she said no but the way she said it, just rattled off the \"policy\" without offering a solution. It wasn't until I asked what else we could do that she said she could check if they had a table for us inside. At that hour the restaurant was 3/4 empty, but she said she would need to check. So she checked with her manager, Devan, who came over and explained that she did have a table and could move us inside. Great! So I went outside and told the rest of our group. Everyone started to get ready for the move when Devan came back and informed us that \"you can only have the table until 7 because it is reserved for another group at that time.\" Basically she let us know we would have to vacate the table in an hour. We had only ordered the charcuterie and some of us were planning to get dinner so we likely needed more than the hour. This might have also been ok if it wasn't for her demeanor. She said this without much tact or even an apology. No sense of customer service whatsoever. It was as if she could care less about the experience we had at her restaurant or the fact that we were being inconvenienced. She was short and not courteous at all in the way she handled the situation. Needless to say, we did not feel welcome so we decided to leave. Having dined at many restaurants all over the U.S. I've come to really value service. I think it is a key component and a determining factor in a customer's experience. So I can't say enough about how much a simple smile and a more tactful/pleasant approach & demeanor would have done to change the outcome of our visit. Devan, if you're reading this, next time this happens remember that while a persons experience at a restaurant is about the food it is GREATLY about the \"experience\" that customer has.

As my husband put it, he could eat the butter by itself, and so could I. We also ordered the sausage board, which is PLENTY of meat for two people. The umami mustard is out of this world and really took the meat to another level.We opted to share the 6-course Thai Pig Menu. This was a very solid choice. It was also plenty of food to share (for two), especially when you order a few starters.These aren't the exact menu item names, but I'm doing my best from what I wrote down: a deviled crab egg (we could have eaten a dozen; you're served one), crudite veggies from the restaurant's farm with a tomato-type sauce (this was AMAZING, I'm not doing it any justice), a cold beef salad, beef coconut curry with noodles, pork loin served over rice (very spicy, IMO) and coconut sorbet to finish the meal.I think my only wish is that I had experienced more meat in a purer form. Aside from the sausages, most of the dishes were intricate and flavorful - not a bad thing. Then again, I should probably have just ordered a delicious piece of pork if I wanted pure meat :)The service was excellent. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu.

But I'm torn on how to rank it. It doesn't fit into any neat categories. Let me explain: This might be due to their marketing style, which is based around The Line. Or their over-hyped reputation in national PR ratings of restaurants. In any case, my expectations were very high for coming here on a random Thursday for dinner service. The Line (The World Famous Line around the block) wasn't that long, to be honest. You could easily walk up and get at the end of the line. There were always open tables while we were at the restaurant. And I would suggest that if you really had to eat here, if you come early and sit right away, you will but guaranteed a table--albeit you will have to wait an hour while the kitchen ramps up. That's for a random, not-special-in-any-way weekday.The line is slow moving because everyone needs to learn how the system works. You request a time, they give you a call, if you don't come within 15 minutes you will lose your \"reservation\". If you do come within 15 minutes (we came in about 5), you might still have to wait a few minutes longer which is what happened to us. But it was only 10 more minutes of standing around.We started with drinks. The drinks were poorly described on the drink list and we were not wow'd with what we received. A bourbon drink came with a leaf in it. My wife got a drink that was more like a sweet smoothie.This is probably a weird comment, but I really liked the water. It was nicely filtered. I can't stand it when restaurants skip this easy step. This being a celebratory dinner and big splurge for us, we ordered almost everything on the menu to share and taste. Dishes were prepared well, but the portions weren't all that enticing for the price. They were also a bit bland. For instance, we ordered a curry plate that was probably the best prepared dish of the evening but it just had okay flavor. Dishes like the pork butt were really great and inspired, but it was still just pork butt for $30. The brisket was fatty and unimpressive. The brisket came with some pretty terrible bread as well. The deserts were pretty much not that thrilling either. We tried all of them. I got corn brulee which was okay I guess, but nothing that special to rave over. The foods were pretty well prepared, but at that price point I've had better. Some things were unique (strawberry spaghetti) but not so crazy as to be all that interesting for a second round.And that's the problem with Rose's Lux, it was pretty good, like...high end bistro good. But it wasn't a high end, high class, high service restaurant that I was expecting and am used to. It's barely even in the \"expense account\" range of restaurants that typically market to this price point. The prices were high-ish, but the line thing is a pain in the butt. And so is dedicating my entire evening to some hipster chefs 15 minute warning calls. So it sort of falls into a no-man's land of homecooked-style, interesting, but not incredible dishes. The service is pretty good, not incredible. The restaurant was interestingly decorated, but not high end either...more like a nice house. They appear to do everything themselves, really putting heart and soul into it. I think you can see that in the staff, the kitchen, and the ambiance.It's the love and caring that they clearly infuse into everything at Rose's that makes me want to give them a 5-star rating. But for the price, the marketing, The Line, the bistro quality of food, I just can't do it. Not when the bread sucks. Not when the drinks are boring. But they change it up so much at Roses Lux that I hope a future visit will change my mind and put them into the 5-star territory.

One in our party was willing enough to get in line at 4PM to put our names down when they opened. We ended up getting seated around 730PM and were able to sit in the upstairs section by the window.The decor is sort of a shabby chic meets SoHo farmhouse - nothing crazy, but a generally interesting and comfortable place to be. The lighting is a tad dim in the evening, and though there are candelas on the tables, I would prefer a bit more light to better see the food. Staff is extremely friendly and actually provide good banter - this is one of the great strengths of this place. They're very helpful to explain the dishes and are very accommodating if there are certain food allergies or aversions. Do take note that the menu here is relatively short and succinct, so there may not be as wide of a selection for pickier eaters. There are generally about 10-15 smaller plates (think tapas size) and several larger \"family\" options. We ended up just getting just about all the small plates available for our group, and it came out to be a good portion.1. Rock shrimp ceviche - has an Asian-y twist to it with cilantro, peanuts, tomato, and a lime-y dressing2. Summer veg panzanella salad - a variety of small slices of vegetables and bread throughout3. Grilled avocado - has an interesting blend of tomatillo and poblano with cotija blanketing it on top4. Pork Sausage bowl - has lychee, habanero, peanuts, coconut creme, crispy garlic, etc. for a total of 15 ingredients in one bowl ... their most popular dish5. Hangar steak - this has an Asian flavor with eel sauce and scallion garnishes6. Crispy softshell crab - this was probably the most visually interesting plating of the night7. Spaghetti with strawberry sauce - a sweet sauce with a kick, very interesting8. Pesto creste-style pasta - probably my pick of the pastas9. Bucatini with sungold tomato sauce - a bit tart, straightforward pasta... a couple more I can't exactly rememberWe also got a couple of the desserts - the eggplant tarte tatin being the standout for its uniqueness yet familiarity. Almost seemed like a normal fruit tarte tatin.There isn't a fault in any of the dishes at all in the way they are executed. Everything was prepared and cooked very well, and they all tasted great. However, there wasn't anything that was mind-blowing or exceptional that lingered with me. There wasn't any one dish that I just craved and wanted more of, and maybe that's just the difference in my personal approach to food. Rose's calls itself a neighborhood restaurant, but in my opinion, it's fancified straightforward dishes in small plate sizing. The wait times/policy, portion sizing, pricing, and a semi-upscale take on food doesn't quite translate to being an approachable neighborhood establishment for the community to me. It's not necessarily what Rose's is doing wrong, but maybe it's something they're not doing to speak to the \"neighborhood-ness\" they want to embody.In the end, definitely go and try Rose's if you get a chance - you will have an enjoyable meal.

And for pastas, the bucatini is currently the best one they have and it's just so creamy and cooked to perfection! Between my friend and I, 4 dishes was enough as they also gave us a sample of the strawberry pasta (not as good as bucatini) and the cinnamon French toast ice cream (in lieu of the foie gras French toast). Also, their craft cocktails are as much as 1 dish, so if you're really hungry and want to eat more food, I would suggest not getting one.

They don't take reservations. People start lining up at 3pm or earlier. They open at 5pm. They are closed on Sundays.I have been wanting to go, well, since 2014. My friend and I decided to finally go. We picked a Tuesday (hoping for shorter lines than the weekend crowd). We arrived at 3:30pm and were about 10th in line. WOOHOO! We were so excited to know we'd get seated!Oh yeah, I should tell you that I tried going once before, but I arrived around that same 3:30pm time, but on a Saturday. The line was LONG! We stood in line until they opened at 5pm, only to be told that we would not be able to be seated at all that night. Very disappointing. We had a great meal at Cava Mezze next door (that's what you should do if you don't get in). But still, didnt get to try Rose's.So, back to the Tuesday visit. We brought some adult beverages with us to enjoy while waiting for the restaurant to open at 5pm. Then the time came! It was a beautiful evening and there were seats available on the patio. YUP, we sat there. Not only was it nice to sit outside, but also interesting people watching as folks continued to wait in line. haha.Here we go:Food: The food was unique and delicious. You know what one of the most memorable dishes was?? The complementary bread that they bring you. Holy cow, the freshest, most delicious bread I've ever had. it comes as a mini loaf. and let me tell you, the two of us almost ordered a SECOND LOAF because it was just that good. But, we wanted to try as much of the menu as possible so we controlled ourselves...and instead just finished the one loaf. hah.My 3 favorites (other than the bread) were the pork sausage and lychee salad (tons of flavor, so well balanced); the softshell crab with bloody mary vinaigrette (even if you don't think you like softshell crab, get this. You'll like it); and the ice creams for dessert (captain crunch ice cream...it's legit). Drinks: We each wanted wine. Our server was great at giving us recommendations based on the type of wine that we described that we wanted. She let us try a couple. You can't pick wrong-- they're great wines. Atmosphere: Lively, homey, and everything has a reason. Did you ever read that article about how even choosing the soap in the bathroom was a thorough process? They did a great job on everything. It's inviting exciting. Service: Our server was wonderful. In addition to suggesting wines, she also sent us complementary mac & cheese pasta (not on the menu). I think they send every table a free dish, but still, a nice gesture nonetheless. Food came out quick enough but not too fast. We felt well taken care of but not bothered.Price: Pretty typical pricing for a classy DC restaurant, but still a bit pricey. Worth it? ABSOLUTELY. Just not somewhere to go if you're watching your pennies.Before coming here, I always wondered if waiting in the line was REALLY worth it. Like, even me, a huge food lover, knows it's still just food. But you know what? Waiting in line is part of the whole experience. You chat with your friends, maybe with the people around you in line. And enjoy not being at a desk at work, or running around doing errands. It kind of forces you to relax and unwind before sitting down to a great meal.I'd say go on a weekday if you can.

Named \"Best New Restaurant of the Year 2014\" by Bon Appetite (as in, best in AMERICA, not just the DMV), I was beyond excited to finally try Rose's Luxury. Sometimes, however, a lot of hype can actually be detrimental...if, for instance, a place doesn't quite live up to the glowing recommendations and you walk in with sky-high expectations. Rose's was not bad by any means, but it also wasn't the memorable, awe-inspiring, life-changing meal that all the hype promised me! At the end of the day, I'm gonna have to be honest and say that to me, while Roses's is cutely decorated with great service and some very innovative plates, it is overrated. I think the biggest issue with the food was consistency - The small plates ranged from amazing to not so great. We tasted:- Bread loaf w/butter: Complimentary warm bread with delicious soft whipped butter that was meant to taste like a potato skin! The soft pat of butter was covered in scallions and a light dusting of potato skin crumbs. I know it's just bread/butter but it was a really good start to the meal! The bread definitely tasted fresh.- Pork habanero lychee salad: Their \"signature dish,\" this was by far my favorite part of dinner. Really robust, interesting combo of flavors, with bits of salty pork sausage and sweet lychee in every bite! Def get this!- Avocado with cotija cheese: This was on the house! Yay for free goodies. However, just not worth it. Nothing special at all. I would not opt to order this for $12 (it is half an avocado).- Hanger steak with Japanese mustard and eel sauce: Well executed but not unique/memorable. Perfectly medium rare and very tender. The sweet eel sauce made an interesting accompaniment. - Soft shell crab with sweet corn: Idk maybe I'm not big on softshell crab but this was just ok...The lightly-battered crab quickly lost its crispiness from the vinagrette that was served with it. Sweet corn underneath was just savory enough, though, and really good.- Penne alla vodka with shrimp: Maybe we were full by this time, but this dish didn't do it for me. The sauce was extremely rich, heavy, and too sweet. We didn't finish this dish (for me, the sign of a really amazing meal is when you want to keep eating even when you're full, just because the flavors are so outstanding).- Corn creme brulee: omg YUM. I loved this dessert. I love creme brulee and I love corn though, so maybe I'm biased. It was not a very sweet dessert...almost savory, but not overwhelming. For an extra bit of sweetness it was served with mascerated blueberries on the side. Had the taste of creamy cornbread.The restaurant is really pretty inside -- I liked the eclectic, hipstery decor, with lots of light wood and strung lights above the tables downstairs. It's a cute spot for a date night. FYI Rose's does not take reservations and is only open for dinner, so if you'd like to make the first seating at 5:30, you should get there early to stand in line (which I'm told can get pretty long on weekends)! If you arrive after 5:30, you can put your name down and they will text you when your table is ready. TIP: There's also a SEPARATE list for the bar seats!! I definitely recommend putting your name down for a bar seat if you're with a small party, as that wait is much shorter usually. We were seated at the bar in 30 minutes (the wait for a table was 1.5 hours).

Our favorites were the crispy softshell crab with blood mary vinagrette, the pork sausage, habanero, and lychee salad, and the rock shrimp ceviche with crispy plaintains. While the softshell crab quickly lost its crispiness from the blood mary vinagrette, it was so soft \u00a0with enough textural contrast to the polenta and the vinagrette underneath. It was just a dish that was so well harmonized. There were pieces of celery leaf in there that scented the dish and elevated it very well, I think. The pork sausage and lychee salad was amazing. I expected it to be sweet from the lychee but the lychee actually cut through the fatty sausage. It was served with raw red onions and habanero, which also balanced out the sausage with the spicy and crunchy notes. Finally, there are peanuts in the dish with a dressing of coconut milk that gave a nutty balance. Every bite was pleasantly surprising and delightful. The rock shrimp ceviche was served with what tasted like orange/lemon and corn vinagrette. It was so light and a perfect dish to start. The rock shrimp was plump and paired very well with the cilantro. The fried plaintains were like light fritos. We also ordered the special of the day (penne pasta with shrimp served in a ragu of some kind) as well as the smoked brisket. I don't recommend either of these dishes. The pasta dish was nothing special (despite its namesake) and the smoked brisket was SO heavy. If you love eating fat, this is the dish for you (think bone marrow). But I thought it was just heavy without any redeeming features. For dessert, our waitress gave us complementary vanilla ice cream with olive oil and sea salts. This is THE perfect dessert! I hope Rose's Luxury includes this in their dessert offerings. This is one of those eureka dishes that makes so much sense when you taste it. The olive oil was fabulous and must have been very good quality because it rendered vanilla ice cream to be exciting. The sea salt provided that sweet-salty combo that is just amazing. I want a tub of this now!Be warned that Rose's Luxury seems to love cilantro. If you are not a cilantro fan, please speak up. So I know that people debate about the strategy for Rose's Luxury. I am one of those people who HATES waiting in line. I rarely go to any restaurant without a reservation, and I don't remember the last time I waited in line for more than 10 minutes. Nonetheless, it was becoming embarrassing to call myself a foodie without having been to Rose's. My friends and I waited in line from 4:15 (on a Saturday) and was guaranteed seating when the restaurant opened. I would definitely come back for the 45 minute wait to try the 4 dishes I listed above. Finally, our waitress was very insistent that we order 3 dishes per person. When we ordered 4 small dishes and one family dish, she insisted (again) that we need more as the plates come out small. I was initially bothered by how pushy she was being - I think Rose's want a fast turnaround so that diners don't order additional dishes toward the end of their meals. However, the service afterward plenty made up for it. But DON'T BE PRESSURED TO ORDER 3 DISHES PER PERSON. I noticed that several restaurants in Eastern Market recommends 3 per person (Cava and Ambar, for example). We couldn't even finish the 5 dishes that we ordered and we eat like normal women.

Everything had a rustic feel to it! Sit in the back or in front of the kitchen to watch the chefs hard at work! On to the cuisine. Dish by dish. The charred asparagus! My favorite. Mixed with pineapple aioli, fired jalapenos and chive oil, the flavor was on point! I thought they grilled the asparagus to make the perfect crunch and with the jalapenos providing just the right amount of spiciness balancing out the sweet pineapples, it rightfully deserves to be called New-American. Grilled avocado. Do you like cheese? Because the grilled avocado with tomatillo, chili and cotija cheese was simply amazing. A smooth avocado mixture in the center and crumby cotija cheese sprinkled on top made the perfect mix of textures in your mouth. Where to find cotija cheese?!The chicken-fried oysters with tzatziki sauce. At $3 each , each fried oyster was pricy, but presented so nicely on a bed of sea salt, I was afraid to touch it. But, it was yummy! On the day we went though, they didn't have any raw oysters, so I was sad for a moment.Now for their infamous pork sausage, and lychee salad! I would argue it's a bit hyped up. Seemed like an strange Asian fusion dish that had attempted to combine as many flavors as possible. I would have preferred the lychee salad and coconut foam with the red onions on its own. The pork sausage made it too heavy. BUT, do try it, as this was my friend's favorite dish. \u00a0Another Asian fusion dish was their uni scrambled eggs dish, which I liked the least. The eggs ruined or should I say consumed the flavor of the uni. Uni should be eaten alone or with a fresh vegetable. I couldn't appreciate the fusion nor did the uni hollandaise stand out. It was more of a mushy combination that cost me $17. Sorry.And another Asian fusion dish! Only this time, my Vietnamese friend said they should've named it French Pate and not a Vietnamese Pate. That says something. Regardless, I enjoyed the pate with it's creamy fat texture and strong meaty flavor. With the herbs added on top, I actually preferred just the spread without the garlic bread!We tried quite a few dishes, but I'd recommend going with more friends to try an even larger variety of dishes.

We received a few dishes \"on the house\" because we weren't seated until about 10:30 p.m. We ordered the chicken-fried oysters with raw oyster tzatziki, grilled avocado with tomatillo, poblano, and cotija cheese, the grilled pork blade steak with miso, cabbage and homemade sauerkraut, fresh fettuccini with pea shoots, tarragon and spring onions, and the uni scrambled eggs, crispy potatoes and uni holandaise.OH.

I'm mean let's face it, how many times have us transplants been fooled by talk of how good the food is in DC?? Too many times have I lowered my expectations, only to realize that lowering them still didn't compensate for bad food. So, suffice it to say, I didn't expect much from Rose's. I would have just been happy that the food was cooked properly, with the expectation of bland food. Well, unlike many restaurants I've been to in the area, Rose's has gotten it right:1. Quality food: everything tasted fresh, as if picked and slaughtered in the back yard. I wasn't surprised at this, many similar restaurants boast farm to table, seasonal ingredients. 2. Comfort food: HAVE MERCY ON ME!!! Yassssssss. Comfort me any day honey! Cornbread, ribs, catfish, chicken fried oysters (if you could see me right now, I'm raising my hand), yes please!! I love everything about food that makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. 3. Salt, in moderation, ain't never hurt no body: can I get an Amen to well seasoned food!! My goodness! What does it cost to season my food?? Apparently $$$, because Rose's can get pricey. Notable dishes: - Chicken fried oysters; don't think about it, just order a bunch!- Grilled pork blade steak. I didn't think it was gonna be good, but I am woman enough to admit I can be wrong sometimes. Order two!! - Pork sausage, habanero and lychee salad. There was a party in my mouth and my brain didn't get an invitation. I couldn't conceptualize it. I still may be in denial. Smh- Mezze Rigatoni \"sausage and peppers.\" Quite honestly, this was the best pasta dish I've had in so long, I can't remember what was my favorite before. Everything else pales in comparison. Minus 1 star for the dish that could have been so much better with less fatty portions (brisket). Minus 1 for me for allowing my partner in crime to order the Korean Catfish. I knew it wasn't gonna be good, but I was blinded by my endorphins after eating too much good food. Smh. What you can expect: (since I've used numbers and bullets, I guess I'll start with alphabets)A. Awesome service. We sat at the bar and had great service...at the bar. B. A long wait. Which, our wait wasn't too long since we opted to sit at the bar (45m opposed to 3.5 hrs waiting for a table).C. A relaxed atmosphere. Come in a suit after work, a spring time dress, or flip flops. I don't think you'll be judged...by anyone besides me. Jk jkD. Wear your stretchy pants. I wore a dress and heels, because I knew my pants wouldn't fit after I ate. E. \u00a0Horrible parking situation, but it could be worse. I got a ticket that has recently turned into $60.

The staff really worked with us to accommodate our reservation time since we were waiting on one person to arrive. The decor is very comfortable and homey, but not cheesey. The staff from hostesses to waiters and bartenders were super friendly and nice. We started with craft cocktails which were really yummy and interesting. The menu is small with four sets of small plates and two entrees. The staff strongly encourages you to eat family style which we did. For three of us, we ordered four small plates and one entree and we fully sated. The four small plates were: rock shrimp ceviche, spaghetti with spicy strawberry sauce, crispy softshell crab sandwich, and grilled avocado. The standouts were the pasta and avacado. The avocado was grilled and topped with tomatillo and cotija cheese. Amazing!!! So creamy and yummy!! The pasta was so whimsical but really delicious. The strawberry was present on the front end but not too sweet or cloying and then came a slow burning heat in the back of you mouth. The pasta was topped with fresh ricotta that tempered the spice. Really a very unusual but delicious dish. The ceviche was good, but I thought the shrimp pieces were a little too big and I also prefer a different kind of fish/seafood for ceviche in general. The crab sandwich was tasty, but not my favorite and a little more challenging to share. The entree was the pork shoulder with Mexican street corn (off the cob), guacamole, potato salad, and chipolte gravy. The corn and potato salad were outstanding!! The potato salad was almost a cross of potato salad and cold slaw with cabbage pieces in it--the potatoes were boiled in beer so they were not lacking in flavor. The pork shoulder was good, but a little on the dry side. Overall, this was a really fun dining experience and I would recommend it.

Also as you can tell from the photos, the plating is gorgeous and definitely part of the whole experience. A few tips:-I arrived at 4:30 on a pleasant Wednesday in mid-March and was 6th in line.-They apparently only have two tables that fit parties of six or greater. When we were let in at 5:30 we had the option of immediate seating but not everyone in my party was able to leave work that early, so we opted for the second seating. Since there are only two tables, the hostesses estimated our table would be ready between 8-9 PM, so we headed upstairs for some lovely drinks at the bar (and snuck in some oysters and lychee/habanero appeteasers).

We quickly ordered the entire menu...yup the entire menu. \u00a0Let me break it down:1) Grilled Avocado with Tomatillo, poblano and cheese: by far the best avocado I've ever had. Small - it is just one avocado, but it is pretty different. Interesting and glad I tried it but not worth getting again.2) Lychee Salad: OMF'ing-G the most amazing thing I've ever ordered anywhere. Everyone at the table, including carnivorous men, fell head over heels in love with this dish. Order this - it will blow your mind. It's so different from any dish I've ever had before. The pork sausage and habanero gives a lot of depth and substance to the salad.3) Grilled pork steak: eh...I'm not a pork person myself. \u00a0Everyone else seemed to like it more, but compared to the first two dishes this was a bit of a letdown. \u00a0It is just as it sounds..grilled pork.4) Fresh Fettuccini with pea shoots: This was very interesting, but I only needed a bite. The tarragon and the spring onions make this a very well flavored dish with lots of depth but just didn't sit right with me.5) Spaghetti with spicy strawberry sauce: Wow...so different from any other pasta dish I've ever had or imagined and it blew me away. This is a really inventive but also very delicious dish. Memories of this dish will stick with me for a long time. Yes, strawberry spaghetti sounds crazy but the spicy kick to it keeps it far from dessert territory.6) Korean Fried Catfish: I am not a catfish person and I just loved this dish. Loaded with flavor and so fresh - it didn't even taste fishy to me at all.7) Smoked Brisket: My group had actually just gone out for brisket for lunch, and this blew away the bbq restaurant by far.

Not mac and cheese, this is something else entirely, this place will take root in your nostalgic pleasure center throughout the entire course of the meal, and it is not until you leave that it hits you just how subtle and well-orchestrated everything was.It starts with the event of the queue. Go on a weekday night, if you do not want to wait outside for an hour and a half to get in the first seating before the door opens at 5, just arrive before 7 and put your name on the list. You will probably have to wait at least 2 hours using this method, but you can go have a drink down the block and receive a text when your table is ready. The night I went Jose Andres was also wandering around the block waiting for a table. Everyone (maybe short of the President) has to wait. Once you are in the door an intense calm will settle. There is no pressure to ever get up again if you don't want to. The restaurant is beautiful, it does not feel manufactured or hokey or trendy, it's pretty much just a nice house that happens to have a few bustling line cooks smack in the middle of it. The music is wack pop B sides (this will be my only complaint).Okay, you get your cocktail - I got a tasty agave, jalapeno something or other. It was great. All of the glasses are early 60's antiques that have prints straight out of a Richard Yates novel. This restaurant was named for the chef's grandmother so things a grandmother would own are a theme. The silverware is also notable, not so unlike my grandmother's silverware. Then we got some warm potato bread on a little floral plate. Now it seems obvious in retrospect, but it was not until about 5 hours later that I realized the bread was a play on a a baked potato, the whipped chive butter sprinkled with homemade bacon bits. So that was delicious and over the course of the meal we ate it all.We ordered some plates, trying to order a few at a time so the pace wouldn't be messed up. The server noticed what we were doing and said \"just give it to me all at once and I'll pace it out, what is this a barn?\" I embellish, but even at some of the nicest restaurants they cannot figure out how to bring things out in an appropriate manner.First out was a rock shrimp ceviche w/ crispy plantains. The interplay of the acidity with the sweet corn and plantains was perfect. These plantains were super small fried slivers, that honestly heavily resembled chow mein in texture and flavor. And I do have a soft spot for chow mein given my family's Fall River, Mass. routes (nostalgia center hit number one).Next it was the lychee/sausage/coconut milk salad, which is a huge hit, apparently. I liked it, but as someone that is very familiar with just how awesome coconut fat and red onions are I was not launched into another dimension like some patrons were by this one. Next we got the hanger steak with Japanese mustard, eel sauce, fried some kind of pepper (jalepenos?) and scallions. Mad tasty, especially that mustard. I feel like there was fresh wasabi in there, as well. The dish reminded me of great sushi flavors, but there was no fish or rice. Then the seafood dish - fried soft shell crab w/ bloody mary vinaigrette and sweet corn. Man, this dish. That was a nostalgia center hit as well. They were not being shy with the old bay on this one, and I think that \"vinaigrette\" was likely of the apple cider variety. (only figured this out later).Then we decided we had room yet, time to try a pasta dish for dessert - the Bucatini w/ sungold tomatoes and parmesan. The first thing you will notice about this dish is how sweet it is, but not just in a white sugar way. We ultimately decided after many guesses (licorice root?) that the off-beat sweetness was coming from agave, the same agave in my drink. It was not offensive at all, but worked nicely with the heavy acidity of the dish and mustiness of the cheese.Which brings me to why Rose's is not normal. The menu is so cohesive and thoughtful. There are a handful of crossover flavors to this summer menu - red onion, sweet corn, tomato, agave, cilantro, jalapeno. You do not even notice it is happening because the dishes are so diverse, but it puts you in a trance. And to finish, with the check, a grandmother favorite - homemade fig newtons. With a nice br\u00fbl\u00e9e crust on the top. I will be back the first day the menu changes.

Even the bartender was talking to the people for whom he was making a cocktail. I ordered a cava and the trout mousse to start. It came out fast, little bites of heaven: the mousse itself, little bits of apple, chervil and roe. I ate each one all together to let the flavors meld.In between the mousse and my second dish, my server sent me a \"gift\" of the famous pork sausage and lychee salad. This, kids, is the real deal. It could soon be as iconic as Rasika's palak chaat. It comes out separate, but a quick mix of the ingredients in the bowl yields a complex, unique blend of onions, coconut \"dressing,\" peanuts, herbs, lychees, sausage and habanero. It's a practice to send solo diners like myself a free dish. It's a great way to encourage more solo dining.After that I had the spaghetti with butter, lemon and duck egg. It looks deceptively simple when it arrives, but it has a very deep flavor and is incredibly rich. I also ordered the beef crudo, slices of meat with sea salt, mustard oil and cress. Another winner; the kick of the salt is what makes it.For dessert, I ordered the coconut ice cream. I don't even like coconut, really, but I loved this: chopped kiwi, coconut milk ice cream, sugar-burnt coconut flakes and coconut milk caramel. It was fantastic.

Everything was just superb - the food, the space, and the service especially. I think it is really special to find a place that is simultaneously so excellent and unpretentious, and for that reason I'm more than happy to add my voice to the chorus of five-star reviews here. Seriously, bravo.First of all, eating upstairs at the bar is just as good a way to enjoy the menu. We arrived on a Tuesday around 5pm to an already very long line, and when we got to the front we were informed by the (incredibly nice and articulate) hostesses that we might be able to get in for the second seating in 2+ hours. We had expected that and were fine with it, so we put our names in and headed upstairs to the bar to enjoy some drinks. The fancy Vieux Carr\u00e9s were excellent. At one point, one of the bar staff said we could even eat up there if we put our names in with them, and lo and behold, we were seated within only twenty minutes! Then came all of the delicious, delicious food, one stunning plate at a time. My bf and our friend and I split what felt like most of the small plate portion of the menu, with absolutely no regrets. The house-made bread and butter that goes to every table was totally divine (some people down the bar from us didn't eat all of theirs... I stared at it from time to time for the rest of the evening, secretly wishing I had an invisibility cloak to go steal it). The crab claws tasted fresh from the sea. The Vietnamese pate on garlic bread was so scrumptious and dense with flavor that I wanted to lick the dish it came in (alas, inappropriate). And the pork sausage with coconut and lychee totally blew my mind as I would have never put all of those flavors together. Everything was just amazing, but I was particularly impressed with the pastas. Strawberry spaghetti? What?!?! Yes. Eat it and weep. We put in an order for that and the fettuccini with pea shoots, and out came... both of those, and the whole wheat regenetti! Indeed, the awesome bearded bartender who was serving us was so thoughtful that he just straight-up comped us a plate of it, since it happened to be his favorite of the three pastas and we had only ordered the other two. It was the icing on the cake. (Seriously, somebody give that guy a nice bonus... or a plate of his favorite regenetti. The service he gave us was outstanding with the perfect level of attention.)Speaking of icing on the cake, dessert just continued to impress. I went for the corn creme brulee and was so glad I made that decision. I am not sure how they infused such a wonderfully strong, seasonal corn flavor into the cream but it really, really worked. Our friend got the eggplant tarte tatin, which in itself is just such an awesomely creative idea for a dish, and it tasted equally amazing.I'm running out of superlatives, so I'll just say that overall it was an incredible evening. We never felt rushed. The place just makes you feel so treated and comfortable.

You might not get to be seated first, but you will get one of the earliest reservations or get to sit at the bar. My friend and I got here at 6pm, and all the earliest we could have gotten a table was at 9pm! - Get a reservation for a table and at the bar. The bar has full service for food, but they don't do the cellphone reservations, you have to sign up, and they will come get you. This means you have to wait in the restaurant, but the wait is shorter. My party got a table at 8pm.-Also, don't just go up there and wait for people to get up from their seats. We saw several people take people's seats at the bar thinking they would be served. They waited all that time and didn't get to eat because they didn't pay attention and ask the bartender to take their names down!! -When waiting, go to the bar and get a drink. There is seating upstairs behind the bathrooms that people miss. The drinks are as special as the food. Enjoy them while you wait and chat with your party then. Once you get your food, don't bother talking just enjoy eating!The food:-The menu is very seasonal, so I won't comment on the individual dishes and talk about the quality. I had no problem with the quality of the dishes and the preparation. However, I think the dishes are meant to be unique culinary experiences. I had a spaghetti dish with a spicy strawberry and tomato sauce. I've never tasted anything like it before and thought it was great. However, I can understand that not everyone wants to try something that unusual. The bartender told me that it was a hit or miss dish with other customers. You should know that the dishes aren't meant to be crowd pleasers for everyone. It's really the place for people with an open mind when it comes to food.Overall, I would say I had a great experience.

I will warn you that the last 10 minutes of the wait is pure agony, but once you walk in the restaurant...ahhh, all is well with the world.The decor and ambiance are really something; Rose's is definitely one of the most photogenic restaurants I have ever been in, and they totally don't judge if you go in and geek out with your huge dslr (not that I did...). We're talking lights strung across the whole expanse of the ceiling, comfortably dim lighting + hip wooden furnishings that make the experience both casual and intimate, and an overall warmth that just can't be encompassed in words.If you can, I would highly recommending snagging seats at the kitchen bar! I mean seriously, it includes front row seating/prime paparazzi positioning of Aaron Silverman + a respectably diverse kitchen crew at werk.Challah bread + sesame/honey butter - man, their complimentary bread game is dang strong here.Popcorn soup with grilled lobster - Smooth, salty soup + chunky, not-so-salty lobster \u00a0+ miraculously not soggy popcorn = perfect balance of texture and flavor. Pork sausage, habanero, & lychee salad - The hype is real and the 15 different ingredients also very real. Pork is on the salty side, but no matter because your mouth is too busy juggling the flavor explosion to really notice anyways.Whole grilled quail - Possibly the best dish of the night. The moderately tender consistency of the meat + subtly sweet/tangy mulled cider glaze (SO. GOOD.) = winner.Capricci Amatriciana - I'm not a big pasta person, but w o w this housemade pasta was soft, was smoky with a kick of spice, was covered with shredded sheep milk cheese, was yummies.Desserts are also quite unique - the minty/milky English pea cake and the chocolate mousse w/coconut milk ice cream + shredded lime just continue to showcase the impeccable attention to detail and flavor juxtaposing at Rose's. Elizabeth was a fabulous server - pleasant, personable, and so, so accommodating!

You'll never have another meal like Rose's.I came to this place highly skeptical of all the praise thrown on Rose's. After being named the best new restaurant in America by Bon Appetit in 2014, you can't get within a mile of this place without arriving up to 90 minutes early (no reservations). Arriving at 4PM to stand in line with my group on a beautiful Tuesday afternoon, I was still seventh in line (one group of people were taking turns going to the Irish bar next door while they waited). At about an hour to opening there were 25-30 people. by 5PM, the line was at least 70 people deep. Keep in mind many people come to stand in line for their friends arriving later - you may be tenth in line only to have the amount of people in front of you double or triple as you get closer to opening. We were seated immediately in the front area of the restaurant. The place is decorated in a way that shows off the character of the old house it's in, while being very contemporary and chic. Our waiter Patrick, a tall skinny guy with a hipster beard/glasses combo, rolled up tight khakis and no socks expertly walked us through the menu. This wait staff knows their food inside and out, recommending that we order roughly 5-6 plates for a group of three. Despite the massive line of people right out the window, Rose's moves at a very casual pace. Patrick pleasantly talked with us, never rushing once. The food was brought out by a revolving doors of servers, who delivered each plate one at a time and described in great detail what was in it. Each. Time. I've never had service this good.So super hype, great service, hip interior - what about the food? To say the food was easily the best I've had in DC is a huge understatement: this may be some of the best, most flavor, and certainly most unique food I've ever experienced. First the drinks - I ordered the Gin, Wasabi, Green Tea, Lime, Ginger cocktail, which should taste disgusting but was actually very good - if you like wasabi you'll love this drink. Also the bread that came out - dear lord it was delicious, with a creamy butter too. Next was all of the food - the Pork and Lychee Salad ($13) was first, which we made vegetarian. It was a revelation - the taste changes three times in your mouth, from salty to sweet to spicy. The Grilled Avocado ($12) was topped with Cotja cheese with complemented the taste of the warm avocado perfectly. \u00a0The Chicken Fried Oysters ($3 each) are a must try - who would've thought tzaziki and dill would enhance the fried salty flavor of the oysters? The Grilled Pork Blade ($14) was cooked medium and melted in your mouth. The miso was a nice touch for a bit of salty flavor combined with the crispy and sour flavors of the cabbage and homemade saurkraut. Next out was the Charred Asparagus ($12) - one of my favorites of the night. The Pineapple Aioli in particular was to die for - sweet with a perfect balance of flavors (especially coupled with the spice of the jalapenos). Our last dish was the Martelli Spaghetti with spicy strawberry sauce ($13). I don't know how they did it, but it was both spicy and sweet, with noodles that were thick and tasted homemade. And oh the ricotta - perfect in every way. After receiving an erroneous dish, we were treated to a free *off the menu* pasta dish - noodles, butter, olive oil, topped with cheese, it was simple dish that was off the charts good (see the picture).For dessert, we ordered the English Pea Cake ($11) and the Eggplant Tarte Tatin ($10). Just when you think you couldn't be wowed any more, they make eggplant sweet and delicious on a pie crust and give you a bowl of mint curd, buttermilk, and pistachios, which shouldn't work but totally does. Of the two, the English Pea Cake is \u00a0the must try because I guarantee you've never had anything like it.If you're still reading and not running to stand in line for Rose's, you're a stronger person than I am.

But then I found myself in Eastern Market for a volunteer event on a Wednesday, and my fiance and I were hungry after. I had parked across from Rose's Luxury, so as we walked back to my car around 7:30, I noted it didn't look packed so we decided to stop in.They politely let us know there was a wait, but there would be a table available in about an hour. Perfect! Just enough time to grab a glass of wine somewhere (in hindsight...we should have gone to the upstairs bar but we underestimated the delicisousness of Rose's). A little less than an hour after we added our name to the list, we received a text that our table was ready. Yipee!Once we got there, the first thing I noticed was how calm the restaurant is. I'm sure they could \"turn the tables\" faster, meaning sitting all the tables at once and then re-seating them as soon as they were empty to cycle through more diners. But Rose's wants the experience to be great, so they don't do that and it was lovely to have such a calm, paced meal. I never felt rushed or like the server just wanted me to leave so the next table could sit.We tried a ton of different things on the menu. And I'd also note that my fiance has a nut allergy, and most restaurants just kind of glaze over that and don't say much, just ensure we don't order nuts. But here, the waitress took the menu to the chef and he carefully wrote out which items had nuts, which may have been cross contiminated by the kitchen set up, etc. It was incredible attention to detail that didn't go unnoticed.We tried the hamachi tacos, grilled avocado, pork and lychee salad (no peanuts), grilled asparagus, and grilled pork with miso. We also started with bread and butter. Literally everything I ate was amazing. If I'm being super picky, my least favorite was the hamachi tacos. I'm not a huge fish eater, and while these were not fishy, it just wasn't my favorite. The pork and lychee salad really *is* that amazing, so do yourself a favor and get it. The flavor combo is unique and delicious, I could eat that every day. We also had the eggplant tart and ice cream sampler for dessert. \u00a0The eggplant dessert was absolutely delicious, I was so surprised. Eggplant dessert? What? But it was caramelized, and sweet, and the pie crust was the best crust I've ever had (sorry Mom!). Lastly, the price...not so bad! For the excellent food execution and taste, outstanding service, and wonderful atmosphere, this was completely reasonable.

However, Rose's ran laps around the hype and more than exceeded expectations. We had a friend wait in line around 4:45 to get us reserved for second seating at 7:30. This was on a Wednesday so weekends might be more difficult. This gave us a chance to grab a drink at a nearby bar while we waited for a text from Rose's Luxury notifying us that we had 15 minutes to arrive in time for our reservation (followed by a personal phone call reminding us that we had 5 minutes). When we arrived the staff was extremely polite and gracious, thanking us for waiting in line and welcoming us to our table. They provided an overview of the menu. Each order came out as it was prepared and was accompanied with an explanation of what it was, how it was cooked, and a friendly joke or comment. From start to finish, the staff truly added to the experience. And now the food - come hungry...no wait, come starving! The four of us went for everything on the menu so that we could share and sample (this will come out to about $50-60 per person including tax and tip, not including cocktails). It is definitely worth doing this if you are able, as there were several items that we really enjoyed and may have missed out on had we not just ordered everything. Also, it really gives you a chance to take in the atmosphere, which is intimate and full of people enjoying their meals. Finally, we noticed several tables suffering from FOMO when some dishes came our way. Do not miss out! Go with friends and share everything!Everything was extremely well-flavored, tasted phenomenal, and left us all wanting more, until the next dish came and immediately caught our attention and appetites. If you go the entire menu route, you may be able to do without one of the pastas (although I cannot tell you which one, as they were all very good), or one of the family styles at the end (we had difficulty finishing the fish, although not out of lack of trying).

My friend had red wine.We shared the pickle-brined fried chicken, and the pork sausage lychee salad (many other reviews will tell you how that is), which I think were both over salted but still packed with flavor. Maybe it's because I've been cooking more lately and am more mindful of sodium intake. The boneless fried chicken had plenty of texture, the meat was tender and moist, and indeed delicious.

Rose's Luxury is, in fact, unspeakably good and you don't need me to tell you that. It's Bon Appetit magazine's #1 Best New Restaurant in America and also tops GQ's list of 25 Best Restaurants 2015. Both awards could not be more well-deserved - dining here last night was easily one of the best (if not THE best) dining experience of my entire life so far. The boyfriend and I did plenty of research before arriving, primarily strategizing what our queueing strategy would be. We decided to arrive at 3:30 PM on Saturday afternoon in an attempt to be seated in the \"first round\" when Rose's opened at 5 PM. I was not surprised to discover that the line was already 40 people deep by the time we claimed our spots. Fortunately, the time passed quickly and I grabbed some tea from a cute shop down the street. About 20 minutes before 5, one of the employees came out and gave time estimates to each of the parties in line... we ended up being just near the cutoff to be included in the first round. Success!Once inside Rose's, I instantly fell in love with the decor. Romantic dangling strands of lights in the back room, vintage glasses, dishes, and silverware, candlelight, natural light... everything was gorgeous and reminded me of a less commercialized Anthropologie. Another stroke of luck/fate - my boyfriend and I managed to nab the last two seats at the Chef's Counter, where we were able to watch the open kitchen. I would arrive earlier next time JUST to reclaim these seats, as it was truly mesmerizing to watch the chefs work like a well-oiled machine. We were recommended to order 4 small plates and an entree (family style) or 5-6 small plates without an entree (which the parties next to us did). This ended up being the perfect amount of food, leaving just enough room for dessert. I don't think that I am talented to adequately describe the food... so I'll just list what I ordered. But I would be willing to bet that ANYTHING you get here will be delicious, because I was blown away.- Chicken fried oysters- Grilled avocado with cotija cheese (our server was kind enough to order this for us on the house - each dining party receives one free small plate!)- Pork sausage, habanero, and lychee salad (must have)- Whole wheat reginetti pasta with kale- Maple glazed carrots- Korean fried catfish- Coconut milk ice cream & burnt coconut & kiwi (dessert)- Ice cream tasting (cinnamon toast crunch.... oh yes, coffee, and avocado - we subbed out the banana) Rose's manages to wow you with just a few bites, but nothing here feels like it's \"too much\" or \"trying too hard\". On top of the sublime cuisine, the service is impeccable. All of the servers are so friendly and attentive. Rose's made me realize that, sometimes, we walk away from dinner feeling only temporarily satisfied by a full stomach. My boyfriend and I left that night feeling truly happier from the entire experience. On an unrelated side note - they provide bobby pins in the restroom. And rosemary mint soap. Seriously, no detail is overlooked here. Just by watching the kitchen for a couple hours, I could sense how happy each chef was and their passion truly translates within the dishes they prepared.

Then we received the signature pork sausage, habanero, peanuts & lychee salad. \u00a0This was just as wonderful as everyone describes. \u00a0There was a coconut foam in the salad that added a nice touch to the flavor. \u00a0I'm already a big fan of pork sausage and lychee so I already knew I was going to enjoy this dish.We also ordered the grilled hangar steak, japanese mustard, eel sauce & scallions plate. \u00a0Out of all the small plates we had that night this was actually my favorite. \u00a0The hangar steak seemed to be cooked medium rare which is what I prefer. \u00a0The eel sauce added an incredible light bbq sauce type flavor over the steak and the scallions blended perfectly with everything.Our server threw in a complimentary order of the spaghetti with spicy strawberry sauce & this afternoon's ricotta. \u00a0This was really tasty and fortunately not spicy at all. \u00a0If you're trying to narrow down your small plate choices I would include this plate only after the avocado, lychee salad, and hanger steak.For our family style dish we went with the braised pork shoulder, peach bbq & summer sides. \u00a0I think they said the pork had been cooked around 36 hours. \u00a0It melted right in your mouth. \u00a0The peach bbq sauce had a small amount of habanero spice. \u00a0This sauce gave the pork this incredible bbq buffalo wing type flavor.For dessert we tried the ice cream taster which was a definite recommend. \u00a0The flavors included avocado and white chocolate, coffee flavor with dark chocolate, and cinnamon toast crunch. \u00a0We also tried the corned cr\u00e8me brulee. \u00a0It was really good but I preferred the different ice cream flavors since they were so unique.The bill came out to about $45 a person including drinks and tip. \u00a0This was astonishing to us considering the amount of food we received and the quality. \u00a0My friend that I was with said it's the best meal he's ever had for the value and I have to say I agree with him.", "name": "\nJason H.\n", "location": "\nFairfax, VA\n"}, {"rating": "5.0", "review": "I am notoriously known by my friends and my ever-so-patient boyfriend, for being hard to impress at restaurants. \u00a0It's not that I hate things, I actually like everything. \u00a0But that's just it...I \"like\" a lot of things. \u00a0The BF and my foodie BFFs are always trying to catch when I am blown away.

Our waitress, Kersten (I think I am spelling her name right), was ahh-mazing. \u00a0We asked her for recommendations and she knew her stuff. \u00a0She did not even blink to name us her top choices - and we were not disappointed. \u00a0She told us they have a few menu choices that have substantial staying power, but they tend to change up 1 or 2 items every month. \u00a0Here's a quick run down of our meal. Chicken fried oysters with dill sauce - So good. \u00a0What brought it home for us was the dill sauce and a green oil on top of the oyster. \u00a0Amazing. Smoked trout mousse - a light trout mousse with apple and trout roe. \u00a0Whoa. \u00a0It was totally not what I expected, but it was so delicious. \u00a0The mouse was atop these light crackers and the trout roe was perfectly salty. Pork sausage salad with lychee - Shut the front door. This menu item has been on the menu since Rose's opened and for good reason. It comes in a bowl with the pork sausage, red onion, peanuts, lychee. Ugh. Just get it. You mix it all together and eat it with a spoon. \u00a0This salad alone is worth waiting in like for. \u00a0i would wait hours for this salad. \u00a0It's that good. Ricotta stuffed gnocchi with crispy sunchockes and mushroom butter - these were super yummy. \u00a0Can you see the pattern yet? However, if I could live without one of these dishes, it would be this one, just because all the other dishes blew this one out of the water. Smoked brisket, white bread, slaw, and horseradish - This is one of their family style dishes and it definitely stuffed me and the BF. The brisket was so tender and melted in my mouth like buttah. \u00a0I didn't even need a knife, it just broke apart with my fork. The BF made the really insightful comment that he really appreciated the great juxtaposition of the dish (whoa - big word). \u00a0The brisket had no sauce, just great meat. \u00a0The platter came with toasted white bread, like what your momma used to pack in your lunch, classic horseradish (which could have had a bigger kick), and the most delicious slaw I have ever had. \u00a0Charleston ice cream - the item isn't on the menu, but Kersten gave us some to go along with our brisket. \u00a0It was rice with butter, gold flakes, and just melty goodness. Eggplant tarte - For dessert, I was skeptical about the eggplant tarte, but when Kersten said it was like apple pie comforty, I just decided to go with it because she hadn't steered us wrong all night. \u00a0The eggplant was cooked down to exactly what the perfect apple pie is supposed to be like and the vanilla ice cream atop it was extremely flavorful. \u00a0As a birthday treat, I got the \"special\" ice cream which was avocado and white chocolate. \u00a0You can't make this stuff up. \u00a0The BF goes, \"Of course, you want to hate it, but it's just so good,\" \u00a0That's exactly what Rose's is summed up to be in my mind. \u00a0The dishes don't appear to make sense, but once you try it, all rationale goes out the door. \u00a0Oh and the Stumptown cold brew coffee Vietnamese-style. \u00a0Perfection.

Can you taste the onion ash on top of the shallot butter? Or how about the coconut foam in the lycee and sausage (vegetarians, they have vegan sausage, fyi)? Their menu is so wonderfully playful that you'll have a blast tasting each bite thoughtfully.If you are looking for Cheesecake Factory sized portions, this place is going to fail you miserably. The philosophy here (which I agree with) is \"less is more.\" I'd rather have 3 bites of something incredible (like their bucatini with sungold tomato sauce!) than a trough of something mushy and ill-seasoned.Service during both of my visits was excellent.

So the restaurant opened at 5:30 and the line started moving fairly quickly, but when I got up to the host at around 6:00, I was told that it would be an 1.5-2.0 hour wait. Fantastic... I was like... I've invested enough time thusfar... so yeah... \"I'll wait.\" 2 hardest words I've had to say in my life. \u00a0Other than \"I'll pay.\"  Go a couple of glass doors down to Lola and have a couple of glasses of champ. About an hour and half later they text me with a message, paraphrased: \"you have 15 minutes to get back here or your reservation will be given up\".We get in and they serve us the most magical little loaf of challah bread. \u00a0It looks like it would fit perfectly in an easy bake oven. It is cooked perfectly, warm, strand-y inside; soft, a good amount of egg, and coated with black sesame. \u00a0It is ingeniously served with a ramekin. Yep just an empty ramekin for looking at. No... it is served with a ramekin with about 2 tablespoons of butter that is situated in a miniature pool of honey. The butter is topped with more black sesame and Kosher?Sea?Flat-cleaved salt. Money does not buy happiness. Cause happiness is this mini loaf of challah, and they serve this on the house. Next we try a half ounce of trout caviar. Served with miniature thin potato chips and creme fresh- this app is just ok. To me and my companion, it holds as a comparable fishy french onion dip substitute. Then we get to the Arc De Triomphe of food experiences: The pork and litchi (lychee) salad. \u00a0My companion states that she is not sharing hers. We are both getting our own.. and after I take one bite, I understand why. Coming to the table, you are confronted with a small bowl topped with lychee and red onion. \u00a0The waitress instructs you to stir. As you stir, you realize the orchestrated underbelly of this dish which includes but is not limited too: fried garlic, coconut powder, whipped coconut milk, pork sausage, garlic oil, peanuts, cilantro, and \u00a0the entire Mormon Tabernacle Choir!!! The depth, flavors, and roundness of the dish are impressive. It is gone in a minute flat. Then we decided to get the shellfish stew to share. Which I feel was the biggest miss of the night. Shellfish sit in a very marinara-y sauce. \u00a0Bright orange in color and shallow in depth. The fennel salad is good but too sparse. \u00a0Missing seasoning, and I don't understand the garlic bread served with it. We surely should have gotten the brisket, toast, and pickeled onions.

Rose's was named 2014's Best New Restaurant in America by Bon Appetit. Chef/owner Aaron Silverman prioritizes the diner and goes above and beyond to make the customer happy. Rose's does not take reservations, which means diners have to wait in long lines before the place opens at 5:30. We had a friend wait in line for us. He got there at 4, and was seventh in line. By the time I met up with him just before opening, he was further back in the line because those in front of him were also holding a spot for their parties. Lucky for our group of three, we all arrived on time and were seated immediately at the front of the restaurant. Fresh flowers around the place and candles on the tables and beautiful pillows on the bench. The atmosphere is extremely casual and inviting. Our waiter, Patrick, approached our table and put us at ease, telling us to take our time to look over the drink menu, and then saying that he'd be back to talk food. Throughout our entire meal, Patrick was attentive, thoughtful, and patient. In fact, all of the servers were just as great as Patrick. I ordered a cocktail of tequila, ginger, jalapeno, agave and grapefruit ($12). It was very good, and it complimented all the food very well, which was a happy coincidence. We were given a loaf of Japanese bread with whipped honey butter. I could eat that all day. Patrick told us that, for a group of 3, we could easily eat about 5 or 6 small plates and one family-style meal. We stuck with all small plates. The first thing that came out was the pork sausage, lychee and habanero salad, which we made vegetarian (the pork sausage being soy \"sausage\"). The salad also had coconut foam, sliced red onions, cilantro and peanuts. The server that brought this dish to our table told us to mix everything together so that we get a bit of each ingredient in every bite. This salad was quite possibly the best thing I have ever eaten. EVER. When mixed, the foam melts and creates a dressing over everything. The salad went from sweet and salty, to spicy, in three different stages. The peanuts and onions provide a much-needed crunch to the otherwise chewy ingredients. Every dish was as thoughtfully prepared as that salad. The other two in my group raved about the grilled pork blade. The grilled avocado, topped with tomatillo, onions and cotija cheese, was warm, salty, and crunchy, all at once. The avocado was melted in the center, and with the onions, was a great contrast of textures. The charred asparagus dish was a revelation. Grilled asparagus with pineapple chunks, fried and fresh jalapeno slices, pineapple aioli and chive oil, it was a perfect balance of smokey, sweet and spicy. The spaghetti with a spicy strawberry sauce and ricotta was our last small plate -- the sauce highlighted seasonal strawberries in a sauce that was a beautiful combination of flavors. The smooth ricotta melted in and paired amazingly with the slightly sweet, slightly spicy strawberry and tomato sauce. During our meal, we were accidentally given an extra plate of the asparagus dish, and when we notified Patrick of the error, he took the plate back and said he'd see what he could do. We received a complimentary, off-the-menu, cacio e pepe, a classic Italian dish of spaghetti, butter, cheese and black pepper. Absolutely scrumptious!We ordered two dishes for dessert. The first was an eggplant tarte tatin. The eggplant in this dessert was roasted and then glazed with caramel, then topped with a vanilla and olive oil ice cream, which was again topped with caramel. It was delicious and very sweet. The second was an English pea cake, my favorite dessert of the two. The dessert was pieces of a light English cake (made with pureed peas), served in a mint and buttermilk curd, garnished with candied pistachios and pea shoots. It was earthy, minty and not overly sweet -- a perfect way to end the most perfect of meals. Our dishes were brought to our table by a different server, who then described the dish in detail, including what it consisted of and how to eat it. Not a single person rushed us; we were told to take our time and enjoy our meal. Enjoy we did! Price-wise, no small plate is over $15, which was a nice surprise for a restaurant such as Rose's. The entire evening was a joy. Rose's is fine dining food in a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere, where you can wile away the hours with good food. I read Silverman's Bon Appetit interview after visiting Rose's -- it is worth a read for anyone that wants to try Rose's, and it gave me a new-found appreciation for the place.

Chicken Fried Oysters w/Raw Oyster Tzatziki - 3.5*- Either the oysters are really small, or cut in half. There is a delicious chive oil drizzled under the oysters that made the dish. They're really small, so 2 per person.2. Smoked Trout Mousse - 4.5*- We really enjoyed the delicate complexity of this dish. The mousse was light and freshly fishy. A few pieces of caviar on top for the luxury pop. Served on a shrimp chip. One of our favs.3. Sliced Beef Crudo - 3.5*- Basically beef carpaccio. Enjoyed the mustard oil and sea salt, but not too inventive in my book.4. Whole grilled quail - 3*- Probably my least favorite dish. It was burned. When you have such a tiny bird with such little meat, I truly believe you can't afford to burn it.5. Pork sausage, habanero, lychee salad - 4.5*- It lives up to the hype. So many flavors! Sweet, spicy. Hints of caraway seed and coconut milk.6. Mezze Rigatoni Amatriciana - 5*- This dish was the absolute highlight of our evening. The pasta was cooked perfectly. The light tomato based sauce is made with pork Jowl and has a an incredible refined smoky flavor. GET THIS DISH. Better, get two of this dish. Order a whole bucket. The bartender said this was his favorite as well, even trumps the lychee salad for him. This is probably the best pasta dish I've ever had.7. Duck egg spaghetti - 4*- Very rich. Enjoyed the duck egg flavor. Honestly could've used a little salt.8. Hakurei turnips - 4*- Very strong asian flavors in this dish bursting with umame. Served in a fish broth with tofu cubes. Pretty sure it was white miso in there. It was my husbands least favorite dish and probably the only one I'd say was really overpriced for what you got. It is brand new on their menu.9. Hot Chicken - 4*- Pretty darn spicy. And we love spicy food. Also a nice big portion, could be used as your main protein. Dish felt southern to me.All in all, I found the food at Rose's Luxury to be very good, basically a luxurious version of down home cooking, ironically enough.These 9 dishes filled us up so much that we wimped out on dessert. The bartender was nice enough to have delicious ice cream sent over anyway, but we could barely finish it. I'm disappointed that we didn't get to the fois gras french toast but...next time??Okay, which brings me to the wrap up here....was it really worth that line and will we be back. Honestly? Yes the food was DELICIOUS and I'm glad we tried it - but it was not the best meal I've ever had, not even the best meal I've had in Washington. I think this is the kind of experience I'd recommend one time.

All were pleasant and not at all pompous (after all Rose's Luxury is rated the #1 restaurant in the country). They gave us a few options for seating, we ended up snagging the kitchen bar seats so that we could watch the chefs prepare the food. Now on to the food. Their complimentary Japanese bread with the toasted sesame seed and honey.....a mouth orgasm yall. I mean. The free bread was amazeballs. Fresh and warm and sweet and fluffy all at the same time. I'm not big on bread but damnit I could eat their bread all day long. Some of my favorite things that we ordered:1- Lychee pork salad : spicy, sweet, savory all at once in your mouth. I loved it!!!! Definitely not for everyone (my bf didn't like it, thought it was too spicy) but I loved it so much! 2- Grilled pork blade steak: get it get it get it. I can not express how much I think you should get it. 3. Rigatoni with sausage: omg. You could taste the freshness with every bite. It was so simple and beautifully prepared. Get it get it get it you guys! 4. Ice cream tasting platter: they had banana, coffee and cinnamon. Best ice cream I've tasted. Overall- this place definitely is worth the hype. There is a simplicity to Rose's that you just don't seem to get with other famous restaurants. The ingredients in every dish was fresh which really added flavors to the dishes.

So we put our name down for both options and waited. \u00a0And waited. \u00a0And waited... \u00a0Two and a half hours later, we finally got two bar stools (where my feet hung a foot from the floor for the whole meal). \u00a0Ridiculous.Anyways, the food WAS good (but not 2.5 hour wait good). \u00a0While we chose our dishes, they delivered some pretzel bread, which was warm, fluffy and topped with sea salt for good measure. \u00a0It came with a pad of butter sunk into a few tablespoons of honey - kinda odd, but a unique touch. The first dish to arrive was the Mezze Rigatoni w/ Parmesan Cream & Truffled Breadcrumbs - this was one of the highlights of the meal with a rich, creamy sauce. \u00a0The breadcrumbs were a nice touch of crunchy texture that we both really liked. \u00a0The Honey-Glazed Carrots, Mascarpone, Matzo Meal & Dill came next - they were cooked perfectly and the sauce was an interesting combo of bursting flavors.Then, a surprise from our bartender arrived - a free dish - namely the Pork Sausage, Habanero & Lychee Salad, which ended up being my favorite dish of the night! \u00a0Following the waiter's recommendation to mix it, the sauce perfectly complimented the strange, yet suited combination of ingredients. The lychee was particularly odd and the pork succulent and delicious -- and together it simply just WORKED. \u00a0I wasn't a big fan of the Classic Cacio E Pepe - it tasted like it contained the same pork from our salad dish, and I wasn't especially fond of the flavor overall. \u00a0My date seemed to enjoy it though. \u00a0By this point, we were both getting full and had completely forgotten about our last dish -- the \"Hot Chicken\". \u00a0Like the other before it, it was a completely unique dish -- chicken on a slide of bread with some sort of sauce and onions. \u00a0I was a big fan of it, but will warn you that when it says hot, it truly means SPICYYYY - so probably save it for last because it will completely blow your palate with intensity and you won't be able to enjoy the complex flavors of the other dishes.In sum, the food was superb but I'm simply not sure why it's THIS popular.

Sausage, habanero, lychee salad. Every, single pasta on the menu. These were a few of my favorite things. To describe them in detail would be pointless, because with 488 other reviews, I'm sure you can find a detailed description if you need it. But for what it's worth, that is how I'm casting my vote when it comes to the food itself (and we tried almost everything on the menu). Here's why: The popcorn soup and sausage/lychee salad top the list for originality. As for the pastas, they are all winners in a completely different way--they are perfectly executed versions of comforting, classics.I always go to restaurants for the food, but warm service and a good vibe never hurts. And in addition to the fantastic food, Rose's has both in spades. Everyone we talked to seemed absolutely stoked to be working there, happy to be serving us, and genuinely excited to offer recommendations. But the service was not intrusive or suffocating. The whole restaurant felt relaxed, friendly, and shockingly low-key (in a good way) for a place that has a line out the door before they even open every night.Now I'm not going to lie, the whole experience was not hurt by the fact that my dear, dear friend waited in the line for over an hour (in the drizzly rain) to put our name in. I just rolled up to a nearby bar after she did the hard work to drink cocktails and wait with her for the table. It was my birthday, so it was a very kind gesture on her part. That being said, I'm willing to wait in that line (although maybe not in the rain) for another chance to eat at Rose's. And I freaking hate lines. (See: I've never had a Georgetown Cupcake.)Some friends and I have a running joke, whereby when we say something is good, we might emphasize it by saying \"definitely top five X\" (top five bites, top five burgers, top five divebargrilledcheesesandwiches etc.). Ostensibly we're mocking the obnoxious popular habit of listing favorites, even though inwardly we clearly find ourselves struggling against the irresistible impulse to do the same thing.

The sweetness from the lychee and the saltiness from the sauage was a really delicious combo. The grilled asparagus \u00a0- while cooked perfectly, was still not a wow factor. Even the smoked brisket (Family style) was on the drier side with a ton of fat (which as an asian and used to this type of meat, i love, but i can see how non asians might not love this) although the slaw that came with it was refreshing and tasty. Of course, being the fatties that we were, we ordered both the pea cake and the coconut dessert - both were very delicious and s i think if the pea cake didn't have all of the extra leaves in the dessert, I would've probably loved it even more.

I don't know where to begin because each bite made me thank Jesus for the experience. First we had caviar with homemade potato chips.

Both have very generous portions (not enough bread, but they're happy to bring you more for free) and are some of the best versions of the dip/spread I've had. They're both drizzled with a bit of olive oil and coarse salt and pepper, which really accent the flavor.

I think I like a ragu-style sauce more than having chunks of pork-- the lemon was an interesting touch though, that brightened the whole plate. Don't overlook the salads! The baby lettuce salad was lightly dressed (yay!) and even had blue cheese, which I normally don't like, but since it was used in such moderation and balanced well with the rest of the ingredients (apples, spiced walnuts, raspberry vinaigrette) it worked for me.

There is also a fun downstairs room for a little bit more lively experience in case you have a group and want to be a bit louder.We about 6 dishes and very pleased with each one.

Slow down. Save some for the second date. I know first impressions are important, but you didn't have to try to sweep me off my feet so soon. I do have to admit, though, I'm already looking forward to our next little rendezvous. Just, you know, play it cool, don't tell Sonoma or Floriana, I don't want them thinking we're already an item. Yet.So yeah, safe to say, this place absolutely wowed me on my first visit. The tiny and cute blue exterior makes it look like it could be a shop selling flowers or arts and crafts, definitely outpacing the rest of the neighborhood a bit. The interior is small but open and airy and light, the decor is spartan but inviting, right out of some modern design magazine. The service is friendly and attentive, and the overall feeling of the place is that you're just visiting some friends who are great hosts with a particularly nice and upscale dining nook in their kitchen. Our server was super helpful with recommendations, especially helpful with gauging the size of dishes and how many we'd need, and when I asked her to bring me a red wine that would pair well with our selections, whatever mystery red she brought nailed it.The food perfectly mirrored the simple yet elegant ambiance, with dishes that didn't overwhelm the palate but still provided a sensual joy in each bite. Seriously, when you order chickpea puree, you think you're just getting hummus, yeah? Whatever came on that plate was smooth and creamy enough to make the executives at Sabra commit seppuku with shame. Pappardelle with pork sauce and parmesan always floats my boat, but some genius in Nido's kitchen decided to add some lemon and give the dish a delightful lightness. In all, my party of four ordered maybe seven or eight dishes, and upon walking out we all agreed that there wasn't a weak offering among them.My first meal at Nido was like one of those early exciting kisses with your new girlfriend, you come up for air and already can't wait for the next one.

The menu is a celebration - causing you to pause and enjoy your time - luckily there is not yet a line outside the door hugging the block. The first dish comes out, full of smoky flavor, textures, surprise elements, a few sweet undertones. Second - gosh, the garnish, the sauce drops, al dente pasta, crispy mushrooms - all makes such an amazing balance. Third... you got the idea. And the portions are not shy - for the price of a small appetizer plate elsewhere in the district. After all you decide to go for dessert - yet another perfect, moist, bold piece.

Food came out rather quickly as it was prepared and everything was delicious. My personal favorites were the House Made Ricotta and Shishito Peppers. Least favorite being the Stuffed Grape Leaves because I wasn't the biggest fan of the chicken liver.Next we ordered small plates to share. Again, everything came out as it was prepared and everything was delicious. The dishes we tried included the Hierloom Tomato, Tomatillo & Corn Salad, Braised Pork Shoulder, Grilled Octopus and Papardelle. The salad was perfectly dressed, incredibly flavorful and fresh. The pork shoulder had an amazing sauce and was filling paired with the patatas bravas. The octopus was not chewy at all and was just even better with the chorizo and beans and the papardelle was true homemade pasta with love!Between the four of us we all ate well, enjoyed what we had and were able to have a wonderful dinner due to a pleasant atmosphere.

For something very warming, also try the lobster with saffron citrus broth with cuttlefish and noodles, it's the perfect kind of seafood dish that you crave. \u00a0These dishes alone literally make you want to keep coming back over and over and if I become broke, I'd be glad to say it was all because I've stuffed my face with the fried chicken and biscuits at Barrel.A mere blocks away from Capitol Hill and congress, the rich bourbon-colored interiors with accents of exposed brick \u00a0and walnut wood make Barrel are a good-mood-setter especially during the winter or any other rainy day not only for local people on the Hill but also for out-of-towners to discover. \u00a0However, the summer months also offer a panoply of brilliant and ice-cold cocktails so always keep this winner of a restaurant in mind at all seasons and at all times.", "name": "\nAhmed K.\n", "location": "\nWashington, DC\n"}, {"rating": "4.0", "review": "Haven't been out in this area much and decided to double date at Barrel.

His drink had hot water, port, and an orange slice with cloves in it. It for sure did do the trick in clearing me up for a little bit. My friends would tell you otherwise, but I noticed the difference. We had the opportunity to try a different variety of items. Everyone ordered their own dinner, but Barrel so nicely provided us a couple of free appetizers -- specifically -- brussel sprouts and their take on hot wings. I hate brussel sprouts. WITH. A. PASSION! I have to admit though this was probably my favorite we tried. Other items I liked was the Carolina sticky buns, and my ham and biscuits. Their biscuits in itself are something to write home about. As far as the ham -- it is a healthy portion of prosciutto served with a side of jammy like butter. I ordered the ham and biscuits from their $5 happy hour menu.As far as the their hot wings - are made with a Thai chili spice that really gives you a good kick in the mouth with how spicy they are. Spice lovers will appreciate this dish. It isn't your run of the mill buffalo sauce.... it is not buffalo sauce at all to be exact.The happy hour is kickin'. $5-6 apps and $5 drinks. You can't really beat that in my book. Happy hour sizes are small, but that is to be expected with happy hour. Next time I will just opt for a full meal.

She was pleasant, and well rounded making sure we had what we needed when we needed it.Upstairs is more sporty with televisions, bar seating, and table seating and a bit louder than the dimly lit downstairs. Downstairs is definitely like being the cellar. I am not a huge fan of being in any basement or dimly lit cellar, but for this particular place -- like my less desired taste for brussel sprouts -- this is easily the exception where I was okay being in a cellar. I really appreciated Mike the GM, and Ruairi stopping by to see if we were enjoying ourselves and hearing our feedback.

Appropriately named when you think about Whiskey Barrels which you will find throughout the lower level. Attending Yelp events are a great way to try out places that you have never thought about visiting or even yet, never knew existed. Barrel is a BAR that just so happens to serve a limited Southern Cuisine menu for those who need a little something in their belly when they're getting their drink on! This place is interesting. It's dark, with ample dining tables upstairs and a rather large bar. The bar area does have flat screen TV's for the sports enthusiasts! Downstairs is somewhat spooky and cellar like. I take that back, it is a freakin cellar, with tables and a bar. Very low ceilings and you need the light from your cellphone to see the menu. That being said, it's pretty cool. Nothing I'd want to experience all the time but definitely every now and then. Now to the food. Again, this is a bar that happens to serve food, thus the menu is EXTREMELY limited. What we did have was quite tasty. We were here during happy hour, so the price was right!!! \u00a0I had the Confit Chicken served with toasted french bread. Unique and again, very tasty! It was similar to a very spicy chicken cole slaw salad. The Carolina BBQ pork sticky buns were bite sized little sandwiches that everyone at our table thoroughly enjoyed. Toya J. had the fried chicken dish. It looked amazing but she said the taste did not live up to the looks. Man, I hate when that happens!! She couldn't put her finger on it but it was missing a little something.Management realized that we were esteemed Yelpers and provided a very large bowl of complimentary Brussel Sprouts and a tray of Thai chili wings. I've never been a huge fan of Brussel Sprouts so it took a lot of coaxing from Tracy N. before I finally gave in. WOW, these things were outstanding. Hands down, my favorite dish here. Like she said, they could have been a meal all their own. The wings were good, not very good but good. Nothing to write home about. Service was excellent and just reminiscing about the evening and what Barrel is, I bumped up my initial rating from a 3 to a 4 Star.

Barrel is exceptional. It has the best bar food I've ever had in my life, and that same \"bar food\" (it feels like a disservice to call it bar food) is better than many, many other restaurants offerings that I've had over the years. We started with a couple Bucket cocktails. Great drinks. Used some really good bourbon to make a drink that reminded me of a sweeter Manhattan. Served with a baseball sized circular ice cube!First up were the pork sticky buns which were just as good as all the other reviews on Yelp have said. The sticky bun bread is warm and chewy and sweet. If they served that bread alone with some butter and honey they could honestly sell it as dessert. The slaw and BBQ are both tangy and delicious, but the sticky buns stole the show for me. The fried chicken is something I haven't seen discussed much in reviews here, and that really surprises me. This is some of the best fried chicken I have had anywhere. Served immediately out of the fryer and on to the plate, it was literally dripping with flavor. Juicy, succulent, and hot as hell, this is what KFC and all other chicken places should aim to have their chicken taste like. I wish I could describe it better. But you really just have to try it. It is fried chicken on steroids.That awesome fried chicken also came with a biscuit topped with some apple jam that also could also be served by itself as a dessert or app. Biting into that biscuit was buttery heaven. The sweet jam complemented the heat of the chicken perfectly. We ended with a couple bourbons. The bourbon list here (as others have noted) is extensive. If you like bourbon or are just at all interested in trying some for the first time, this is a great place to do it. The bartenders we interacted with and ordered from were all friendly and helpful and were more than willing to recommend drinks for us, all while working a busy Friday night. I had the Pritchard Chocolate which had wonderful cocoa notes in the nose and finish. Great winter drink! Finally, some good and bad.Great:-Exceptional food. The fact that it's basically bar food makes it even more special. The food here rivals many end high end restaurants in the area. -One of the most extensive bourbon lists I've ever seen. If you like bourbon, they have something for you here. -Outstanding service.

Definitely would recommend to you!Also, their pancakes are delicious! First of all, it is so beautifully plated. It had a big pile of sweet whip cream filling up almost half of the plate. The whip cream was infused with ginger and on top of the pancakes there was delicious sugared apples. The steak and eggs was good. There was a cheese sauce that came with it. I asked that they put the cheese sauce separately, but they forgot and put the sauce on my plate. I was drinking the night before, so the sauce seemed really gross to me.

I thought the flavors in this dish was the most tame out of the other dishes that we tried. Nonetheless, everything worked really well together to satiate an appetite while offering a memorable dish. - The fried chicken over a biscuit and orange jam (sans gravy): the fried chicken was boneless, juicy and crispy. The buttery biscuit went great with the sweet, candied orange jam (or I think it was orange - it might have been tomatoes because it was too dark to make out what it was...) - The bartender was very engaging and friendly. We also got lucky with a stray mac n cheese dish that the restaurant gave to us on the house. The mac n cheese was just what the dish should be - creamy and cheesy for a cold, cold night. The questionable:- The brussel sprouts with fish sauce was WAY too salty. I think it had 2 or 3 more splashes of fish sauce than was necessary - the salt level was so severe that the insides of my mouth felt dehydrated as I was eating the brussel sprouts! The same goes for the gravy served under the fried chicken. - The dim lighting was a level beyond mood lighting as I could not see my food... my friend and I played a guessing game as to the color of some of our dishes (green, brown, yellow?).

Excellent companion to the aforementioned fried chicken.

When it arrived it looked well for about the first taste (then I notice all this egg white power floating around - GROSS is all I can say).I needed to cleanse my palette of this gross drink, and the God's were shining down on me this night as Barrel was open and a young man by the of Chris was at the bar! He asked how he could help me and I told him I had just had this gross drink (& I paid for it) and could he please make me something, anything that would take this taste out of my mouth. OMG!!!! He said he was going to make me a Huckleberry Pisco sour with La Dialada(sp) Pisco in it! I was like OK but if I don't like it you are buying it and he said fine and let me say this when a bartender says that I know that I am going to get a cocktail that is going to hit on all the notes I am looking for. Chris proved to me in one drink that he knew what he was doing and all I wanted was more. 1st he used real egg whites like you are supposed to in a Pisco Sour (sans the flavor only use real egg whites) Second of all it was pretty and I am a girl after all. Lastly, he left me wanting to try more of his cocktails, when you are lucky enough to find a bartender like Chris Martino in this town who is so knowledgeable and cares about the cocktails he puts in front of you that is a feat in itself.

We found a spot easily which was great. The decor is very modern and beautiful, with the walls and tables made out of wood. Had a \"speakeasy\" feel. Absolutely loved the atmosphere. However, the drinks weren't very good. I ordered two drinks and both tasted like medicine. I would have not said anything about this, but everyone else in my group agreed that the drinks tasted terrible. I haven't tried the food but it sure did look and smell delicious! The ambiance and service helps give this place some stars, but the drinks are worth 2 stars at most.", "name": "\nLex G.\n", "location": "\nHamden, CT\n"}, {"rating": "4.0", "review": "3.75 starsI've been here several times, all for different types of occasions, and the norm seems to be that the food is great, the drinks vary in quality and consistency, and the service is hit or miss. If you pick and choose the good items or good days, Barrel is easily a five star establishment. However, the vicissitude of each experience has not followed a pattern and I'm left wondering what my next trip to Barrel will have in store.Barrel is close enough to our house to walk and we've certainly taken advantage of this convenience. Our first trip was for a happy hour and we were able to snag a high top table in the front on the main floor for ourselves and another couple. The HH drinks include a cocktail or select beer for $5. We nibbled on the HH biscuits and ham and BBQ buns while we waited for our friends and were highly impressed with the country biscuits. The honey butter melted as soon as it touched the mini-biscuits. I could easily have eaten half a dozen of these. Our other food selections for the evening matched the quality but the drinks were a bit of a letdown. The inconsistency of the drinks became most apparent when two of us ordered the same drink in different rounds and they tasted markedly different. Cocktail mixology is a lot like baking; even the slightest error in proportions can ruin a product. Perhaps that's why all of the barrel aged cocktails were far superior to those made to order - they involved no measuring on the spot and thus needed little attention from the bartender on a busy evening.Learning from our first experience, Justin and I stuck mostly to barrel aged cocktails on our second trip - a low-key summer dinner for four. By this point the menu had transitioned from being mainly small plates to only appetizers or entrees. The entrees were all outstanding. In addition to being somewhat Southern-focused, there is an abundance of seasonable vegetables and some gamey meat. The wild boar pappardelle was rich and flavorful, second only to the gnocchi with rabbit carnitas which was perfectly balanced by contrast of the intense flavors of fonduta and bacon, and the fennel and fava beans. The portion sizes were just right, too. Big enough to be a satisfying meal yet not enough to make you sluggish.After the near perfect experience at dinner, I picked Barrel as my going away brunch spot (one can never have enough going away celebrations). It seemed a bit odd that I was told over the phone that I wouldn't need reservations in advance, even for a party of six, but seeing as they hadn't been serving brunch for very long at this point, I didn't overthink it. The pendulum swung the other way, and this experience was lacking in service and timeliness of the kitchen's output. The \"pick your own meat\" Bloody Mary was a big hit after seeing the menu but the execution of it was inadequate. You're charged an extra $4 for the meat/garnish (which isn't noted on the menu), but all of them were missing parts of the garnish, which the waitress didn't mention and the price didn't reflect. Despite weak drinks with missing ingredients (at $14 each after picking your own meat), we ordered our food, knowing that at least that would be good. The food was good...for those of us who received it. Each of us ordered one main and they didn't come out at the same time. These aren't tapas that can be staggered; by the time the last person had received their entr\u00e9e, the first was done eating. There was neither an explanation nor an apology, and really there was no excuse since we were practically the only table in the restaurant. This was surprising since the service on our other two visits had been friendly, informative and attentive. It's really quite sad that the focus of this meal became a question of if/when everyone would actually receive their food rather than the food itself, as my pulled pork pupusas were amazing and full of flavor. They definitely knew how to cook in that kitchen, just apparently couldn't cook multiple things at the same time.The inconsistency in service and beverages isn't enough to mar our desire to revisit Barrel - at least not for dinner. Of note, the downstairs bar does have a different cocktail menu but is closed on Mondays and during brunch. At your request, the upstairs bartenders can make the items from the other menu. And for those who don't care for bourbon, the majority of the cocktails are with other spirits.

Before we went, I did a little research and found out the owner of Barrel also owns Union Pub near Union Station. Since everyone knows only tools go to Union Pub, I was trying really hard not to judge Barrel before giving it a try (to avoid being a tool myself). There's an upstairs and a downstairs both with their own bars. The downstairs looked cooler than the upstairs, but the tables were too big so we went upstairs. We each ordered a drink. I got the Raspberry Elyx Mule and it was just okay. If you like spirit forward drinks, you'll love the Bucket and the Greenpoint.For an appetizer, I ordered their baked beans and it was amazing! Then out came our main dishes and that is when we started to get confused. For a restaurant/ bar that looks very manly, the dishes were tiny! I ordered the BBQ pulled pork buns and three very small sliders came out. My friend ordered the scallops and they should change the name to scallop because there was literally just one of them. All the food tasted good, but we were all still hungry afterwards. And we waited, and waited, and waited for our server to finally come by and ask us if we were done (There's grace for new servers).Warning: If you do not like smokey flavored food, don't go here. Many of their dishes have a hint of the taste of a campfire. I give this place a three.

The pope was in town and we were blessed immediately with a table for 3, no wait. Thank you Papa! I had friends who went over the weekend and had to wait almost 2.5 hours so you know this was a miracle in itself.I usually write about service as an afterthought of a meal but from the moment we walked through the door we were greeted with a woman who was rocking the biggest smile / best red lipstick game ever. Everyone who came in contact with us afterwards was very gracious, knowledgeable and efficient which was very surprising since they have only been open for a few weeks now. Huge kudos! Every detail was well thought out from the fork and spoon serving sets (most Filipinos forego the knives) to the extra plates that we were given (and replenished) so we could share our dishes appropriately. Speaking of the dishes -- everything was superb! While most of the restaurants in town do a good job of cooking homestyle dishes that your Lola or auntie would make, Bad Saint kicks everything up about five or ten notches up. Everything was very stylish in presentation and you can tell was prepared by someone with a chef's palette. Complimentary Appetizer - Prawn Crackers with a side of Shrimp Paste (Bagaoong). This was definitely a nice touch! My husband has shunned bagaoong his whole life but discovered a taste for it here. Miracle #2!Kinilaw: Basically thinly sliced tuna ceviche. This surely blows my grandpa's version out of the water and is a great starter. This came out with the quickness!Ukoy - Sweet potato, shrimp fritters. This was a favorite snack growing up but Bad Saint's version is a little less latke like and has more of a bird's nest texture. This allowed the oil to cook all of the little crevices and cook it so the whole thing was super crispy . Served with some chili salt to sprinkle on top. Yum, yum. The extra okra in it made me feel less guilty because I did not order anything in the vegetable section. Ginisang Tulya - This was recommended as a favorite dish by everyone who worked there but quite honestly I was doubting how good manila clams could actually be. I was wrong, this dish was absolutely fantastic. Make sure to ask for extra rice to soak up all of that good salty broth -- the chinese sausage adds a nice sweetness to everything too.Adobong Pusit - Squid, adobo style! One of my favorite dishes ever and goes well with extra rice (I'm a carb-a-holic, can you tell?). The little garlic crispies were a nice touch. Pancit - A traditional Filipino fiesta dish this was the most fanciful and flavor packed version I have tried in my entire 30 years of life.Tapa - When you look on the menu you think you are ordering this in salad format. I'm fat so thank goodness this was not the case...It was served with more rice and the most dope looking egg I have ever seen. ***THREE CHEERS*** \u00a0It reminded me of my favorite Laos beef jerky + my favorite Vietnamese shaky beef dish mashed up together with a Filipino twist. And because I'm super hedonistic:Bilo Bilo for desert. Purple rice in a coconut cream with seared peaches. This was my first time ever trying bilo bilo and I was a fan! The fat purple rice pieces rolled around my tongue like a happy little baby. It was the perfect way to end the meal.They also gave everyone a complimentary piece of biko which is a caramelized coconut rice cake that is seen at almost every Filipino party you will ever attend. What made this special was the salted rice puffs on top which was a welcome and nice surprise.They also have a nice but small collection of Asian inspired cocktails and of course San Miguel beer.After all of this food I was prepared to harvest my liver in a box as payment but everything was surprisingly very, very affordable.

Nope! I was even told that I might not get a seat that night-- I put my name on the waitlist for the actual list. Luckily, after finally finding a place to get a drink and linger down the street, I got a text saying a table would probably open up between 9:15 and 9:30 (though it ended up being closer to 9:45 before we sat down). I don't have much of a point of reference for Filipino food, given its dearth in the area (and I guess my lack of Filipino friends), but I was eager to try everything. My favorite items were the kinilaw, which was a lightly seared, tuna ceviche-type thing that had tons of flavor (despite my usual meh feeling on raw fish), the clams (!!!) with the chinese sausage (definitely get those clams in the sauce-- where all the clammy goodness has gone), the bitter melon with egg, tomato and black beans (I don't usually like bitter melon unless it's red and ripe) and the purple rice dessert with peaches and plums (despite being super full I couldn't stop eating it). The shrimp fritters with sweet potato and leeks wasn't bad, it's kind of a lacy, crunchy web that you dip into fish sauce, but it didn't blow me away. I also found the rice noodles all right but not something to write home about (though I'll say it kept very well as leftovers-- didn't congeal or feel greasy when I reheated it in the microwave the next day). All the portions and prices seemed pretty reasonable-- the first couple of items in the section tend to be smaller plates, while the latter few are larger, but it's great to share everything.

The first time my friend and I attempted to dine here (it was a Tuesday night), we were turned away at the 1 hour before closing mark because not only is there limited space, but there was already a long queue of eager diners. Fair enough. We were better prepared this time around and arrived an hour and a half before closing on a Saturday night. ***END PSA***We decided to grab a drink at Wonderland Ballroom during our 30-minute wait and received a text as soon as our table was ready (I love it when restaurants utilize technology). I'd like to take a moment to thank the food gods for blessing us with THE BEST seats in the house. We were seated at the bar stools right next to the door where we could feel the summer breeze, and right in front of the bar where we could watch all of the magic cocktail mixing happen. Not only that, but we also had a crystal clear view of the entire open kitchen.Bad Saint can be characterized as stylish, creative and a breath of fresh air. The atmosphere was wonderful with its high ceilings, open kitchen, and modernized decor. The feel, the fact that you can watch everything being made, and the aromas made for a more engaging dining experience than you can find anywhere else in the city (fair warning, you WILL smell like food after you leave).I am not much of a Filipino food connoisseur, but I have had your usual pancit, lumpia, longanisa breakfast with garlic fried rice and eggs, halo halo and taron at a few friends' houses as well as a few restaurants in New York City. Like Kimberly S. had mentioned in her review, Bad Saint takes traditional Filipino food and \"kicks it up 5 or 10 notches\". Everything was very skillfully crafted with precision and down to the last detail.INIHAW NA LIEMPO ($14 pork belly, acharra, tamarind sauce): Think pork belly butter lettuce wraps. Although tasty, I felt that the pork belly was too dry. My friend and I both agreed that this was our least favorite.UKOY ($8 freshwater shrimp fritters, sweet potato, leeks): The shrimp was great but the texture was too crunchy as if it was in the deep frier for far too long. I would have preferred a softer and chewier center with a light to moderate crispiness on the outside. Simply put, it was more veggie chip-like than fritter-like. This also came with what seemed like chili salt and a lime based sauce on the side, which I did not care for because the sauce was too salty.PINIRITONG ISRA ($24 whole fried dorado, lemongrass, and tomatoes): Perfectly fried and well-seasoned fish. This was one of my favorites of the night as the sauce was very palatable. (comes with a side of garlic rice which is a plus)TAPA ($16 dried beef, duck eggs, green salad): The most enjoyable dish of the night. To plainly describe the dried beef, it was a savory beef that was 50% to beef jerky status. The egg was poached to utter perfection, the garlic rice was rich with mouth watering flavor, and the salad and onions tied everything together quite nicely on the palate. One thing that I noticed was that the garlic rice in the Tapa is ten times better and more flavorful than the garlic rice that was given with the fish. There was a sauce that came with this as well, but I was not a big fan of it, as it was far too salty. Being Vietnamese, I mistakenly doused my bite (thank goodness it wasn't the whole thing plate) with the sauce as if it was the sauce that we use in our culture called nuoc mam (fish sauce), and felt instant regret as soon as it hit my tongue.Overall, a great place.

We were seated without any trouble and our waitress was a gem throughout the experience. I ordered a delicious Manila sling cocktail. At this point, the restaurant can do no wrong. I'm cozy and feeling very welcomed. As a vegetarian, my options were limited (four) but I kind of prefer that. Makes choosing less difficult. I ordered the bitter melon and the rice noodles with mushrooms. the rice noodles came out first and I could only get a few bites down. The food was WAY too salty. Disclaimer: I'm very open to different flavors and like eating a wide range of dishes. I had the same salt issue with the melon dish as well. I couldn't continue eating my food because the salt was overwhelming...and I love salt. My boyfriend had the pork belly not listed on the menu. He said it was a bit dry and would give it a 5/10. He really enjoyed the clam and sausage dish however. The staff was extremely apologetic and extremely willing to make things right. They brought out the two other dishes I had not ordered completely void of salt this time. The additional dishes were fine but nothing to write home about.

My boyfriend and I originally ordered 3 plates but quickly realized that these plates are fairly nouveau-sized so we asked for our menus back to order more. +Ginisang Ampalaya {bitter melon, farm egg, preserved black beans}: $9+Kinilaw {tuna, avocado, chilies}: $12+Ginisang Tulya {littleneck clams, Chinese sausage, Sichuan chile}: $18+Inihaw Na Liempo {pork belly, acharra, tamarind sauce}: $14+Tapa {dried beef, farm egg, green salad}: $16We started off with Kinilaw, which was essentially tuna ceviche. Wonderful starter, not too heavy and great flavor with the chilies and avocado sauce. Next came the Inihaw Na Liempo. This was a delicious pork belly dish marinated in tamarind sauce and garnished with acharra. You eat them as a wrap and the pork belly is fantastic. Then, we had the Ginisang Tulya. The clams were tasty and we devoured the rest of the sauce with our rice, of which they were not hesitant to give us more. The Tapa is very, very good. I loved the farm egg and the mixture of flavors with the rice, salad, and dried beef. Finally, the Ginisang Ampalaya. If you're not a fan of bitter melon, this dish may be a little hard to swallow but they did a nice job of toning down the bitterness with the other ingredients. It's also a very healthy dish since bitter melon is chock full of nutrients. Overall, great food and wonderful service. A little pricier given their small plates but very unique cuisine.

Also its authentic vibe fits right into the 11th St neighborhood befittingly in between Wonderland and Room 11.What used to be a small beauty salon is now a cozy quiche Filipino restaurant/kitchen. Seating definitely is limited with only two real tables and the remainder of the seating is counter space. The bar has two seats, one additional counter seat is near the bar but actually facing the kitchen. Nick the owner was obviously present and he definitely did a great job embodying the Filipino spirit into his restaurant...the ambience with its wooden motif of ubiquitous objects you'd see at an auntie's house or the touch of family and Catholic roots with its paradoxically befitting but slightly irreverent candle-lit display of loved ones with a headless Santo Nino are nice details that make the place uniquely inviting. We are definitely glad we came on their first night since I am sure this upcoming Labor Day weekend, with word of mouth buzz, they will most definitely have a nice crowd coming in for dinner these next few days. There is a hostess at the door who will take down your name and phone number on a clipboard and will call you when a spot is open...we waited about 30min for two (MY ADVICE: get a drink at Wonderland while you wait since there really is no bar space to hang out at.... you don't have to physically wait in front of the restaurant if you don't want to since she will txt/call you!)Photos are posted along with the menu. They definitely get plus points for their cocktails particularly the Willy Santos, which has a nice touch of calamansi in it. The Zamboanga Zeinie also has a nice balance of cognac and pineapple.Their menu interestingly is not separated by appetizers, courses, and dessert. It's just one page separated into vegetables/salads, seafood, and meat...it's a bit tapas style with some at entree prices with the amount of food varying between each dish.From the \"Gulay\" section we got the Pancit Bihon Guisado, obviously a classic Filipino rice noodle dish. They use a very thin noodle and overall I had no complaints. A nice slice of lime or calamansi on the side would have made it perfect.From the \"Isda at Iba Pa\" section, we got the Ginisang Tulya which were essentially clams with sausage...HANDS DOWN our favorite dish of the night. Super flavorful and we even ate up the broth right down to an empty bowl!From the \"Carne\" section, we got the lumping shanghai, which are also your classic egg rolls (and props to them for denoting them as shanghai egg rolls which is the way most Filipinos will make them compared to other variations)..and yes they were cooked extremely well and were appropriately thin and golden brown.The inihaw na liempo was essentially like a pork belly lettuce wrap..smaller in appearance than what I expected but was great with its tamarind sauce.And their chicken dish the inasal na manok...the chicken itself was cooked well and taste good but what elevated it was the purple rice that came with it....I was expecting more of a chicken adobo but their intention may have been more of that street BBQ style chicken.And YES they do have one dessert dish...and no it is NOT halo-halo nor is it ube ice cream...they had an interesting version of \"bilo bilo\"which is sticky rice in coconut milk with theirs having clumps of plums in it. I grew up with it having more doughy balls in it hence this one was more porridge like. Note this is NOT on the printed menu (yet?) but if you ask the waitress about dessert she will let you know about it.The cooks were nice enough to even give us an extra treat before we left and was I guess dessert dish #2...biko! Another sticky rice dessert as a cake version....yes filipinos do love their sticky rice!Overall, everything was nicely done with many classic and authentic styles all with their Bad Saint twists..I liked how everything had some acidity or tartness to it which is the flavor I grew up with...their start-up menu definitely has room to expand and grow and look forward to what they have to offer in the future.Nick the owner, the cooks, hostess and waitresses (thanks Stephanie!) were all great and welcoming. Obviously as their first night run, they all seemed super focused at getting things done right and well....and I don't blame them!

In short, this place is amazing, everything is good, you should go.Apparently the restaurant seats 26 people in total, and you'll have to have everyone in your party with you before you're seated. We showed up right when it opened at 5:30. Besides a little strangeness at the beginning with the seating, the service was terrific from the hostess, waitress, and everyone else. The waitress came at appropriate times to take our orders, and water was refilled promptly; no problems with service at all.We had the inihaw na liempo (pork belly), pancit bihon (rice noodles), lumpiang shanghai (eggrolls) and tapa (dried beef). Of the four dishes, our favorite was the tapa. I wasn't actually expecting to like the tapa that much simply because it was one of my favorite dishes that my grandma used to make. But the tapa, while a little pricey, was excellent; not too tough, marinated perfectly. The garlic rice was perfection. When it said it would come with a green salad, I was a little skeptical, imagining some green lettuce plopped on the side. What actually came with it was quite refreshing; herbs and fresh red and yellow tomatoes. I also loved the soft-boiled egg. Get the tapa!My second favorite was the pork belly. I didn't know what to expect but it was very well-cooked, melt-in-your-mouth quality. I thought the lumpiang shanghai was fine, but honestly I prefer the versions at your local turo turo and I thought the version here was maybe a bit too high-brow, but I would still recommend it for a meaty appetizer. The pancit bihon was a little bit of a disappointment. The quality of the dish was very good; the woodear mushrooms were as well-made as they could be; but I thought that the dish was overpowered by ginger. I also, perhaps unfairly, am comparing it to my grandma's pancit bihon, and nothing can top that... But for a varied noodle dish with a lot of vegetables, I'd recommend it. It's also a sizeable portion too for the price.For dessert we had the biko; you have to request it from the waiter. It was okay, the coconut more of an aftertaste than the primary flavor. The crispies on top of it were a nice touch. Even better was that it was actually complimentary from the restaurant (thank you!)The only thing I feel like I would have wanted to have known beforehand, was that it was pretty warm; there was decent air circulation, but if you're sensitive to heat and smoke (the kitchen and grill could literally be at your back), then maybe wear something light or go when it's cooler. We showed up early because we didn't want to wait, but on a Wednesday at 7 pm the restaurant wasn't full. So, I implore you: go to Bad Saint, stat.

Food (3/5): The menu changes frequently, and the three sections are smartly divided into Veg, Fish, and Meat options, with portions listed in ascending order--no appetizers. The limited choices give it a more homey feel; it makes sense in a small restaurant context where kitchen staff can focus on doing a few things right rather than a bunch of things all at once; you know the food's fresh. Ample vegetarian options, and there's always something off-menu. I had the little-neck clams and pork belly (off menu), my girlfriend had noodles and bitter-melon hash (forgive me, I forgot the exact name). Pork Belly: Big points for creativity; served bite-size w/ a sweet/sour chutney and a slice of spicy pepper to pop through the fat, on top of carrot/pepper pickle--a perfect flavor combo, though the actual meat came out tepid, and had been slightly overcooked to the point of being dry/tough. Not the best meat, but excellent presentation/overall flavor. Clams: Served w/ Chinese sausage in a briny and spicy sauce--these were fantastic and filling when combined with a little rice-bowl. Veg Dishes: Both the noodles and bitter melon came over-salted and unfortunately my (vegetarian) girlfriend was unable to finish them. Had the salt not been a factor, the bitter melon hash would have truly been an interesting flavor; definitely worth trying as an accompanying dish. The attentive staff immediately apologized and replaced her dishes with a bok-choy stir fry and salad. Both these latter dishes were tasty (and deeply appreciated), but missed on unique flavors. The salad seemed to be a simple vinaigrette with mango added; the bok-choy was (very understandably) under-salted. We could tell they tried very hard, and so we appreciated these nonetheless. Drinks (5/5): Super creative options utilizing genuine Filipino ingredients and liquors that I'd never heard of. Flavors really popped, and the waitress explained each cocktail in loving detail. The cocktails we ordered featured subtle, fruity, and floral notes, very well balanced so as to round out both acidity and sweetness. Staff (5/5): Possibly among the best service I've received in DC. Kind, attentive, and unpretentious. All this, without being overbearing or rushing in spite of the space's limited capacity. The waitress carefully and eagerly explained all aspects of the menu to us, and their connection within Filipino cuisine (of which my knowledge is limited). She, and the hostess, came to check and make sure that our replacement vegetable dishes were to our satisfaction, and we were not charged for the dishes we had to send back. The restaurant is clearly in a learning phase, and as time goes on, they will undoubtedly refine their creative menu. Atmosphere (5/5): Cozy; if you've been to Toki Underground on H street or Izakaya Seki's downstairs room, that would be a good yardstick for the feel you get at Bad Saint. Great, diverse music selection, including classics from the Philippines and solid hip-hop, none of which was distracting or too loud. The sounds of the kitchen give it a nice din; at one point though, the whole place filled with smoke from some dish; we didn't mind (in fact the haze added to the atmosphere) but it might be an issue if patrons are prone to coughing/irritation. Overall, definitely worth a try. I'd like to come back here in several months and see how the place has evolved.

I have to mention the drinks. My friend had the Willy Santos and happily downed it so quickly that I was thankful for the sip I snuck when it arrived. I am a wine drinker, and was surprised that there were only three wine choices -- but know that those choices were specially picked to be perfect with the Filipino menu.

Next was the Ukoy (shrimp in a tempura-type breading with strands of sweet potatoes and leeks), and the Pancit (noodles with mushrooms/veggies) came last.

They're like a long skinny fried spring roll with beef, pork, and cornichon (the waitress said the cornichon was the chef's mother's secret ingredient) and they come with a chili vinegar dipping sauce. They were rich and flavorful with great bracing acidity from the vinegar. I could have eaten my body weight in those. We moved on to the rice noodles. They were deliciously salty and garlicky with lots of vegetables (Woodward mushrooms, baby zucchini) and little crunchy rice surprises. Next came the tuna jaw. It is half of the actual jawbone of a tuna so it was pretty big and you have to work to get the meat out of all the crevices of the bone but man is it worth it. The meat has different consistency in different parts of the bone--some parts flaky like salmon, other parts fatty and chewy like toro sushi or a rare steak. Finally we got the dried steak, which came with rice and a green salad. The rice was toasty ( I think there were nuts in it) and the herbs were a nice fresh foil for the salty beef.

How would I ever be able to replicate the food experiences I had with '3 Salsas' with any other place? I'd tried Taqueria DF and was terribly disappointed. But then, at the urging of my boyfriend, I decided to move on. After all, that decision was made for me with the last taco served by '3 Salsas.' Not far from the now-abandoned shell of the former '3 Salsas' lives Taqueria Habanero. Reluctantly, I tried Taqueria Habanero.Taqueria Habanero, I must say, makes an acceptable substitute. It makes a deliciously wonderful substitute. Their tacos (the pollo and pescado are my favorites) are phenomenal. The pollo, coated with some raw white onion and some cilantro, served in their homemade soft tortilla shells, rivals that of '3 Salsas.' Their pescado, however, is without a doubt my favorite taco in DC. Slices of avocado top a lightly fried white fish, drizzled with a sauce that almost tastes like it has a Thousand Island dressing base, though I may be missing the mark on that one. It's good. Real good. Pairs well.Their quesadillas are fried large tortillas, served with a side of a pico-style shredded lettuce. For the quesadilla, I've tried both the cheese option as well as the chorizo quesadilla. The latter, I must say, is a gluttonous greasy heaven. Not quite as good as a '3 Salsas' quesadilla, but one of the better options in DC.As for their side sauces (verde, roja, and their habanero), I recommend asking for at least one of each.

While, they have the authenticity part down with the homemade tortilla and salsa, I just wasn't blown away with the flavor. The salsa they provided were both tasty. \u00a0They both had a smooth, liquid consistency. The red had a nice smoky kick to it and the green was cilantro based.

I normally love al pastor, but wasn't impressed with this one. \u00a0It was pretty salty and had no sweetness to it at all, which is odd since the addition of pineapples normally does.

Few have vegetarian options and most are overpriced for either the quality or quantity of food (sometimes both). However, Basil Thyme had three different options, and all of them looked fantastic. Admittedly, when I saw the cost my eyebrows shot up and I almost walked away. But a co-worker owed me lunch and strongly recommended them. Basil Thyme has the option to mix'n'match their lasagnas so I chose the most obvious of the vegetarian meals, \"Maria\", and something more exotic. It's my personal preference to always order the most representative and popular food items when I try a new food vendor. If a taco, hamburger, or what-have-you isn't worthwhile I'm cautious about getting something more adventurous. Especially since when I think of American-esque Italian restaurants I tend to think of incredibly bland or lackluster meals. The Maria lasagna IS basic, but their portioning of zucchini, cheese, and spices feels original. If the sauce was ever canned it's not obvious. Their current special is a butternut squash lasagna with just the barest hint of cinnamon and sweetness. The goat cheese is surprisingly mild and fantastic. I expected the flavors to be overwhelming or too rich, but with a half serving it was just perfect. Not only that but that combination of flavors isn't something you \u00a0normally crave during the summer, but it complements their \"Maria\" lasagna really well. Both lasagnas were well cooked and just the right level of warm when handed off to me. There was no excessive grease, no burnt ends, and no lukewarm spots in the middle. On the side was a spring mix salad with a light splash of dressing. My co-worker pointed out that they have a combo option where for an additional dollar (one. dollar) you can get a drink and dessert. For a DC lunch the price, combo or not, is fairly strong. There's plenty of restaurants and trucks selling at the same price point with less food or with less quality in their servings. For vegetarians in particular; the options are slim and sometimes we're charged as much or more for a scant meal. \u00a0With Basil Thyme, I could easily eat half of the entree and all my salad, then eat the second half the next day.

I could tell the start was a little rocky, but now they've got an ipad system and the ordering is smooth and lines are quick.Basil Thyme 1 (Lasagna):My first review for the original Lasagna truck stands firm. I've tasted their Giuseppe, Butternut, Linda (Traditional) and Lobster. All are truly gourmet. Those commercials where they serve pizza hut pasta in a fancy restaurant, then tell people \"hey it's actually pizza hut!\" -- this truck could do that and come out with flying colors. For the rest of my comments, see the original review I made for this truck.Basil Thyme's 2 (Pasta):It's hard to resist faulting them for not having cannolis at this truck after they offer them on BT1 with a combo. But, as we are told every so often, there's just not room on this truck. Ah well... first world problems right?My go to on BT2 has been the Fettuccine Buerre Blanc with Shrimp. To no fault of the chef or owner, this creamy dish always feels like I need to run an extra 2 miles afterward -- but so worth it. If that's not your thing, they have enough sauces to please any mood. Lately they've been featuring interesting ravioli dishes, and today I tried the ravioli stuffed with beef brisket. It was ridiculously outstanding. I will warn you, if you are in the mood for a bigger meal, go with a pasta dish over a ravioli. The ravioli portions aren't as big, but definitely more savory and recommended if you want a lunch of a more \"normal\" size. I tried the meatballs once and honestly those are probably the one thing that didn't feel floored by. They were just a little dense and overly spiced for my taste. Though as a half-Italian American, perhaps this is one area where nothing can compare fairly to what Grandma makes at home.BT2 is still coming up with new pasta, sauce and specialty creations, so keep checking them out. You'll probably never get bored - I haven't!Overall:I really feel like Brian, the owner, tries to go the extra mile for his regulars. He knows my name and takes the time to have a brief chat with me each week (even if it's between customers, which is totally understandable). Could this be Cheers on wheels? Maybe not, but it adds to the experience.Payment note: This truck does accept credit cards, however it's meant as a last resort if you forgot cash.

They were also sweet to accommodate our baby, which is much appreciated (she's super-well behaved so we think nothing of bringing her along, but you'd be SHOCKED at the amount of death-stares we get for doing so).The menu is impressive -- the burgers I mentioned, delightful burrata, a mezze platter, interesting seafood dishes -- basically, something for everyone and all the drinks to go along with it.

The duck fat fries were disappointing - the fries were lukewarm & you could not taste the duck fat at all (very sad since I absolutely love bread slathered with duck fat and was hoping to taste something reminiscent of it.)

The beer selection is extensive as well. The place is really big so you can either enjoy a few drinks at the bar or have a nice dinner at the dining area. I only had to wait one time for dinner but it was worth it (only 15 mins). The staff really makes this place 5 stars plus. Their brunch is really GOOD. One of the best brunch dishes I've had in DC, I ordered the hash salmon benedict and it just melted in my mouth with every delicious bite. There is a bottomless drink option for $15 (or $18...I can't remember) dollars per person during brunch and a build your own bloody mary bar. DO IT.

It was literally just breaded chicken on top of three soggy waffle wedges. - Lobster Roll - My #1 lobster roll pet peeve = excessive mayo.

Between 5 people we had the duck fat fries, their blue crab mac and cheese, 10 spiced wings, and the soft pretzel with smoked gouda for an appetizer. At that time the blue crab mac and cheese wasn't on the menu so I think the waiter was kind enough to let us get it. For entrees we ordered the 2 orders of the lobster roll and 2 orders of the chicken and waffle. As far as the food goes the best dish was probably the 10 spiced wings.

It seemed like they were frozen, if they are going to charge $19 for this dish it better be fresh waffles. The lobster roll was drenched in mayo which I was not a fan off. The pretzel when dipped in the gouda cheese was very salty, I would recommend scraping off some of the salt if you want to eat the pretzel dish. Their duck fat fries were unique and everyone else at the table enjoyed it.

The service is pretty good. \u00a0The server was very attentive and knew the menu pretty well. \u00a0She also moved quickly towards providing beverage refills and removing finished plates.I tried the Korean Short Ribs, Ten Spice Wings, Steak Frites, Lobster Roll and Blueberry Buckle.The Korean Short Rib Tacos came with pickled cabbage slaw, cilantro \u00a0and chili sauce. \u00a0Tasty little devils. \u00a0The short rib was moist and fairly tender. \u00a0The operative word in describing these tacos is little. \u00a0Three little tacos....for $13. \u00a0For the math majors, that's $4.33 per taco. \u00a0Crazy! \u00a0The Ten Spice Wings \u00a0are a popular dish at the restaurant. \u00a0They are dry rubbed and served with house blue cheese. \u00a0Ahhhhhh, just ok. \u00a0I'll admit that I tend to be more a fan of wet wings. \u00a0That said, I do like some dry wings such as the ones at Outback Steakhouse. \u00a0At City House, the first problem is they're fried way too hard. \u00a0That makes the skin pretty dry and also renders the rub kinda useless. \u00a0The rub is actually a little bland considering the moniker of \"ten spice\". \u00a0I did pick up a little sweetness at the end of each bite. \u00a0The meat is tender, which was nice. \u00a0The blue cheese sauce is very bland. \u00a0Overall, a flat dish.The Steak Frites consists of grilled skirt steak, duck fat fries, chimichurri, and salad. \u00a0Best thing about the dish was the fries. \u00a0The concept of them being fried in duck fat really didn't translate to flavor. \u00a0They were well seasoned though, had a nice balance of being tender/crispy and paired well with a garlic aioli sauce. \u00a0The steak was average at best. \u00a0While it was juicy, chewy is another word I'd use. \u00a0Bland is also another descriptor I'd throw out there. \u00a0The chimichurri \u00a0sauce is also maddeningly bland. \u00a0See a theme here?The Lobster Roll is composed of poached lobster, celery, green onion, mayonnaise, on a buttered roll. \u00a0I'll start with my side dish, which I subbed and turned into a side salad. \u00a0I have a problem with the movement towards so much bitter lettuce that seems to be happening at several places. \u00a0Who are they catering too...rabbits? \u00a0Bitter on bitter is not appealing. \u00a0Gotta have something to cut the bitterness a little and provide some balance. \u00a0Now, with the Lobster Roll....umm.....ok. \u00a0It was alright. \u00a0Want me to put it another way? \u00a0It was.....aiiiiight. \u00a0That's actually a more accurate description because I'm not sure it deserves the \"l\" or the effort it takes to properly pronounce the word. \u00a0A decent amount of lobster existed, but something was amiss. \u00a0I'm gonna say freshness was an issue because the lobster smelled a little off. \u00a0That may explain the tummy troubles I experienced later. \u00a0Scent aside, the most off-putting part of this dish was the price. \u00a0$26!!The Blueberry Buckle is the restaurant's spin on blueberry pie. \u00a0It was actually a decent dessert. \u00a0A little heavy and with a lot of crust/crumble, which made things a little dry. \u00a0I think it could have used a little more ice cream than the teaspoon I got. \u00a0Not bad though. \u00a0 This is the best way I can summarize my experience. \u00a0Ever get the bill and wonder how the f**k did it get to that point? \u00a0My bill was roughly about $100.

As in \"I would have sworn I went here with coworkers after that terrible meeting where Bill told us to redo all our TPS reports....\", no wait that was the other upscale craft beer joint with locally sourced chef driven bar snacks and a hyped burger (otherwise known as a gastropub)! It has a name that sounds mildly generic, and a concept that has been well played out nationally for the past half-decade. The d\u00e9cor and location doesn't help matters: it's a large space with lots of light wood finishes in an expensive drag of the district just like many other pricey district drags scuttling with lawyers and politicos. But lack of originality doesn't precisely need to be a bad thing, sometimes you just want a burger and a beer and to sit around burping on a barstool for a little while. And to that end, City Tap House fits the bill admirably. Be warned, this place hasn't exactly flown under the radar. It's extremely popular with the business lunch crowd, the game night watch party crowd, the casual dinner with buddies crowd, the why-the-heck-are-you-guys-all-out-on-a-Tuesday?! crowd. Sometimes you can get thrown an elbow even trying to squeeze into a bar seat for one. So even though it's a huge space, I would recommend reservations just to be on the safe side. \u00a0 \u00a0It's a little pricy, but that should be expected for the neighborhood, and it is much cheaper than other places you can grab lunch nearby (I'm lookin' at you, Del Campo). The food is largely delicious, with some bright patches of creativity scattered throughout the menu. The chef here seems like he runs a tight ship; food comes out at a good pace, even when the restaurant is slammed. I've sampled:-Duck fat fries with Truffle Aioli: NO. STOP IT. PUT THE DUCK FAT DOWN AND BACK AWAY FROM THE TRUFFLES. BAD CHEF, GO SIT IN THE CORNER AND THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO YOUR MENU! This is how I feel every time I read \"truffle\" or \"duck fat\" on a menu nowadays. I get it, it sounds fancy, it sounds indulgent, it sounds like a good way to trick people into spending huge amounts for fried spuds. But it's just a damn French fry, people! Don't guild the lily lest you want some eye rolling from me. So saying, these were good fries in the only ways that matter: not greasy, not limp, thick enough to stand up to serious dipping and have potato tasting soft innards, and with some crunch skin still on some fries. \u00a0-Sweet corn and crab hushpuppies with honey-thyme butter and citrus remoulade ($14). Delicious. I have not a single thing I would change about this. The texture on the puppies was perfect, with a solid dark brown outside crunch and cornmeal inside. The crab also shines through in the puppy, which is really quite hard to pull off in anything battered and fried, given crab is such a delicate flavor. The sauce (or remoulade for you fancy foodies) paired perfectly, and cut through the fat.-Lamb neck gravy with herbed ricotta and grilled bread ($10)-Very rich, very meaty, very very tasty. This is the type of dish you'd more expect to get from your grandmother than a restaurant. It has flavors that meld so well because they're slowly and lovingly cooked down for hours and seasoned just right. Not a single bite of this dish can be called light though, so I'd categorize this under \"salad eater's kryptonite\". -The tap burger ($14)- Solid, classic, and not bank-breaking. Thick patty cooked to ordered temperature. Not the best in the city by any stretch (that honor goes to Bourbon Steak), but not the worst either. Desserts are all delicious. If you have room, indulge! TL;DR: For what this place is trying to do (gastropub chic), it nails it.

The crab mac I intended to share. I didn't really share very well, it was too good. It definitely wasn't lump crab meat, very finely shredded so not sure how much was really in there but compared to prices of other crab macs I've had, this one was inexpensive so maybe that's why. Friends had some tasty beers and a bangin' soft pretzel! Get that! Plus it might be the cheapest thing on the menu. If you hadn't caught on, this place isn't inexpensive. I'm still getting used to DC prices. Some other friends met up with us after a while, all very happy with our venue choice. I had a sip of the Steigl Grapefruit Radler. Man that was awesome! It'd not beer which is why I like it but it tasted like what I would call a grapefruit cider. Kind of like Fresca but better. And alcoholic lolI'm looking forward to coming back some day, a friend in Adam's Morgan, Danielle P, has been here at least once a week for the past month so that speaks to how consistently good everything is.

Since I had approximately 12 people attending the surprise engagement I wanted to iron out the fine details of how I wanted the engagement \u00a0to go, so I called to make a reservation for a table. I called City Tap House and I was told that I would only have the table for 45 minutes, as it was a Friday night during peak dining time and the table and already been reserved for a certain time. I agreed to the amount of time and kept the reservation. I was now along with my party on our way to City Tap House. I along with most of my party arrived and I advised the receptionist I was present. The receptionist told me that the table was only reserved for 45 minutes and asked if I would be okay with that. I had told the receptionist that that would not be a problem and that I just needed it for a quick meeting and dry run of my engagement. The receptionist caught that it was for an engagement and she quickly ran to get and spoke with the manager Ryan, who came out and greeted me. Ryan wanted to know who was going to propose and I told him that that person was me. I had set up the whole evening to surprise future fianc\u00e9, which all of our closest friends and family were in on it. I also told Ryan that I had several people coming from out of town, even flying one in just for the night. Ryan told me that I could have the table for as long as needed that night. \u00a0Ryan had also just recently proposed and empathized with me.  Ryan seated us at a table in the back of the restaurant near the kitchen were my large group of family and friends had plenty of space to meet and prepare for the upcoming engagement. \u00a0Ryan then introduced Pearson who was the General Manager. Pearson greeted and congratulated me and asked me if I wanted more privacy. Pearson told me that he could move my party to a private room all the way in the back of the restaurant.

More a nice atmosphere to come watch a football game. A classier sports bar is what they're going for. The menu is a bit of an oddity. It seems like they aren't quite sure whether they want to be a classy steak house, which really isn't justified by the atmosphere, or an elevated sports bar. An example: the entree section on the menu has several $30 plus options, including filet minion and sea scallops, plus one $14 burger. This atmosphere doesn't lend itself to all the fancy schmancy entrees in my opinion. If they added a grilled chicken sandwich and black bean burger, i guarantee they would sell like hotcakes.As you may have guessed, my date and I both got the tap burger. Thankfully, it was delicious. The onions have really good flavor, and you can add avocado for $2. The burger itself was also seasoned well and was thick and juicy. I'd put it behind BGR and Duke's Grocery but otherwise this might be my number three burger in DC so far. I consider that pretty high praise.It's served with a healthy portion of duck fat fries as well. Nothing wrong with that.For the appetizer we shared the crab mac and cheese. It did not disappoint. Not too cheesy, not too fishy (great balance of the fish and cheese), and it tasted fresh from the sea. It also had a nice crusty top that I kept going back for.City tap house is keeping up with the joneses with a nice beer list, about 40 on tap and a few additional bottles, and they take the effort to offer many different styles to please all pallettes. I had the creme brulee stout from southern tier brewery, which had pleasant roasty aftertaste, and though it didn't taste overly sweet, it smelled like the most delicious caramel candy I could ever imagine.
