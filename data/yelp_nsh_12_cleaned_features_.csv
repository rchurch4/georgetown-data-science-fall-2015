"322 BroadwayNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"Three stars is pretty much on the money. I don't understand a Margaritaville in Nashville but I also am probably not the actual target demographic of these places...see: my dad who sometimes makes me think he can't find anything else on his XM radio other than Margaritaville. So we've of course been to the one in the Caymans and on Key West. Since clearly these are out of the way places, I didn't get in the way of my parents having their experience here. I was kind of hoping to avoid listening to music...or at least if I was going to have to listen to covers, NOT ""Call Me Maybe"" gone country. It's somewhat loud in here and I imagine as the night goes on it's louder. We were here prior to a hockey game but it was still pretty busy. Since I procured my family a free app coupon I decided I was worthy of the 5 o'clock somewhere which is a take on a Hurricane, which somehow in five years of legal drinking I have never had before. It wasn't bad. I imagine it's one of those things where you're like ""oh this barely tastes like alcohol, I'll have another"" and then suddenly you're hitting on someone you shouldn't be hitting on. Wait what.For that free app, we had the spinach artichoke dip. It wasn't bad, I certainly wouldn't have let anyone pay full price for it though. I wasn't feeling like having a full on sandwich or anything but there aren't really any smaller sized options. I guess a cup of soup but I had had soup for lunch and it was like obscenely hot for December so that was out of the question. I decided to just get the chicken quesadilla app and if I didn't finish it then whatever. The rest of my family had burgers or a chicken sandwich. The burgers were liked all around, although my brother got the diablo one and complained that it wasn't spicy enough. But I don't think he understands that poblanos aren't that hot.The quesadilla wasn't bad, there were some spots though where the chicken was a bit tough. Nothing you can't fix with a good bit of salsa though. Even though like I said it was pretty busy, we were there only about an hour. Service was great. Would I come back on my own? Probably not.

We did order some type of crab dip as an appetizer and it tasted good...best thing we consumed on our visit.Unfortunatly, the cons far outweigh the pros (at least on our visit).Cons: The food I ordered (seafood mac & cheese) had a good taste, but was over priced for what I recieved. Four pieces of shrimp and supposedly crab meat (however, I didn't detect any in my bowl).  My friend ordered a Cobb salad with fried chicken tenders.   Within three bites she was feeling ill. As a second opinion I tasted her food because she said something just didn't taste right to her. And she was right, something seemed off with the taste of the dressing and her chicken was bland and so dry that it was almost unedible. The manager did take her entree off of her ticket, as she should have and was very polite about it. The last con I have is that we ordered mixed drinks ($8+ a piece) and they were not mixed well at all. I left wondering if they bartenders receive proper training.

Before it came though, someone at our table ordered some nachos and there were plenty to go around. My burger was big and tasty and staying true to the song, went well with the Heinz 57 that I generously applied to it and with the french fried potatoes and with the big kosher pickle that came on the plate. The kids really loved the stilt walker / baloon artist. They can't wait to go back next time they come down. The adults in our group had mixed reviews on the food. Serving sizes were great but not everyone happy with the taste or quality, with someone saying something negative along with the ""C"" word (Chain), but overall experience was very good and I will go back, especially when taking other out of town guests downtown.Only thing that kind of puzzled me is that we gave one of the kids a five dollar bill to give to the stilt walker and still don't know if he was or was not allowed to take tips.

"322 BroadwayNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"Worst experience ever! I went here this past weekend with a large group of girlfriends. We had high hopes and were disappointed quickly. As we were waiting at the bar to order drinks, a server walked by, bumped into a different patron, and spilled an entire tray of drinks on me! My hair was soaked, my dress soaked and ruined, and my cowboy boots were drenched. The server walked away without saying a word. Another patron came up to me with napkins to help wipe me off and ask if I was okay to make sure no broken glass was on me. (Seems like everyone else in Nashville was sweet and respectful..just not the workers at this bar.) A few minutes later another server came over to clean up the mess. I explained to her what happened and said that I knew it was an accident, but asked if there was any way I could get a free drink for the inconvenience. She first replied saying it was the customers in the bar's fault for never moving out of the way. (Nice customer service- if your bar is so full, follow your capacity limits.) I then explained that I understood it was an accident, that I wasn't the one in the way, and that I didn't think she was a bad server or anything, I was just asking politely for a free drink. She explained that she was a server there and wouldn't get me one. I then asked if there was someone else to talk to, which she said she would go find. 5-10 minutes later nobody came so we asked the bartender for the manager. The manager was just as RUDE! I explained that the server spilled a tray of drinks on me and he said it was my fault since I bumped into her. I explained it wasn't me that bumped her since I was at the bar. He then followed through with trying to say that I didn't even look wet. I asked him if he wanted to come over and feel my soaking wet dress which he then followed up with saying he wouldn't give anything to me for free. I asked if anything could be done for the inconvenience, I was open to any ideas, but he said there was nothing that could or would be done. Worst part- he never even apologized for the way I was treated, for blaming me, or anything. I would NEVER go back to this location!

We waited 7 minutes to be seated. I know this exact time, because I received a phone call as we walked in, so I excused myself and came in after that. That call was 7 minutes and 42 seconds. My party was still standing at the hosteess station. The restaurant was not half full. It appeared to be a slow night. There was no hostess or greeter on hand. We were asked had we been helped, and were finally seated by our server. I went directly to the restroom. Upon returning to the table within a few moments, drinks were being brought to the table. I immediately asked, ""Don't you all wait until all parties are at the table before taking orders. "" Our server, simply stated sorry. I ordered a strawberry lemonade as did the rest of my party. I was then informed, ""It may take a while, since we just ran out of lemonade"" so I ordered a sweet tea and water. We all placed our orders and waited patiently. We sat chatting amongst ourselves and drinking our drinks. Our server came and brought refills of water, to 2 of the 4 glasses at the table, while our lemonades and sweet teas were not refilled. Our food came, still no refills. At this point, I'm thinking did they run out of sweet tea as well? Finally I asked can I have a refill to either my water or sweet tea. Both of my glasses had ice only at this time. So I was given a refill of water. WOW!! Finally after waiting long enough I asked another server to ask my server for a sweet tea refill. Our food came, and I immediately asked for extra parmesan and croutons. A male server brought me croutons and dressing. The most upsetting part was the MOUSE that ran across the floor. At this point we asked for checks and were ready to go. While we sat there, my husband drank a sip of his water, and said it's time to go now in an upset voice. I asked him what's wrong, and he showed us a dead fly floating in his water!! As we walked out a CPK employee said thanks for coming, hope you enjoyed dinner and the show in a joking voice. This was a very upsetting experience. I don't see anything funny about it. Seeing a 4 legged critter race across the room while you are eating and the dead fly in a drink, plus the lack of service makes me never want to step foot in this restaurant again.

That pizza is well done, the BBQ sauce slightly sweet but not overwhelmingly so, and the red onions adding a bit of kick to the slices.  Still, it's not too different from other places that sell BBQ chicken pizza these days such as Boscos.

After spending some time on yelp and other review sites, I told my husband we would try Toyama. (It's close, decent reviews, moderate prices and attractive looking sushi rolls pictured on the menu) Walking in, the space is a lot smaller than I expected and I've also never seen a restaurant with the hibachi and dining tables all open and in the same room. You don't even have to spend the hibachi money to see the show! (Definitely a plus for me) There's also a bar/sushi bar area which is great for grabbing a beer and a roll.The service is alright. You can tell which people are new and are not and, being in the restaurant industry myself, it always makes me feel bad when I see the vets of a restaurant (usually a tall man with dark hair and a deep voice) always picking up slack of newbies who don't want to work very hard. You can also see the language barrier plays a role in the miscommunication of service which is a very difficult thing to overcome.

"15532 Old Hickory BlvdNashville, TN 37246",3.0,"If I could give this establishment zero stars, I would. The manager/owner (I'm not sure what position he holds) is extremely rude to every customer that walks in the door. He's an older man with glasses and a constant look on his face as if he hates his life and job. If you see him, be prepared for a world of rude and abrasive responses. On one occasion, we went in and were told it would be a 45 minute wait even though there were multiple tables (both hibachi and regular) open. While I have worked in food service as a manager much of my adult life, I understand there are circumstances that are often out of the managers' control in terms of who is working and how many tables a server may have. However, there is an appropriate and POLITE way to address the situation. Today I called the restaurant repeatedly to see what time they served lunch till. The phone rang and went to an answering machine each time. When we arrived at the restaurant, the man, who seemed more preoccupied with his laptop and sitting on his butt, was extremely rude to the guests in front of me as well as to myself and my family. He snapped as us and said they are closed at 2:30 - it was 2:15 when we walked in. If the restaurant closes prior to the posted time, they should probably lock the door or put a sign outside to avoid any customer interacting with this so-called manager. I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone and will never be back to be treated so poorly for over-priced, sub standard food. It is pity because we live so close and would probably be frequent guests at such an establishment. Between our group and the group in front of us, the restaurant lost out on hundreds of dollars of business. This has been a consistent experience and it is absolutely ridiculous.

"15532 Old Hickory BlvdNashville, TN 37246",3.0,"We (me + wife) initially started coming here as a friend has his birthday almost every year.  The performance cooking is sure to please anyone who has never seen it, and even those who have seen it a few times like myself.Our last visit here was on a Tuesday late October celebrating a friend of ours winning 3 Best of Nashville awards, and we came for some reason without a reservation (I believe due to too many ""maybes"" on the invite - don't know why really, I was not the planner).I did not expect to be seated at a grill, but was pleasantly surprised when we got there that they had more than enough space for us.  They were quite accommodating as chunks of our group could not make it on time and people had to leave before eating (too many things going on).  The waitstaff seemed to be running at exactly the right speed that night.When the majority of our party was gathered, the chef (Chad) came out, did a show that involved using spatulas to play something that resembled the music that started nearly every 1970's Kung Fu movie.  It was a cacophony of audio embellishment I had not expected or experienced before.He juggled eggs, made a flaming onion volcano, things went flying everywhere but not a single rice grain made it past the grill toward us.  The performance had the air of a professional who has done it so many times that he could be doing advanced calculus in his head and not skip a beat.He prepared the vegetarian orders first so as to not slather the tofu in meat juices.  He asked a bit about what defines a vegetarian / vegetarian food prep standards and the veggies there each had different answers with the consensus being prepping the tofu first would probably please most of the veggie world but that the vegans would probably be pissed that it was prepped on a grill post-egg.My meal was good, not excellent, but near the really good side of good.  My compatriots were all happy with theirs.  I was entertained and it did not break the bank.  The people at the restaurant were nice, attentive.  I find it odd that I have not found something to dislike there in multiple visits.The place is located 4 feet from where the front door to the old Nipper's Corner theater was if I'm not mistaken.  It's right next to a Jet's pizza, and slightly to the right of Publix if you're looking straight at it.  Parking is easy, the lot is well lit, and the only thing to watch out for is the dedicated Jet's Pizza delivery drivers (who appear to take great pains to not kill anyone)",Toyama House Japanese Steakhouse & Hibachi,6158371674.0,573.0,2010-10-27,"Nashville, TN",/biz/toyama-house-japanese-steakhouse-and-hibachi-nashville,4.0,58,"Washington, DC",Paul K.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.1622296,-86.774353,566.7091028370305,False,2515.0,2.9655172413793105,,2.9655172413793105
"15532 Old Hickory BlvdNashville, TN 37246",3.0,"My affair with the Hibachi or Teppanyaki style food has been going for more than 30 years. Benihana (out west) was my first and then Kobe's in Nashville became our standard. Because the bar was set so high with the ""pros"" in the business I was reluctant to try Toyama more than five years ago after it opened. However, their lunch menu prices were very reasonable there wasn't anything to lose. Wow! There was no reason to be reluctant...this place is great! Their sauces are headlined by Chad's ""Yum-Yum"" sauce complemented by the popular Teriyaki Sauce, Ginger-Soy, and Hot Chili Paste. The Ginger Salad Dressing is the kind with a bit a mayo and is very good. It has changed hands from the original owner but they retained their head chef (Chad) which is a huge bonus...because he is the one who makes all of the incredible sauces! All the chefs are great cooks but Chad keeps the kitchen running consistently. Each chef has their own idea of how done the steaks are and how long to cook the shrimp. On one hand the lack of consistency in food prep may bother some and on the other hand it's great the the food is somewhat nuanced by each chef. I like it. When in doubt...ask for Chad!I really enjoy the lunch at Toyama's and it's a great spot to ""see"" some stars that live in Nashville. However, for dinner, my affair with Kobe's just can't be overcome. The prices for dinner are similar but the ambience of a strip mall hibachi room doesn't compare with always ""recently renovated"" Kobe's. For those who enjoy Bento boxes and other Japanese food including Sushi they have a great menu to make your day. Also, for those who don't want to sit at the Hibachi Grill they have several 4 top tables. Sometimes, it's a bit quicker to grab a 4 top and order a meal (including hibachi) which is all prepared in the kitchen.

They give nifty frosted glasses for ice water, and oddly shaped (but usable) beer glasses. Adds to the fun.It is a family owned restaurant, according to one friend who knew the owner/waitress. The father cooks in the back, while the mother and daughter are waitresses/cashiers.Onto the food: we ordered family style. Pad Thai, Angry Shrimp, Basil Chicken, some kind of vegetable sautee, and Penang curry with shrimp. Prices of all those dishes ranged from $9-$13. We also got generous portions of white rice.In a word, all of the food was great. The Pad Thai was slightly saucier/oilier than I've had, but it was a pleasant surprise.

They were all well prepared (perhaps a bit too similar, but it was all great, so no complaints). I loved mixing the sauces with white rice.Each table is outfitted with a tiny carousel of 4 spices/sauces. My friends used these more than I did, but it's a great way to allow each person to customize to their own levels of spiciness/flavor.

"519B Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"What a cool model for a coffee shop.  Tart noted that Barista Parlor is in the former Golden Sound site--- not knowing that before, I thought it may have been an old mechanic shop that had been converted into a coffee shop.  Barista parlor has a small stage outside, a small coffered patio/dining area outside, and a spacious interior with ample seating and a badass coffee setup with equipment I've never seen.  Their coffee setup looks like a classy version of what Walter White's brief chemistry partner set up in Breaking Bad to make coffee in their lab.  The walls are lined with decorations and merchandise including nice travel mugs, artisan chocolate bars (at least 4 different brands), and jams.  While waiting for your order, it's fun to walk the perimeter of the shop and peruse the goods.Food: We had the BP Sausage Biscuit (biscuit, apple sage sausage, strawberry jam, added scrambled egg) and the Huntsman (scrambled eggs with white cheddar, skillet cornbread drizzled with honey, choice of bacon or sausage).  Both dishes were perfect.  The sausage biscuit is just what I loved from the ever unhealthy McDonalds or other fast food breakfast menu, but with local, high quality ingredients.  Oh, it was good.  Messy though--- you WILL end up with biscuit crumbs where you didn't imagine possible.  The huntsman was like a deconstructed sandwich--- if ever they update the menu, The Huntsman could make a kickass sandwich.  For the bacon lovers, their bacon is thick, crispy, and what I consider to be artisan.  Overall, WAY better food than I expected from a random coffee joint.  Next time, I have got to try their donuts.  They looked divine, particularly the apple fritter donut.  Mmm. Beverages:  Teas and coffees were very nice.  The price looks a bit steep at first, however, teas and coffees come with a creamer pot full with your refill of coffee or tea once you finish what is in the cup they delivered to you.  Basically, an order of coffee or tea is 2-2.5 cups of drink, not 1 drink.One small suggestion for improvement: get some salt and pepper shakers.  Though it sounds strange, I've adapted to a pinch of salt in my coffee.  It really smooths the flavor and adds depth and richness that can't compare to a standard cup.  Their staff are kind and brought me a pinch bowl of salt on request.  Especially with serving hot dishes, salt would be good to have around.I have no hesitation about returning to Barista Parlor whether I'm hungry, thirsty, or looking to people watch over a smooth cup of joe.  See you next time!",Barista Parlor,6157129766.0,253.0,2015-10-13,"Austin, TX",/biz/barista-parlor-nashville-6,5.0,329,"Washington, DC",Ali B.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,30.2711286,-97.7436995,1317.4395357709307,False,2568.0,3.662613981762918,3.75,3.660436137071651

"519B Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Let me start by saying I have a unique perspective on food as I travel the country constantly and the world pretty regularly.  I've lived in five major cities and Nashville is by far the smallest.  It is also worth pointing out that I live in EN and have tried BP once when they first opened, last year, and once this year, hoping for a change in experience. BP is a beautiful establishment. There is no doubt about that. However, that is where the pleasantries start and end. The staff is beyond pretentious as is their attempt to produce adequate coffee by use of a Chemex system anyone can obtain. In the amount of time it takes them to make a burnt cup of coffee, I could drive to the airport and probably back. It is far more expensive than the most expensive chain coffee, Starbucks. The hipster revolution, which is far from original and innovative as they are merely rehashing a 1960's and early 70's look with an 1880's and 1920's twist, infest the place. Having Local Honey in front doesn't do much to cut the level of pretentiousness either. Another overpriced goodwill like establishment masquerading as a trendy boutique. On top of that, they do not use locally grown coffee nor do they roast in house. In my travels I've seen far more unique establishments without the pretentiousness,  with far better coffee, less expensive, and produced in a timely manner that Durante leave late for wherever I'm going. Do yourself a favor, don't go to BP, spend the money to get a Chemex, a kettle(which you probably already own), and by the time you've made your first cup of pour over coffee, you'll have spent less money than a week at BP.",Barista Parlor,6157129766.0,4.0,2015-09-02,"Lockeland Springs, TN",/biz/barista-parlor-nashville-6,2.0,329,"Washington, DC",Chris H.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,,,,False,1647.0,3.662613981762918,3.75,3.660436137071651
"519B Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I have some mixed feelings about BP.On the one hand, the establishment and atmosphere is probably the coolest I've ever been too. The garage doors that open in the summer gives the place a very open and inviting appearance. It is also a decently quiet place, at least during the middle of the day when I have gone. Lots of people say it's super hipster, and although the employees give off that vibe, they play old school rap and T-Swift...which is def not hipster. On the other hand, their drinks are extremely expensive. There is a small coffee shop in my hometown that roasts all of their own beans and makes a mean cup of coffee (which has won national awards), for about $2 less than here at BP. So the price is really the only gripe I have, being a recent college grad without a job. But that may not be as big of a deal to other people.Was the coffee at BP good? Yes. Was it worth $6 and some change for an iced coffee? That is a question that people will answer differently. The establishment alone makes me want to come back again...and it makes me want to buy another motorcycle. :)",Barista Parlor,6157129766.0,5.0,2015-09-22,"Peoria, IL",/biz/barista-parlor-nashville-6,4.0,329,"Washington, DC",Taylor W.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,40.6938609,-89.5891008,678.8504357558176,False,1092.0,3.662613981762918,3.75,3.660436137071651
"519B Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Short version: Great atmosphere, fantastic visual experience. Coffee was underroasted and had that sour stringy flavor that characterizes underroasted beans. Biscuit sandwich was delicious though. This is an expensive place; don't be shy about asking how much stuff costs. Otherwise you might end up paying $10 for a chocolate bar.Long version:Barista Parlor serves up a fancy coffee experience on many dimensions. First of all the place is too cool for words--located in a converted garage with vintage motorcycles on display and for sale. Fabulous pendant lighting, interesting seating, and cool decor. They have old fashioned radios placed in various corners, and they are wired up to their central sound system with a turntable. I was also impressed by the fact that their equipment console was a modern style stand but made out of plywood. I like that mixing of the contemporary with the low end. I kind of want to live in Barista Parlor since it is just that neat.Ok, let's get to the coffee, food, and service. As a long time coffee aficionado who roasts beans at home, seeks out coffee experiences in different cities, and pays close attention to coffee related details, I had high expectations. Luckily we arrived when there was no line and the barista could attend to all our coffee questions. The coffee menu was a bit mysterious to me...it's not entirely clear what you are looking at or what you're getting. There's an element of ""visiting the sacred temple on the hill"" to this place. I had a hard time deciphering the devotionals, even with the assistance of our high priestess of coffee.By the way, be careful, because the religious totems (aka coffee mugs, tshirts, chocolate bars) are expensive. Like really expensive. Like $25 for a mug, $20 for beans, $10 for a chocolate bar, and so forth. Be prepared for additional sticker shock as a standard cup of coffee is $5. Now granted they do an individual pourover for each customer (there are no ready-made pots sitting around), but still...it's pricey.Well, given some of the descriptors on the menu, I asked if one of the coffees was a wet process or dry process bean. The barista went to ask another, and (unfortunately) from the answer, I could tell they had no idea what I was talking about.  Oh well....we ordered two coffees and one of their fantastic breakfast sandwiches. At about $8 a sandwich, it's a absolute bargain compared to the $5 cup of coffee.I have read other Yelper's comments on service here, and I see where they are coming from. This place is not set up for maximum efficiency. The only menus in the place are right at the cash register, so there is no way to for you to make a selection while waiting in line. Each drink is made by hand in the most labor intensive way possible. I sometimes wonder if this ""artisanal by hand"" process is overly Luddite. Technology helps increase efficiency, and society benefits from it. I think Barista Parlor may tip the scale too far in the other direction, because while they do have all the fancy coffee accoutrements (good espresso machine, good grinder, etc), the process by which the coffee is made and delivered to you is quite slow. When our coffees arrived, they were served on cute little wooden trays. You pour the coffee from a glass carafe into your own cup. The breakfast sandwich was also served on a wooden plank, accompanied by a denim napkin. Practicality aside, the napkin was cute but slightly less than useful. At any rate, the coffee and food were a feast for the eyes. At this point, I'm just happy to be there, happy to be alive, and happy that places like this exist in the world.So I take a sip of coffee. And here's where the magic dies...maybe it's a reaction to the overly burnt roasted bean style of Starbucks, but I've found that every time, every single time I've been to a so-called coffee fanatic type of cafe, the beans are underroasted. Severely underroasted. The taste of the coffee is always sour, stringy, and slightly watery. Underroasted beans impart a sour taste, and make for a terrible cup of coffee. To me, coffee should have a rich, rounded mouthfeel, with a fullness on the tongue, and either a caramel or chocolate essence with a slightly earthy feel. Maybe this is just my preference, but yeah. So it goes. Again, I'm disappointed by yet another fancy coffee place that lets me down. The breakfast sandwich was great though. Lovely, crumbly buttery biscuit, delicious egg, cheese and sausage, very flavorful all around.Well overall, I give Barista Parlor 3 stars. Five stars for ambiance and 2 stars for coffee and price point. Yes, I rounded down my average score, but lovely as the experience was, I don't think their coffee merited more than that.",Barista Parlor,6157129766.0,196.0,2015-01-28,"Crawfordsville, IN",/biz/barista-parlor-nashville-6,3.0,329,"Washington, DC",Christie B.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,40.0401991,-86.8990249,532.9507214771421,False,4726.0,3.662613981762918,3.75,3.660436137071651

I can see why it's on insta, it's a photogenic place. But that's really a testament to their styling and Americana theme. I mean, they have bandanas for napkins. It's that kind of attention to detail and thoughtfulness that's exhibited throughout the establishment. This location in particular (Gallatin Ave.), is in a renovated automotive shop, with garage doors and a huge open space.

I had the BP Breakfast Sandwich - I didn't know a breakfast sandwich could be this freaking good. Fresh bread (more than likely handmade), thick cut bacon, aioli sauce..etc. It was a generous size for a breakfast sandwich and one of the most delicious I've had. I took my time eating and savored every bite. I also had a chocolate donut, which I had no expectations for, but wow. It was fresh take on a classic. It was super soft, airy like a donut should be, and full of flavor. With the added bonus of a homemade marshmallow in the center. The coffee was on the same level of greatness. I had a hot latte with almond milk (which is a huge perk having non dairy options), and my boyfriend had a iced mocha. Both had a nice velvety finish, and great body.

I didn't purchase it (though I'm regretting it now) but I asked about it, and the lady at the cashier took the time to tell me about how it's made.

"519B Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Barista Parlor is, definitely, the sort of place which requires multiple visits to get. The first time I came here, I was pretty turned off. Unfortunately, the reviews which mention unfriendly baristas, confusing signage and nonchalant-to-hostile service really rang true. I can't imagine this sort of experience was/is the intention of the founder. I can't understand why this seems to be such a pervasive problem. In any event, I came and was quite satisfied never to return.Fast forward to a rainy evening, bad traffic and guests in need of a coffee break. I breathed deeply and ventured to BP once again. This time, I had a much more pleasant experience. The barista behind the counter was engaging. He answered questions, offered suggestions and made my party feel appreciated for having chosen to give this store money. Okay. I get it. Much better.I'd recommend going for one of the seasonal blends. On my first visit, I had the whiskey caramel and I couldn't finish it. For my tastes, it was too cloying and the flavor profiles within the cup competed, rather than worked together. It was not enjoyable. Upon my second visit, I ordered a seasonal tea blend I enjoyed much much more. The ordering process goes a bit like this: walk in, claim a seat on the reclaimed wood bench and lowrise table (the build out is nicely done; minimal, but that's the point). Walk to the front and hope that you know what you want. If not, take a gander at one of two (?) printed menus and hope that no one will roll his/her eyes at you for taking a minute. I was lucky enough (upon my second visit) to encounter a barista who answered questions and offered suggestions. As a result, my beverage, food and customer experience was greatly improved from my initial visit. And, speaking of food, go for the homemade pop-tart. My butterscotch chocolate chunk scone was too much for me. Again, for my tastes, the flavor combo curdled a bit in my belly. As you can read from my reviews, my sweet tooth is truth... and this was a pastry I didn't finish. That rarely happens. The pop-tart is a sugar bomb worthy of the calories and cavity risk.The problem with BP is that it can be painfully hip... almost to the point of farce. Parking can be a bit of a chore (tip: drive through to the other side, if entering from Gallatin). Music varies depending on who's working. My first visit's playlist verged on the you-need-Jesus-Tipper-was-right tip. My next visit was a trip down the '90s hip-hop road. I enjoyed that much more. The good thing about Barista Parlor is that it has a definite point of view. The bad part about it is that I don't know if the execution of said point of view is an ultimately sustainable business model. You simply can't make a habit of alienating the people who keep your lights on -- especially when the price point is so deliberate. I'm glad I made a return visit in order to improve my opinion.

I have yet to actually try the scone or macaroon because I had already eaten so much and wanted to eat them later. I will give my opinion on those later!The iced latte I ordered was so good.

"519B Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Hype about Barista Parlor abounds around Nashville and even into other states. As a Portland native who watched the coffee scene grow up and evolve into what it is today, who sat in Stumptown cafes twice a week for years, who worked for a high-end coffee roaster and who recently moved to Nashville, I hope that I have some credibility to bear. I first visited Barista Parlor in late 2013 or early 2014. I ordered a V60 cup of some single-origin by Madcap. While the profile appeared decent, it was shockingly watered-down. I thought it was a joke and it was a bit insulting after paying a premium for it, but I was down the road and not willing to go back and wait in line to fight about it.In early 2015, I went and waited outside, but sent in someone with $50, to get me a mocha with Stumptown Hair Bender and a bag of Fourbarrel Guatemala. Off we went down the road and I sampled my mocha in dismay and eventually disgust. To add insult to injury, my change was exactly $20 and, at that point, I felt a strong desire to go in and tell them something about themselves. Instead, I'm here to put them in their rightful place in a more public way. If you're not from Portland, you probably don't know that espresso shots in all Stumptown cafes are made with their own Hair Bender blend of beans. I consumed it in all manner of drinks, at ALL Stumptown locations in Portland, served up by many different baristas for years. I have also frequented any number of other independent cafes in Portland that serve Stumptown exclusively. So, when I say that I KNOW what Hair Bender is and what it should be, hear me.My ""Hair Bender"" mocha from Barista Parlor was not cohesive, lacked the subtle touch of sweetness I expect in a mocha and lacked any real body. In fact, in spite of my years of experience with this espresso blend, I would have never guessed that it was Hair Bender. It was absolutely shameful, in my careful analysis.Now about the Fourbarrel beans: At home, for drip brewing, I use tools by Technivorm, Bonavita, Rancilio and Baratza. (I also use a Bodom French-press once in a while.) I use filtered water and the whole bit. I brewed up the Fourbarrel coffee that probably cost me $25 of the $30 I spent the night before. Was it amazing and mind-blowing? No. It was decent, but I expect much more at that price point. I played with the machines and there was no sweet spot I could find. This is not $25 coffee - not even close. Once again, pitching it as such is shameful.You need to know that I did not first walk into Barista Parlor feeling cynical or convinced of all the hype; I just wanted some quality coffee. (My friends and I frequented Stumptown not because it was ""cool,"" but because the cups never disappointed.I can appreciate the atmosphere at Barista Parlor, apart from hints of SoCal-style pretense. However, at the end of the day - and with a name such as theirs - the coffee should be the main attraction and stand up on its own, regardless of atmosphere or conjecture from uninformed hipster hopefuls who consider Charbucks or Ugly Mugs to be points of reference.  So, if you want a quality cup of coffee in Nashville, keep looking. (For example: Eighth & Roast or Crema.)  If you want to throw your money away on coffee-flavored water, so that you can be seen at Barista Parlor or say that you were there, knock yourselves out.",Barista Parlor,6157129766.0,14.0,2015-01-24,"Madison, TN",/biz/barista-parlor-nashville-6,1.0,329,"Washington, DC",Stefan K.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,35.60558870000001,-88.85211899999999,689.0943224323436,False,3357.0,3.662613981762918,3.75,3.660436137071651

The service is very slow -- The long line leaves you with nothing to do during your wait, since there are no menus at the line's start. Instead, you don't have a chance to decide what you want until you get to the register, where the one menu is kept. This causes an extreme bottleneck in service.2. The coffee isn't special, and it's expensive for not being unique. The coffee drink I ordered was served in a short champagne flute, not nearly enough for a morning drink, which was my intention.3. Parking is difficult.4. It's very loud indoors.5. There's no welcome upon your entry.6.

I will address both of these complaints in order. Response to taking too long: yes, it takes longer than starbucks, it takes longer than most cafés. Barista Parlor is not like most cafés, they spend a lot of time making sure that the drinks are prepared carefully, a characteristic that is evident in their products. If you don't have enough time to sit down and chill out, you probably shouldn't come here. Response to being ""exorbitant"": two things. First, Barista Parlor is comparatively expensive, there is no denying this. However, they are not being at all deceitful, nor is the price range beyond the ""$$"" (i.e. $11-$30) rating yelp has it listed as. A cup of coffee is around 4-6, speciality drinks can be more expensive. Food is around $10, not huge portions but very high quality. I have a feeling a lot of these bad reviews are coming from people who were improperly referred to Barista Parlor.

Here, the barista is the rockstar, the customer is the lucky spectator.I ordered one of their brand name drip coffees. It was weak and not piping hot.

"519B Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"So, visiting from outta town, and I had gone to the location at The Gulch first. Here is my Yelp review for that other location - yelp.com/biz/barista-par…After reading the Yelp reviews, I was curious as to how this one was gonna compare, and even though I know that's a matter of preference amongst people, I liked the vibe here better. Though hipster like the Golden Sound location, and similar in that the space is converted from a mechanic shop, this one had a slightly more of an edgy feel to it - and is a true reflection of the neighborhood it's in - as with the Golden Sound location.I read some of the reviews here with regards to the customer service, and I can actually see why this might be the case. With all due respect, the guys behind the counter here seemed more straight and narrow, and to-the-point, and perhaps exude a different kind of vibe -  but not in a mal-intentional kind of way. This actually is what made this place work better for me more than the other location, and I really liked the rough-around-the-edges feel to this place.I ordered the same items also - Moto Biscuit (egg and cheese) - I made them add extra white cheddar cheese, and also asked them to slather some apple butter on it. This made all the difference over the one at Golden Sound.Unfortunately, their espresso machine was broken, so I couldn't have the Bourbon Barrel Vanilla Latte that I wanted. :-( This was the biggest bummer, so even though I liked this location MORE than the Golden Sound, I'm gonna have to bump them down a notch.

Fast is not one of them.I would imagine that they are making a fair amount of money when a cup of black coffee and bacon biscuit are around $13. So why on earth are they still using a post-it note system for all food and drinks?!?!? This is why the line is long, the girl at the front takes your food and drink order, then walks the post-it back to the kitchen and then over to the staff making drinks.... this happens each time someone orders!

However, I don't think it was worth the wait in line or wait at the table. I was almost done with my coffee before my biscuit came out.

From the branding- done by Isle Of Printing- to the decor & displays, to the staff, and, of course, to the food & drink- this refurbished mechanic shop, turned third wave multi-roaster, has everything a creative, coffee/food-lover could want. If I were local to Nashville, this would certainly be my home away from home!I stopped in twice the past couple days and took recommendations from baristas each visit:Day 1- Brock recommended the Oddly Correct Ethiopian Espresso & the Iced Bourbon Barrel Vanilla Latte (which I had w/ Almond Milk). _The Espresso is served w/ sparkling water & a house-made salted caramel- what a treat! A perfectly balanced presentation & an expertly-pulled extraction. _The Iced Bourbon Vanilla Latte is served perfectly sweet w/ proper, large ice cubes that ensure the integrity of the beverage for a good, long while! Day 2- Evan recommended the Verve Kenyan espresso & I ordered the Southern Frenchman sandwich on a GLUTEN-FREE biscuit- HALLELU! _The Southern Frenchman is a sweet/savory sandwich of egg, ham, swiss, paprika, & strawberry jam served on a perfectly executed gluten-free biscuit. In fact, if no one had told me that it was gluten-free, I would've had no idea!

I wanted this to be my new staple coffee shop. I've visited this location and the Golden Sound location 5 times now. Every time has been a let down. The coffee at Barista Parlor is simply not good. They brew too thin and use bitter beans. The employees are incredibly rude. Besides the many other negative reviews I've heard about Barista, a close friend had a very rude interaction with the manager, who asked her to never order her drink there again--because she asked for a little bit of almond milk in her coffee. I actually asked for non-dairy milk in my coffee the last time I went. I was laughed at, and obviously annoyed the employee, because he watched me pour it into the cup while shaking his head. So heads up: Don't ask for milk with your coffee--you'll be scowled at! Not to mention, $4-5 for a simple coffee? It better have magic in it, or make me fly, or contain gold, or do something extraordinary. Alas, it doesn't. It's a bitter coffee on a cool plank.

"519B Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Where do I begin with this one? :)I am a coffee fiend. I need coffee to function. There's lots of good and theres some bad involved with Barista Parlor. I will try my best to explain:The good: The coffee is absolutely delicious. Cold brewed techniques! Everything I have ate and drank here is great! I had a sausage biscuit sandwich with peach jam that melted in my mouth. And the coffee always feels good leeching in to my veins! Ok that was weird - but you know what I mean. The decor is awesome too. I love what they've done to the space. The bad: There is no visible menu until you get to the front where you order, so the problem with that is, you are forced to wait in line looking at the 100's of chocolates that they make from various ingredients (including wood! No I am not joking) that range in price from 6-8$ per chocolate bar. By the time you get to the front where you place your order, you then have the opportunity to look at the menu. So you of course, hold up the line yourself. Bad, and poor design. You wait. And wait, and wait. Hopefully you aren't in a hurry or planning on getting to work any time soon. The cost: A regular cup of coffee (not a prepared coffee, but just a coffee -that also takes just as long to make - costs 5$. The sausage biscuit costs 5$ I understand you can go to Carl's Jr. and get a 3$ sausage biscuit and the ingredients are going to be very poor quality. The quality of these is way better. And I still think its worth the price. Unfortunately I cannot really afford to come here as much as I want to. The good outweighs the bad in this case.

I have heard that it's considered one of the best in the nation...but better then that, my fabulously awesome hair stylist had recommended I stop by that very same day. Location: Barista Parlor is tucked away in the back of a shopping strip with boutique (no) choices like Rainbow fashions. It is right next door to Groove and Porter Road Butcher so you can use those as landmarks. The parlor is fenced off and has an amazing home made stage that you can imagine would make for the best live shows. There is some patio seating but I would say minimal... Parking is an interesting situation since you sort of have to drive through past the stage to get to the back. When you walk inside the parlor/garage you get a definite urban chic feel. They have pendant style exposed lighting hanging from the ceilings with walls full of coffee and coffee accessories. They carry the Aeropress...and for true coffee lovers.. you know. Coffee: It certainly takes a while to get your coffee, but its worth it. They have certain drip times that they follow and their method makes for the purest tasting coffee. Or so I am told. I rock out to pumpkin spice keurig, so yeah. A cup of coffee is going to run you $4. But like a lot of places in Nashville, the price is worth the ambience. Of note, I was seriously confused where their menu was... they carry two at the register...which of note...also took me a second to find. There is an enormous selection of packaged roasts on sale. However, they do not list prices. I was curious and asked and turns out the coffees run typically $16-22. Which is pricey...but it really is high quality coffee. AND ALSO for you (me) Keurig drinkers. We did an experiment the other day by dissecting out a keurig cup, weighing the contents and then doing some simple math.... y'all we are paying almost $30 a lb for coffee! Mind.

I really enjoyed my experience here and will definitely be back. It's not really ideal for studying given how loud the music is...and its not definitely a place to pick up your daily coffee given the price point.

"519B Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I am a huge espresso fan and know it is hard to find good espresso outside of Italy. I traveled to Italy at least once a year and it is almost impossible to get a bad cup of espresso, but anywhere else in the world it can be pretty tough to get a good one, but, if you search hard enough you are mostly able to find at least one place in a city that is able to make it properly. Also I am a hobby barista and have a lot of experience with Italian portafilter machines. So I heard about BP as probably the best coffee / espresso spot in town and was excited to check it out. First of all I was impressed by the design of the place and it all looked super professional at the first sight and I loved to see, that they have the slayer espresso machine with which you can make amazing espresso. So far, so good. The prices where shocking, especially for the simple espresso. $4 dollars for a cup of espresso and just 50ct more for a cappuccino. Normally the espresso should be more like closer to half the price of a cappuccino. I don't mind to pay for good quality, but also my expectations where pretty high and since a filtered cup of coffee was the same price and looked like one of their signature drinks, I started with that first. I took the ""handsome"". It looked also professional how they made it, but when I tried it, it is was quite disappointing, because it was one of the most sour tasting coffees I ever had and didn't taste good to me at all and I couldn't keep drinking it. So I thought I have to try the pure espresso since they have the slayer machine also. I ordered one of the two espresso bean choices and when it came I was already disappointed by how the crema looked. The color was a little too dark, but more important there was not much crema at all and it was too thin. The taste was horrible, it was really one of the worst espresso experiences that I ever had. It was so sour that it almost hurt my throat. I went back to the counter and explained why I cannot enjoy the espresso and the gentleman offered me to do another one with the other type of beans. It looked the same and tasted even worse, more sour. I just had two sips and couldn't finish it. A female associate came by and asked, if everything is ok now and I explained that I am really disappointed with the taste and wanted to explain why. She interrupted me and tried to explain me that they use a different machine (slayer) and darker roasted (Italian style) coffee beans, which I already was aware of. She was not interested in what I wanted to say and just gave me a little toffee as an apology. They did not offer me a refund or anything similar. She gave me the feeling, that I don't know anything about good coffee and that I think the coffee tastes so bad, because I have a bad taste and never had good coffee in my life. It really offended me and all in all I am very disappointed and had one of the worst customer experiences ever.

"519B Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I held out for a long time on Barista Parlor, but finally gave in recently.  My sister was visiting from out of town and I wanted her to see what a Nashville coffee shop looked like.  I'd heard so many people rave about the coffee, but had also heard you may wait a while.  Well, despite that knowledge I was completely unprepared for the wait.Upon our arrival, we took our places in the back of the line.  The line was probably 20 people at that point.  And we waited.  We talked and conversed and observed the hippest of all hipsters.  And we waited some more.  All while wondering where in the world the menus were and what was in the advertised drink of the day.  And we waited.  And where is that menu?We finally found out that there are only two menus.  One at the register and one that is passed back in the line.  But when someone holds onto that menu, you don't see if for a long time.  Which makes it a little difficult to know what in the world you're ordering.After at least 30 minutes in line, we finally reached the register.  We ordered drinks, bought an unpriced chocolate bar that turned out to be $8, and proceeded to wander in search of two seats (which was rather difficult given the large amount of open space and limited number of actual places to sit).  The space is great if you're just talking aesthetics, but it's not very functional or efficient.  Once we sat down, we waited some more.  And then some more.  With only a simple coffee and a hot chocolate, we didn't anticipate that it would take terribly long.  But it was another 15 or so minutes before our drinks finally came out.I can't say that we had a terrible experience with any of the baristas or staff (perhaps we didn't ask enough questions to get glares and rude responses), but they also were not overtly friendly.As for the drinks, I'll start with the good.  My sister seemed to really enjoy her coffee.  So at least given all of the waiting, they had created a decent product.  I think the coffee would probably get 4 stars.  My hot chocolate, however, was honestly one of the worst I've ever had.  I'm not certain there was chocolate in it.  My sister tasted it thinking I was crazy given that it was Olive and Sinclair, a very expensive and fancy hot chocolate.  She confirmed.  You could hardly taste cocoa.  Or sugar.  I actually ended up adding pieces of the chocolate bar we purchased as well as sugar to it on my own just to make it taste like something.  I would prefer gas station hot chocolate, or even lowly Swiss Miss, to what I had there.Maybe it was a bad day.  Maybe they just screwed up the drink.  But the wait of at least 45 minutes seems normal or even short for this place.  And that kind of wait for a sub-par product is certainly not worth it.  Is it trendy?  Sure.  But to me it seems like another place that hipsters go just to say they go there.  It's a place to see and be seen, a place to talk about, and a place to Instagram for likes.On the other hand, the biscuit sandwich DID look really good...but I would never pay that much for one.",Barista Parlor,6157129766.0,4.0,2014-11-20,"Nashville, TN",/biz/barista-parlor-nashville-6,1.0,329,"Washington, DC",Dan E.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.1622296,-86.774353,566.7091028370305,False,3096.0,3.662613981762918,3.75,3.660436137071651

If Amazon were to ever implode, would definitely come here to buy a backup Chemex and replenish the pre-apocalyptic bean reserve.Cons:-Took a little while to get my food. I was second in line upon walking in and guessed another 4 people were ahead of me for food. By the time the Waffle arrived, I had finished my coffee because it was getting cold. Not a huge con since this was the first cup of the day.-Only received a fork with the utencil set. Would have been nice to get a knife as well to cut the waffle and peaches. I sent a peach flying across the plate after trying to cut it with a knife. Not sure if there were knives elsewhere in the shop.-Slanted mini barstools surrounding the coffee bar were a tad uncomfortable. This could be understandable if the low bar had outlets and the stools were designed as a means to prevent Wifi squatters. No outlets though. Tl;dr: Great place to get an excellent cup of coffee and bite to eat in a creative environment.

"519B Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Hey! Are you looking for some coffee steeped in pretension? Have I got the place for you!Let's start with the obvious. You're not going to get your coffee quickly at this place. Though, a single glance at the long line of hipsters would have told you that. You'll probably spend about 20 min waiting to order. Maybe you can spend that time looking at a menu? Guess again, hotshot! Hipsters don't need menus! You'll find one, that's right, ONE, framed at the cash register. Even then, when you finally see the menu, none if it will make sense. There's a bunch of  v + number business that somehow refers to the method by which the coffee is freshly brewed. If you stare too long at the menu, the barista will doubt your authenticity, so just quickly order whatever the person in front of you had.When I say the barista will doubt your authenticity as a coffee drinker, what I mean is that this is inevitable so you should just prepare yourself to feel like an idiot. I ordered a cup of freshly brewed coffee and requested some almond milk to go with it. Do they have almond milk? Of course. Will they put it in your coffee? HELL NO. That might spoil the pure and heavenly black elixir that they have painstakingly brewed for your exclusive admiration. The barista eventually agreed to give me a cup of almond milk on the side, that I might add to my coffee, but only after making me promise, out loud, to taste the coffee without it. This really happened.Of course, after the 20 min in line, you'll spend 20 min waiting for your coffee and food, so your total minimum time in the barista parlor is 40 min, guaranteed. Food is upscale and good, though slightly overpriced. An acceptably tasty biscuit with fancy meats, etc. The coffee is obviously perfect. How could it not be? But you'll find it difficult to relax amidst the massive amount of douchery.The real product on display at this place is not the coffee, it's the baristas. The whole operation seems geared towards making you marvel at these hip baristas wearing their leather aprons and making coffee with their willy wonka coffee contraptions. Can you get a delicious cup of coffee at the barista parlor? Absolutely.

"519B Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I'm writing and posting this review from Barista Parlor, rather than actually doing work, because, like, work and stuff. Anyway, I'm really impressed.This places oozes of awesome ambience. From the garage doors to the mosaic tile to the aged wood to the baristas wearing early 20th century attire, the word to describe it is ""neat."" Even the lighting has that old-timer feel, which is a refreshing and relaxing change compared to the fluorescent or over-modernized incandescent stuff you see in most shops. In short, it's the kind of place you'd expect to find in East Nashville.As for my whiskey caramel iced coffee, the presentation matches the motif. Served in a Mason jar, I secretly wished that it might contain moonshine. No dice. The flavor was pretty good, although it took about 10 minutes to get it. I'd already eaten, else I would have scarfed down some of the pretty decent looking food I saw others eating. Well, probably not THEIR food, because that would be rude, but you get the idea.There are a few power outlets scattered around, and that seems to be enough for a slow day where at most a third of us are poking away on our laptops. It might be problematic if it were a busier afternoon.It's a pretty eclectic mix of people. You have your usual flannel-wearing East Nash hipsters, of course, but folks in dress slacks have come in too. And if you're wondering whether there are pretty people, the answer is yeah. Speaking of, to the guy next to me, Zach Morris called and wants his hair back.Areas to improve? First, as others have mentioned, parking's a bit rough. Despite it not being crowded, there was only one space left in the back. Also, the music should get cranked down a couple notches.

"519B Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I'd heard and read good things about the place, so we went on Saturday morning for coffee and breakfast. First, I asked if there were menus, and a barista said there were a couple at the register. I asked at the register if we could look at one while in line, and was told no, these are the only two and you look at them when you're at the front. Waited in the long line, and when it was our turn, I asked what decaf coffee they had. You'd have thought I was asking for a soda or something. I asked why they didn't have any, and she informed me they had not found any that they felt were good enough. Interesting, since other higher-end places like 8th and Roast have. Plus good establishments like Fido (bongo java), frothy monkey, the Well, etc. Totally disappointed, I looked at the food menu. She asked if we needed a minute and she'd take someone else's order. Um, no, I waited on everyone in front of me to decide, so surely 60 seconds won't kill the process while you wait on me to pick something. All that said, our breakfast biscuits were amazingly good.

"519B Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"It's unfortunate that this coffee shop is suffering bad reviews from people who don't know how to appreciate a place like this. Most of the negative reviews I'm reading are purely based on people not knowing the difference between Starbucks and a one-of-a-kind boutique coffee shop that serves incredibly high-quality coffee. You wouldn't dare go to a five-star restaurant and ask the chef to hold three ingredients and add two you prefer. You wouldn't complain about there being three forks and not knowing which to use. You certainly wouldn't complain about the portion sizes on a four course meal. Why? Because this isn't Golden Corral. You don't smother your french fries in a sea of ketchup and pay $9 for all you can eat ribs. That might be what you are used to, but that doesn't mean all restaraunts operate in that fashion. Barista Parlor is unique in that it's offering the best espresso/coffee beans from around the country. If you go to Stumptown in Seattle, you get their amazing roasters serving up their coffee. If you find yourself at Blue Bottle or Sightglass in San Francisco, it's the same high-caliber baristas pulling decadent shots and truly crafting your drink using their product. Barista Parlor stocks the best beans from all of these places and lays them out for your choosing. Ok, ok... I guess it is a little like Golden Corral... but more like if the best chefs in the world were preparing the food. None the less, people should expect to pay a little more for renowned espresso being pulled through a thirty-thousand dollar machine. You should pay a little more for craft and precision. It's not even that much more expensive. A cappuccino at Starbucks would run me $3.10. I payed a whopping $1 more at Barista Parlor for a cappucino that supremely destroys Starbucks. Which brings me to my last point...If you don't LOVE the taste of GREAT coffee. DO NOT COME HERE! If you are absolutely fine with the ""Super Dark Roast Arabica Robusto Blend"" they serve at Thornton's gas stations, then you should totally go save some money and get your caffeine fix. However, if you want to taste coffee in ways you've never imagined, using methods you've likely never seen, in an environment that's truly it's own... you MUST visit this place!  I've traveled all over the country to some of the best coffee shops, and this one is in my top five.

The environment was beautifully decorated, trendy and typically ""hipster"", which we can both appreciate.  Upon walking in there was a short wait and a small menu, only one menu, to order from. My husband ordered one of their three biscuit choices (8 dollars ), there were no vegetarian options for me except for pastries, so I had a macaroon.... When asked about a simple egg they said they cooked those in lard (FYI not vegetarian). Still, I was a good sport and felt optimistic. My husband was delivered his crumbly, over salted biscuit on a plate the size of a drink coaster. Our 5 dollar coffees arrived 10 minutes later. We were informed cream and sugar were on the opposite side of the building, after the long trek we found there to be no creamer. At this point, my optimism was gone. Ridiculous to have to walk across a room and serve myself after paying an ungodly amount of money. When your food is delivered and drinks why after the delivery is it necessary for the customer to seek out cream and sugar? My husband felt he was a part of a circus act trying to eat his crumbling biscuit and catch the falling pieces on his tiny, bottled cap sized plate.

"519B Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"OH, OK. I GET IT. Barista Parlor is a super-awesome-crazy-cool hipster hangout. It uses an espresso machine that cost more than my car (when it was new), cranks out indie tunes, has what I assume are reclaimed wood tables, hangs artisan lightbulbs, and features a huge pixelated mural of a boat at sea. On top of that, the employees are all dressed in clothes/aprons from Nashville's hottest homegrown designers.  This has resulted in the place being featured in the NY times and countless other publications (both local and national). If this place had booze to go along with the caffeine, internet, and sparse food menu (which is admittedly delicious), it would be a one stop hipster shop.Now, please don't be discouraged by all of the hipster-dad chestpieces you see when you walk in here. Just embrace it! I've always subscribed to the ""hipsters create cool things"" credo, and despite the fact that my rant above suggests otherwise, I think this place has some good stuff to offer. The décor, although maybe a bit contrived, is pretty damn cool. The coffee is good and crafted with care. The PRB sausage biscuit with peach preserves is fantastic. And, the selection of artisan chocolates (including Mast Brothers from Brooklyn) is very good.I suppose my only complaint is with the pricing/sizing structure. I've gotten the bourbon and vanilla latte two times. The first time, I got it there. I got the bigger size, which was either $5 or $6 (a little pricey to begin with), but it came in one of those big, wide latte mugs. It was delicious. The second time, I got it to go. I got the smaller size, which is only $1 less if I remember correctly, and it basically came in one of those 2 oz. Dixie cups my parents keep in their bathroom.

"519B Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Two out of two for the coffee. It's awesome. Really. They don't locally source beans or roast in house, but they get great coffee. Stumptown and such. Employees are nice for the most part, but some treat you with a little bit of a too cool attitude / coffee snobbery. I used to work in a coffee shop that roasted in house and was very serious about coffee. I learned a lot there. One time I came to Barista Parlor and ordered an americano. The girl said ""sorry, we can't make americanos."" What? I was confused. ""Why not"" I asked. Her actual response was ""it compromises the integrity of the bean."" Well shit. Then she tried to make a case that their espresso machine is super high end and special and isn't capable of making americanos. Does it make espresso? Do you have hot water? Yes and Yes. Can I get them together in one cup? No. That's crazy to refuse to make a customer something they way they would like and explain it to them in a way that tells them ""you do it wrong, moron."" Anyway I didn't argue. It's just the way it was put. You should make what your customer asks for (unless it's a coffee milkshake or something like that). The other thing is that it can take up to 30 minutes to get a coffee. That's a real time I waited for a shot of espresso. They are slow and not just because of the V60 and Chemex brewing methods. Once I ordered an iced tea. They had the stuff pre made in their fridge. They mindlessly put the ticket in line and proceeded to make 2 Chemex brewed coffees which took over ten minutes. Then they made my iced tea in 10 seconds. (hint: that's not the efficient way to do that). There was also another employee walking around the counter doing little tidying tasks. They could have poured the iced tea, but they didn't. So, they could improve their timing, but I think they want it to be slow to make a point. I think that's actually their business model.I'll give them this, the last time I went in it was more pleasant. But you still have to wait for a long time for a coffee or espresso shot or whatever you order. Sometimes I want to go get a coffee from there, but I don't know how long I'll be waiting or what the employees will be like so I skip it and go to bongo java.

Boy am I glad I did! This gets 4 stars only because it was hard to find since there's no signage that's obvious or visible from Gallatin Avenue unless you're creeping along. Another reason is because, once you're there, you don't really know what your options are for coffee. It's not a huge problem, not a big deal at all and I have no qualms mostly because I am a coffee nerd and I don't need too terribly much instruction and I am not afraid to ask. However, some people want to know what they're getting right off the bat and hate asking questions and this may, on the first visit, be a tiny turn-off.Owner Andy Mumma is a coffee craftsman and he did say in an interview that he intended this to be the speakeasy of coffee shops. That may seem pretentious to some but one man's pretentiousness is this girl's gain - more good coffee for me!Food wise, their kitchen closes at noon so take that into consideration if you're planning to eat. The waffles are good - I ordered mine with a side of Porter Road Butcher sausage. The pastries are also made locally, and if you're on the go, grab a bar of chocolate to have with your coffee! They serve and sell coffee from good roasteries like Intelligentsia, Coava and Mad Cap and I highly recommend ordering the Intelligentsia brewed with the Hario V60 either hot or over ice. Honestly, just try it all. Sit and watch them brew your coffee, ask questions (the people who own it and the staff are SO nice, so friendly and ready to help you learn more about coffee) and treat yourself to some lovely brews. Pourover coffee is heavenly to drink. With the consistency of tea, it's smooth and goes down easily without any bitterness or too much acidity. So if you're looking for mud, stick to some of the older, local coffee places or Starbucks. If you're looking for delicious coffee (made right) and yummy food, go to Barista Parlor.",Barista Parlor,6157129766.0,6.0,2012-05-29,"Nashville, TN",/biz/barista-parlor-nashville-6,4.0,329,"Washington, DC",Tabitha T.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.1622296,-86.774353,566.7091028370305,False,2041.0,3.662613981762918,3.75,3.660436137071651

"519B Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I debated about how many stars to give Barista Parlor.  It isn't trying to be a pop-in, pop-out coffee house.  This is not where you go because you just need some caffeine to become human again and you would be happy licking the coffee rings off of your morning paper.  This place isn't about getting from point A to point B for your coffee, it is about the love of coffee.  If you just want a cup of coffee on your way home or out, or you normally drink Folgers at home, this place isn't for you.  So what is Barista Parlor trying to be?  It is trying to be artisan coffee and food.  Each cup of coffee is like a baby for them.  They nurture it and take care of it and each is unique.  It is no coincidence that they wear Imogene + Willie jeans.  This is the Napa Valley of coffee, not the Two Buck Chuck.  So rather than judging them based on what I think a coffee house should be, I will judge them by how well they achieved their goal.  This is why they get 4 stars--they are a pretty good example of what they set out to be.  The coffee is amazing and expensive if you were expecting the $1.95 five-hour-old mediocre stuff from Starbucks.  But I am willing to pay their prices when I want a delicious, intriguing,  and complex, much like a big cab wine from Napa.  Because they make each cup individually (ensuring freshness and quality) it takes a little longer.  Again, you want fast and cheap, go to a gas station.  There is no splenda or nutrasweet or anything like that.  Whatever, I don't really mind.  Just like there aren't french fries paired with a Napa red when you go for a tasting.  I don't care.  Once packet of sugar has like 20 calories so we can all chill and enjoy something real for once.  I had one of their breakfast sandwiches with local eggs, local Provence bread, PRB sausage made next door and local artisan cheese.  It was delicious.  Yes, it was a little too pricey, but if I wanted a cheap breakfast sandwich with ingredients that come from who-knows-where Factory and the Sysco truck, I could go to Nashville Biscuit House (which I also love, but is a different experience.)  They would get 5 stars from me if the breakfast sandwich was $6 instead of $8 (with the sausage.)  My coffee was great.  I had a drip style cup because that is what my husband prefers and he did the ordering.  Next time I will try an espresso.  I had the Coava that they were offering that day and it was really tasty.  I savored it slowly as I ate my sandwich.  I really dig the interior and the exterior.  Bold colors on the outside and a loft-y/garage-y feel on the inside.  It feels like a reclaimed motorcycle repair shop, which may be exactly what it is.  It oozes modern hipster cool.  There is a lot to look at and I liked the seating a lot.  Uncluttered and comfortable. We took our 5 month old and there were some other kids as well.  There were plenty of kidless, well-dressed hipsters and we all coexisted quite pleasantly.  One note of suggestion for Barista Parlor: some kind of board with the day's offering would be great so that while you are waiting in line you can be thinking about your order.  We had to wait until we were at the register to even look at the food and coffee selections and I felt rushed since there were a few people in line behind us.  Either that or print out you offerings and put some copies on clipboards along the line.  We will definitely be going back (since it is only a 5 minute walk from our house) but we may have to limit it to a once a week treat.",Barista Parlor,6157129766.0,28.0,2012-06-13,"Nashville, TN",/biz/barista-parlor-nashville-6,4.0,329,"Washington, DC",Meg G.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.1622296,-86.774353,566.7091028370305,False,3551.0,3.662613981762918,3.75,3.660436137071651

At first it was tricky to find because it's tucked away behind a clothing shop off Gallatin Road with the same address in the Inglewood/East Nashville area. They have converted an old garage and turned it into the ultimate place of cool including playing vinyl records and using reclaimed wood and local ingredients. The coffee is awesome (my daughters claims) - the hot chocolate is very good, but not sweet. This is not the kind of place you should take small kids - nothing for them to drink. The owners must not read the Yelp reviews about service and suggestions or they would have listened to our same issues over a year later. When we first went in, we didn't know if we were to sit down or walk to the cash register on the side of large dining room - no one greeted us and the small staff of 3 was busy making coffee for the full house. They need a sign at the front with an arrow pointing to ""Order Here"" and a menu of the day written out or printed. You do indeed go to the cash register (they need 2 cashiers) and order from a small wooden menu (they have 2 in the whole place I think) - very inefficient.

"519B Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I recently started drinking caffeine in my coffee again, after two years of sticking with decaf. It was a tough decision - I don't like being a slave to my addiction, but the coffee choices are broader and the Alzheimer's studies are compelling, so here I am. Conveniently, that makes Barista Parlor a perfect place for me now. I am exactly the type of coffee drinker they cater to - obsessed with high quality, recently roasted beans prepared with good single-cup brewing methods. And so, I will be going to Barista Parlor regularly, because they serve me very, very well. And the food menu with all locally-sourced components is exquisite - expensive, but worth every penny.So why 3 stars? 3 reasons.1) They don't have any locally roasted coffee choices. Now, I know that our local roasters are not necessarily all great, but I've tasted nearly every coffee from Roast, Inc. and certainly think at least one or two of them could compete with the coffees Barista Parlor serves. They support (and allow their customers to support) local businesses with their food menu and chocoloate options (despite the fact that Olive and Sinclair is really not quite up to the standard of their other chocolates), so why not offer at least one local option?2) No decaf. When Barista Parlor was about to open, I had a conversation with the owner about this - basically, it was pretty clear from his demeanor that he thinks decaf coffees can't possibly compete with caffeinated coffees. He is wrong. Counter Culture, Coava, Intelligentsia, and, yes, Roast Inc. all sell decaffeinated coffees that are just as delicious, complex, and expensive as the coffees Barista parlor currently sells. Some of them are even single-origin, though admittedly blends are more common. Even if he tastes them all and disagrees (and I'm certain he hasn't), why not at least offer a decaf espresso? I promise, whatever quality difference his discerning palate can find will be drowned out by the milk and sugar in a latte, and preparation is 90% of a good espresso anyway. Now that they are open later, this seems like even more of a problem - I would love a cup of coffee at 4 pm, but I can't drink caffeine that late if I want to sleep. I'm sure I'm not alone. 3) Demeanor. Okay, you don't want to offer decaf, soy milk, or Splenda - fine. I think you're nuts - personally, I only drink coffee black, but I still wouldn't open a coffee shop without milk or sugar out of some weird desire to bring people around to my opinion, because I respect others' opinions - but it's your business. Find a way to stand by your decisions without making your customers feel like yokels. If they're talking to you about your decisions, it means they want your product - well-prepared, high quality coffee - and are willing to pay the justifiably exorbitant prices to do so. Treat them like crap, and they're very likely never to return.",Barista Parlor,6157129766.0,25.0,2012-06-17,"Nashville, TN",/biz/barista-parlor-nashville-6,3.0,329,"Washington, DC",David G.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.1622296,-86.774353,566.7091028370305,False,2889.0,3.662613981762918,3.75,3.660436137071651

Now in some cities this would not be at all remarkable, in New York and Chicago this is no big deal, but in a town where meatless Chinese food is limited to veggie eggrolls and the occasionally well-prepared Homestyle Bean Curd (China Spring does both of these pretty well) this is remarkable.This is a new menu item for the 'Spring and the first time I ordered it, it was so-so--the tofu was kind-of hard, the sauce too sweet and not at all spicy. I almost didn't order it again, but I am so very glad I did!Since my last visit they have perfected this dish. I asked for it extra spicy and it came out just right.

I opened up yelp to see if I could try any new pizza places. I've heard of Fox Dens before but never had it. I check their website & saw a ""today's special"" for one large topping pizza for $7.99. I figured that would be something good to try. I called & ordered a pepperoni pizza. The pizza would be ready in 10-15 minutes. I made my way over after work. This location is located off Elm Hill Pike in a strip mall. I've passed by this strip mall a million times but never noticed Fox Dens in it. I pulled up & walked inside. The shop is small, a couple tables are inside if you'd like to eat there. The woman didn't ask for my name over the phone, but it was 5:30 & I guess they didn't get a lot of call in ordered because she knew the pepperoni pizza was mine. I also noticed that they had a 100 score from the health department. That always makes me feel good. My total was $8.74 & I was on my way. The weight of the pizza seemed a little light to me for a large. The box was big though. I waited to look at it when I got home. I opened the box and noticed how big it was. I'm not sure if the inchage (is that a word?) but they cut the large into ten pieces. I like that. It also makes me feel like a fatty because I ate 5 slices. I thought the pepperoni pizza was great for the $7.99 price. The crust and bottom had the right amount of crisp to it. I liked how the cheese was cooked golden brown. The amount of pepperoni was good, however I thought the amount of cheese was a little spare. Maybe next time I'll order with extra cheese. Was it the best ever?

Honestly, since Clarksville has nothing even close to Thai food, it's a must when you're driving to, from or through Nashville and i yelped it and we went on our way. I was a little confused at the service of the restaurant because you order at the counter, then go sit down and they bring it to you. I was feeling a little frisky and wanted to try something new (other than the Pad Thai) and when we were in DC, my boyfriend had come across an interesting dish called ""Crispy Basil Beef"" and it was... the best thing we'd ever tasted. Sadly, they did not have Crispy Beef but they did have Crispy Basil Chicken and i got the Panag Curry. The food comes out in paper plates, which, oddly enough is the smartest thing i've seen a restaurant do. The prices are not expensive and honestly the food speaks for itself. When you know how to make Thai Food, you can pretty much serve it on a banana leaf and it'll taste amazing - which it was. The panang curry was delicious and perfect seasoned.

The tom ka kai soup had separated somehow & I only took a bite or two before giving up on it because it just tasted yucky. The chicken satay was good but not great.

"17 White Bridge RoadNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Well this was a horrible dining experience.When we walked in, we were seated immediately, then promptly forgotten about for nearly 15 minutes. Not even so much as a ""Hi, I'm your server"" or a glass of water. When our ""server"" did finally emerge from the depths of the back of the restaurant, he came out trying to be funny when a plate was dropped and broken in another room stating ""That's not coming out of my paycheck!"" - How professional.When we finally did get to put in our drink orders and appetizer, we hoped the night would turn around. Each time the guy came to our table, then disappeared, it seemed like he stayed in the back longer and longer each time. It took forever to get water, and even longer to get the drinks we ordered from the bar. Not only were we amazed to actually see our server in the 3 times he actually came to the table, but to top things off, he never put in the order for the cheese wedges we'd asked for at the very beginning. He came back and claimed, ""Sorry, I forgot."" Let me add to this by saying the restaurant was dead. We were one of this champ's only 2 tables.When I say he kept disappearing, I mean he was absent from our table and the only section he was serving, not that I couldn't see him. I was positioned at our table to be able to see directly to the kitchen door and the small area the servers had to make drinks for customers. It seemed many of the wait staff liked to hang out in this little room, playing on their phones and laughing and cutting up with each other. While I don't have a problem with that behavior in general, if you aren't doing your job, then more attention needs to be paid to the customers. I had to physically wave and get someone's attention each time our table needed something. This is not my job. Pay attention to your paying guests!With the exception of the potato soup, all the food was bland, unseasoned, and tasteless. Nothing we'd ever return for. Then, to top it all off, when it was time to check out and leave, our guy was again M.I.A. We finally flagged down someone and asked for our check. The guy came sauntering back and we gave him our 20% off coupon to have it applied to the bill when returned. Naturally, it arrived at the table quite some time later not only WITHOUT the 20% off, but we were charged full price on our appetizer when we'd arrived during the happy hour specials. Of course it took a while to get this fixed, then we finally were able to verify our bill and attempt to pay.By attempt, I mean this cat disappeared with my credit card, and it was over 10 minutes before I even saw him again. When he did poke his head out of the little drink station area, he came back and served the table behind us (without giving me my card back), then had the audacity to walk away AGAIN without returning our bill! After another 5 minutes or so I actually saw the dude sit down at a table and start chatting with other waitstaff (IN the dining area, no less). At this point, our entire table stood up and walked towards the front door. I had to ask 3 different members of the staff for my card back as we'd waited long enough and it was time to leave. Everyone, including our server, seemed shocked that we were ready to go. We'd been waiting far too long. When it's time to pay, take the check and the card, process the charges, and return immediately so you can turn over the table and serve more guests. This is common restaurant service, not rocket science.We will not be returning to this location again based on the service alone, and will be less inclined to visit another O'Charley's any time soon should the food continue the downhill trend it is on now.Side note: We only saw a ""manager"" once, and by saw I mean he poked his head out of the kitchen for two seconds and stood by the drink station, then promptly returned to the back.

Toasted ciabatta bread, grilled chicken really heavy on the pepper, Parmesan and Bleu cheese, tomato, lettuce, applewood smoked bacon, and mayo (I hold the mayo, that stuff is gross y'all).  The grilled chicken was really peppery and somehow it gave me a major allergy attack with sneezes, runny nose, and then stuffiness all without adding any heat.  Weird.  But it tasted good.  The bleu cheese was non-existent. Bacon was good but could have used more.  Overall an underwhelming sandwich that had the potential to be awesome.  Fries - despite them not being skinny, they were adequately crunchy so I liked them.Ketchup - ""made for O'Charley's"" - actually has a bit different flavor than other ketchup.

We ordered some sushi and finally received our drink order. I asked for a straw for my water and again felt she was annoyed she had to make another stop at our table.

"505 12th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Came here today for an early lunch since my friend had a half off depot certificate. Ended up getting the buffet and also trying the mochi cake dessert and vanilla ice cream. So the place looks much more like a bar than sushi place, but it seems like it would really double as both during the night, which I'm sure works pretty well for the area. That being said, lets get to the sushi.I tried mostly all of the sushi I saw available except the ones that had a lot of avocado, and they changed out like 5 dishes when I was there (it was like noon so they'd been open about  an hour). Now let me start out by saying I love fried food, so the friend sushi is the kind I like best. That being said, I also feel like it's really an americanized version of sushi, done just so american get over the whole ""raw food"" deal. Either way, I think it's great to offer fried sushi, either with the rice fried around or just the inside fried a bit, since it adds variety. Mostly I think the sushi tasted pretty ok, but nothing really stood out as ""amazing"" to me, you know? If I didn't like the fried sushi so much, I might have given this place a 2 instead I imagine. Meanwhile, the mochi cake dessert was pretty delicious, although it literally had no ice cream despite saying that it did in the menu.... and it seemed a bit overpriced for the quantity provided (5.75).

THE PROS: Very big menu with a lot of variety. I usually always order the Crunchy Mui Bueno, Tuna Tempura, and Sea Bass Yakitori. I love the sauce that comes w/ the tempura, and the Sea Bass Yakitori is sooooo delicious it melts in your mouth! I LOVE techno music so the music that is always blaring is super fine with me! The fried ice cream is also to die for! Whatever you do, DON""T forget to order the plum sake! It is served warm and it gives you the best warm, fuzzy feeling ever! (if you drink enough! lol) It's usually pretty lively in there which is also fine with me because I prefer to ALWAYS feel like I'm at a party. THE CONS: Although the food is USUALLY good, I have experienced times where the sea bass yakitori is TINY and the rolls are so huge you can't eat them in one bite. And for anyone who eats sushi rolls you know having to bite into one pretty much makes it fall apart. I've never had anything that actually TASTED bad, though. I have experienced waiters at times who take forever, forget you, and leave your food on the counter 10 min before they bring it to you.

"505 12th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Stopped in yesterday for lunch. Very busy at 1:00; I grabbed a seat at the bar, but wasn't there for the lunch buffet, though apparently most everyone else was. There appeared to be 2 servers and one host available for the entire restaurant, which was quite crowded, but not to capacity. I started with a spinach appetizer while I took my time to peruse the menu. When the server finally returned, I asked for an order of Toro and an order of Uni; she'd told me she'd have to see if they had any. She returned quickly, only to to advise no, they had neither. She said they were ""seasonal."" OK, then maybe that could be noted on the menu??? I didn't care for the spinach appetizer; the long thick stems were attached (big ones, we're not talking baby spinach) and I could handle that, but didn't at all care for the sickly sweet sauce that was pared with it. I was expecting more of a peanut sauce, shame on me for not knowing the difference. I are less than half of the spinach go-ame appetizer.   Perusing the menu was a chore, since MANY of the rolls are either deep fried or contain fried items. I typically don't like anything in my rolls to be fried, so at least half the the menu items would be off the list. I ordered a spicy tuna hand roll next. There were three pieces of nigiri tuna within the roll, with a splat of very tasty spicy sauce on top. Also included was a slice of avocado and some cucumber. Sadly, the rice was not evenly distributed on the nori, so literally the bottom 1 & 1/2 "" of the cone were empty -  just the nori. Most times when I've had spicy tuna the tuna is chopped and mixed with the sauce, but not always. Served this way, it was much harder to evenly distribute the spicy sauce to all the bites. Some were very spicy, some not at all. I unwrapped the roll to try and re-distribute the rice and sauce and was a little more successful, but feel it's a shame I should have to do this with a $5 hand roll. Really? You can't even put the rice to the bottom of the nori??  I then ordered,against my typical preference,  a roll with tempura shrimp & avocado. It was tasty, but the pieces were very very large. I ate half of that, as I mentioned that fried anything in rolls really isn't my style. Finally,  finished with a sunset something-or-other roll. That one was the best, fresh salmon and tuna in very nice portions inside, and the finished that happily. The server was adequate, given how many patrons she had to cater to, though my water was completely empty and I had to flag her down for a refill. However, when seated at the sushi bar, I was forced to look at the dirty restaurant equipment, with the back stainless wall caked in splattered grease. The health food score in front showed the restaurant received a respectable 89, but I cannot see how based on what I saw yesterday. The floors are worn, servers overworked, and menu advertises items they do not carry. I've been to more than 30 sushi restaurants in and around Nashville and the immediate area.

"505 12th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"After reading many of the reviews, the lower stars really seem to be attributed to the buffet. Realistically, I have a hard time judging a restaurant by a lunch buffet, and I seldom encounter a ""good"" sushi buffet. This is sushi that is placed en masse on a line with an attempt to keep it fresh while it is exposed to the open air.I have been to Ru San's at least 5-6 times in the intervening years, and I have always had a pleasant experience. The sushi doesn't taste ""fishy"" which to me is indicative of bad fish. Yes, the menu is very extensive, but I will admit to loving very simple sushi. Their basic rolls contain a great deal of flavor. Admittedly, if you are a purist, you will HATE Ru San's. The restaurant blares a lot of music that one reviewer likened to DDR soundtracks. Ru San's is not an intimate setting. It is where you go for food as part of a night out on the town. I happen to love the up-tempo music, but it's not for everyone. Ru San's is a fusion restaurant so they have a wide assortment of sushi that is not fish-based. Their ginger simmered beef maki is delicious, but most would not consider anything with beef in it sushi. Their vegetable-based maki is also quite tasty. As I said, if you are a purist, you may very well find a visit to Ru San's disappointing or downright dreadful.I think my biggest criticism is a lack of updating. I first visited Ru San's in 2003, and as of last night's visit, 04/13/2012, I cannot notice any real updates. The seating is worn, and many of the booths have some jagged places where the faux-leather is cracked and broken.Their sake is fine, but you should seriously try the unfiltered sake. This will appear milky instead of the normal clear sake. This is served at room temperature which is indicative of its quality since sake is warmed to obscure its impurities. I have tried their pork katsu dan which I absolutely love so I would recommend branching off of their sushi menu. There will be hit or misses, but the same holds true for all restaurants. An appetizer not listed on their menu is the teriyaki rice ball. The rice is crisp on the outside with a teriyaki sauce over the top and served on a bed of carrot shavings. It used to be just $0.75, and I am sure the price has increased although I doubt it has increased dramatically. I did not read over the price tab last night since my partner had the check.It is very easy to run up a huge tab here, though, when you start adding in sake and non-sushi food items.

"505 12th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"I think I only need to say this: I've thrown up on THREE separate occasions after eating the sushi at Ru San's. I'm to blame for going back after the first time. However, I'd like to describe an altercation I had with one of the owners when I simply wanted him to take a single item off our ticket that was not prepared correctly and because our fish was old and rubbery.My girlfriend and I ordered dinner: 2 sushi entrees and a handful of a la cart items. She'd ordered the ""Godzilla Roll"" - something that I had ordered every time I'd dinned here, probably totaling 15 visits over 2 years. My favorite roll, it's comprised of red snapper and macadamia nuts rolled in rice, flash fried and covered w/ a spicy aioli, then baked. I was very familiar with the food's preparation and character. My g'friend consumed ONE piece of the 5 presented on the plate, followed by some of the a la cart items. She put the 2nd roll into her mouth and started chewing, but abruptly spit it out into her napkin. The fish was rubbery, like calamari. She asked me to check it out. One look at the dish and I could tell it hadn't been prepared correctly. No flash frying and no baking - therefore not prepared as advertised, and the raw fish was old and chewy. All in all, she ate one piece, spit the other in her napkin and I sample 1/2 of a 3rd.  That's 2 1/2 pieces of the 5 on the plate (this comes into play in a second). The saba nigiri (salmon) was also not at all fresh - she had to pick it up with her hand and stretch and pull on it to rip it with her teeth. Being very disappointed in the dish, I notified the server that we would like to request that he take that single item off our ticket ($8.95). He refused, saying that if we ate more than 1/2 of the dish that they do not offer refunds. After an exchange with him, I asked to see the manager on duty who in this case happened to be a part owner of the restaurant. He was very rude and matter of fact in pointing out that, clearly marked on their menus, is a return policy stating that if you ate more than half your dish, you could not get a refund. To avoid a heated exchange, I paid for the item. After paying, I checked the menu for the refund policy. Nowhere on the menus is this information he quoted printed - as a matter of fact, refunds are ONLY available for food that is NOT PREPARED CORRECTLY. Also, we touched exactly 1/2 and not more (if we want to go with a technicality).Upon leaving, I approached the owner and took issue with his claimed refund policy on the menu. I asked him why he lied to me - He replied with ""We give NO refunds, no matter WHAT,"" thus contradicting even what WAS printed on their menu. Later that evening my girlfriend got sick from the food she ate. I ended up contesting the charge w/ American Express and had our total ticket refunded to me ($70)In a nutshell - rotten food, rotten people, rotten restaurant.",RuSan’s Sushi and Seafood,6152528787.0,6.0,2010-06-15,"Hendersonville, TN",/biz/rusans-sushi-and-seafood-nashville,1.0,190,"Washington, DC",Marc E.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.304773499999996,-86.6199957,555.0334180034542,False,2898.0,2.8473684210526318,1.3333333333333333,2.871657754010695

I am from a Coastal state, and I realize Nashville is not, so you can only expect so much from their sushi joints. I digress....Ru-San's is ok. The wait staff is mediocre at best, I think it's because they can't hear any thing you are saying over the ridiculously loud and obnoxious music they play constantly! I was SO annoyed the entire time I was there it was frustrating to order, and frustrating to attempt a conversation. I returned another night and we sat way in the back - mainly because we have kids and they apparently dont ""do"" the kid thing.

Shameless amounts of amped up techno are blaring out of every speaker. Now I may be getting old, but I am young enough to know that straight-up techno went ""out"" about 15-20 years ago.

So, if you are looking to dance with some glow sticks in fat pants, while being stared at by clueless rich kids, trusifarians, backward hat frat boys with body space issues, flip-collared douche bags, girls in their teens with breast enlargements, and overall dumb asses like me, Ru San's will blow your mind.Proof of shameless techno.From Rusan's website:""RU San's Japanese Sushi and Seafood Japanese Restaurant is a very '""in""' place to hang out and have drinks and sushi.

My roll that promised spicy aioli on top was lacking the aioli, and I had to ask for it on the side. There were no dishes for soy sauce on the table either. We split the check up between 4 people, and I was the only one to put down a credit card. The waitress came back, gave me back my card and my receipt, so I added my tip and we proceeded to leave. Moments later, the waitress is running down the street after me, proclaiming that she never did run my credit card. What? None of this compares with what happened when I actually got home from the restaurant. The last time I went, I did get mildly sick following my meal there, but it was nothing like last night.

"410 Metroplex DrNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"I haven't  been to a Japanese hibachi restaurant since I moved from Nashville over 11 years ago.  Thus when I heard there was going to be a birthday party at Mikado I was kind of excited since it has been so long.We were seated in a private dining room that had two grills in the middle and seats all the way around.  We only had one chef though because our party didn't quite go all the way around the second grill.  No problem though.The way these places work is like this: choose your meat (steak, chicken, shrimp, combos of the above, or seafood mix) and get ready for food overload.  Each meal comes with a soup, salad (with that awesome Asian sauce on it), fried rice, meat, two pieces of shrimp as appetizer, veggies (broccoli, carrots, onions, Japanese cabbage?), and a small dessert.  All one price, somewhere around $25-35.So then the chef comes out and does all his tricks.  Flames!  Funny jokes!  ""Birthday candle"" made out of a stack of onions!  Etc and so forth.  The more you interact the more they perform I think.  We were too busy talking so he kind of stopped trying to impress after a while.  Then, when your meat selection is done, he puts it on your plate.  How was it?  Soup - ok, nothing special.  Salad - fresh and I love that dressing!  Veggies were so good.  Chicken - wasn't a big fan or maybe was too stuffed by then.  Steak - he cooked it somewhat medium rare (more like medium) but it was my favorite and I ate all of it (explains why the chicken was not interesting me).  Fried rice was great since it includes all that butter and also fried eggs.  Yum!Drinks: everyone loves the Mikado special.  I tried one - it is a mix of rum, amaretto, southern comfort, and other stuff.  Tasted pretty orangey and very sweet but was deceptively potent.  After that sweet drink I ordered a dirty martini and let's just say...stick with the specialty drinks.  That dirty martini was as dirty as a 15 year old virgin choirgirl. I'm an adult - make it dirrrrrty.  Like X-rated nassssty!  Oh well, I still drank it.So overall I had a fun experience and the food was good.  I can see coming back when I get the craving for a hibachi experience.",Mikado Japanese Steak House,6158328300.0,1027.0,2011-06-27,"Nashville, TN",/biz/mikado-japanese-steak-house-nashville,4.0,18,"Washington, DC",Nickie G.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.1622296,-86.774353,566.7091028370305,False,2187.0,3.7777777777777777,,3.7777777777777777

The only problem we had (which is why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5) was that our anniversary trip we took there, we waited an hour and a half!!! This was outrageous and we almost just left. We decided to stick around since it was late and we wouldn't have a whole lot of other options besides fast food. When we finally got seated, we were placed next to a table of girls who were WAY PAST drunk. They were yelling at the top of their lungs and cussing up a storm. It was the most rude I have ever seen anyone act in a restaurant such as this one. Their behavior was more suited for a club or bar. It took a good 45 minutes of us being sat down at the table and eating before any staff EVER came to tell them to be quiet, and they didn't really even tell them to be quiet. It was just the bartender coming to tell them that they were cut off. So this upset the girls and they yelled and screamed for another 5 minutes or so, and then left on their own. Hopefully they weren't driving after that, but who knows. I was just very offended by the behavior and that no managers ever came to do anything about it.

Much appreciated after a long day's work. The rice was by far the standout of the night while the chicken and steak were both overcooked. I guess that can happen when diced into small pieces and left on a lava hot grill for too long.Mikado would be better if they dropped the boring soup and salad to start and focused more on grill preparation.

The tangy orange-colored sauce wasn't what I was expecting for a Nashville barbecue restaurant, but boy, did it hit the spot. The french fries were glorious; hot, oily, and crispy.

"7061 Hwy 70 SNashville, TN 37221",3.5,"I will preface this review with the statement: It really depends on what you are looking for, as it was not my cup of tea, but might be yours. I will focus on the pluses and minuses so you can make an informed decision.This was a family night out, and I have 4 children. Finding a table for all of us was a bit difficult, as it seems all of the tables are designed to fit four. After that, our server kept missing on nearly all cylinders which made it a drawn out experience with us reminding him many times of things that are missing. I am sure this is not always the case, but everything was moving in slow motion, on a night when slow motion was not my vibe.Dalton's is a bit weird in its layout, at least for a restaurant. Unlike Publicity, a few doors down, which is wider and shorter, Dalton's is very elongated. The trip to the bathroom, which is all the way in the back, feels like you are walking into the kitchen larder. There is a nice sized bar in the center of the establishment, which seemed to be a drawing place for some people I gathered as regulars (they knew the staff). It looks like they have some form of happy hour, as well, and I would guess at least one of the guests had been there since happy hour, as he was a few sheets to the wind. I don't take that out on the restaurant, just stating happy hour might be interesting to check out.The food is meat and three (or rather meat and two in most cases). Many of the items taste like they are poured out of cans without much additional prep. There are many other meat & three restaurants in the greater Nashville area, most of which are better, IMO.On the positive side, Dalton's is one of the more economical choices in Bellevue (other than Mexican or fast food) and has an extensive menu, a decent number of sides and a rotating specials menu. Talking to someone I knew who was leaving as we walked in, it is quite popular with the senior crowd. And, as it is one of a few restaurants in the immediate area that has the meat and three style. The only other homestyle American restaurant within a few miles at least, is Three Stones Pub, but their menu is not as extensive, either in menu or number of sides.Particulars: One of my daughter ordered the ribeye. It was okay, rather thin cut, and tasted a bit like it was marinated in beef broth to give it more flavor. But I guess steak is not the prime thing for a meat and three. I also tasted her cream corn, which was extremely bland. I had the Chicken Fried Steak. Standard frozen deep fried patty. The gravy was okay, which is a positive note. Green beans had a heavy canned taste. Wife said the Salmon was okay, but also commented on the green beans. The baked potato was a positive, although I am not a big fan of butter like spread in a small plastic cup, so I stole the real butter from the bread dish. Bread and corn cakes were probably the highlight of the meal, but we had to ask a few times to finally get them.I will talk to the seniors at church and see if there is any consensus on a favorite meal.

"7097 Old Harding PikeNashville, TN 37221",3.5,"I'd bought a Groupon for this place a few months ago that was due to expire this week, so we made the trek out last night.  We've tried a few Italian places in Nashville, and based on our one visit, I think pretty highly of Antonios' compared to the competition.Let me get out of the way the one thing I didn't like before I jump to all the awesomeness of our dinner.  Before seating us, they asked if we had a Groupon.  That's one of my pet peeves.  It always makes me wonder if we're about to get second-class service, or a reduced menu, or what.  So let me use this review to implore restaurant owners:  if you agree to a deal with Groupon, take it cheerfully at the end of the meal and don't ask people if they have one before they're done.  I can count several restaurants in the Nashville area on which I've spent hundreds of dollars, but I never would have tried them without a Groupon.OK, rant over.  We were seated at a table in the back corner of the restaurant, which was great for us.  The waitress brought out a small complimentary plate of bruschetta.  Main course prices are about what you'd expect -- roughly $14 to $19 for the pasta dishes, and $18-$28 for most of the pure meat dishes.Other reviewers have raved about the shrimp bisque in cognac.  Believe them.  Served in a bread bowl, it's rich, creamy, and delicious.  At a $10 price tag, you might be tempted to forego it -- but if you like bisque, I'd recommend you try it.We were also really pleased with the complimentary house salads.  The dressing was creamy and delicious (hey, you noticing a trend here?).  And, the leaves were fresh.  In general, I don't love salads, but we both agreed this one was excellent.My girlfriend tried the Capellini alla Guidea ($17), which was an angel hair pasta in a red wine and cream sauce with Italian bacon, artichoke hearts, and mushrooms, along with slight hints of green onions and tomatoes.  It was easily one of the better pastas we've tried in Nashville.  I was tempted to order the saltimbocca on the menu, but opted for a nightly special -- a beef tenderloin entree prepared with a veal demi-glace topped with a handful of peppercorns and served alongside an asparagus risotto.  The risotto was divine.  I don't love asparagus, but it was easy to pick those out.  The beef was out of this world.  It was tender, the sauce was rich, and whatever kind of peppercorns they used (not your usual peppercorns) gave it an extra punch when you'd bite into one.Overall, this place was a hit.  Even though it's a bit of a drive and not very convenient, I'd easily go back.  (Remember what I said about Groupons creating frequent customers?)  The flavors were good, the portion sizes were substantial, and the prices were all reasonable.  Definite winner.",Antonio’s,6156469166.0,62.0,2011-02-08,"Washington, DC",/biz/antonios-nashville,4.0,21,"Washington, DC",Brian S.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,38.8949549,-77.03664559999999,1.3688331711774772e-12,True,2793.0,3.7142857142857144,4.0,3.7

I wish Davidson County had more than just two good public schools because, Hillsboro and all, I really love the neighborhood. Quite the preamble, huh? Well (hyuck) you can't help but to marvel at the surroundings when making your way to The Well. Parking is tight (relative to demand) so odds are you're going to have to drive up and down the winding road to find parking... but you shouldn't mind it too much. This section of Granny White is quite picturesque no matter the time of year. The proximity to Lipscomb means there will be plenty of college kids engaging in college kid ways (ymmv) but it also means that a manicured campus is nearby and the electricity of youth and promise hangs in the air.*Once you enter, you're taken in by the vibe and specific point of view.

You're not just sitting around sucked into the ennui of achingly hip trustafarians. You're actually helping to make the world a better place. That's pretty amazing. And, for those who bemoan the religious aspect of The Well... 2 things: 1.) It helps people. HELPS. Do you help people? If not, you should. And, really, who complains about helping people? And if you do, please, stay far away. 2.) One of the muses of Nashville is Gospel (music). Religious tradition is woven into the very fabric of Nashville. It's part of the gig.And even better? The coffee is really really good. This isn't a case of charity. You're going to like what you buy. In addition to offering beans from all over for those who grind and make their own coffee, The Well has delicious baked goods and a seasonal menu that will make you happy. Since autumn is my favorite season, let me write about the autumnal (what an awesome word) offerings: chocolate pumpkin muffins and the Cozy Sweater drink. The muffin is every bit as delicious as you're imaging. Get it warm. The drink is a comfy blend of coffee, cinnamon, spice and whipped cream. Perfect name for the drink, no? Stop in.

There were two servers on and the restaurant appeared to still be picking up the pieces from a busy lunch. We asked to be seated outside, and every table was either seated or covered in the garbage left behind by parents with kids or groups of people having several beers. We ordered drinks and then our food, and waited probably 20 minutes to receive one small, thin crust pizza and the firecracker penne pasta. The pasta was sufficiently al dente, but the sauce was certainly more sweet than anything else; although there was a fair amount of Italian sausage and pepperoni in the dish, there was nothing that would inspire me to label it as a ""firecracker"". As a plus, the sauce appeared to be legitimately scratch made, there were considerable chunks of reduced tomato, albeit canned. The pizza was covered in cheese and toppings and the thin crust was quite crisp and flaky, my wife was thoroughly satisfied, although did question the value of the size and price equation.Considering what she was being asked to do, our waitress did an admirable job, but we definitely had to wait a bit to both request and then receive the check. Shortly before we received our food, it appeared there was a management shift change or perhaps a visit from the owner, because both servers and the duty manager came out and began to clean the wrecked patio. Just after we received our food, the server taking care of the table behind us came out the door with enough force to lose the pizza tray he was carrying and he dropped half a pizza on the floor. His reflexes were fairly quick, but the damage had been done, and I had a front row seat for the reaction from the table and the subsequent interactions with the manager. The restaurant handled it well from what I could tell, even though one of the guests was a bit prickly. Food+drinks+service+tax for this experience equaled just shy of 40 bucks.

"6917 Lenox Village DrNashville, TN 37211",3.0,"I live nearby and have been reluctant to write this review for quite a while now. I don't want the place to fail because it's actually a really good spot and could be and should be much more successful.To start, I moved to Lenox Village before Pie In The Sky was even a blue print. When it first went in it was a hit! It has good, fresh food that doesn't make you feel sick after you eat it, like some pizza and Italian restaurants do. Even though a few select dishes are excellent, I think they could really step up their use of seasoning because the other dishes, even though they are fresh, could use a little more love from the chef who created the menu. They should have that certain unique punch that you can't get anywhere else which makes you crave it and want to come back and pay the prices they command. With regards to the decor, it's not bad. It's actually quite interesting and a great place for the family early on and a group of friends to gather or couples to go for date night.The biggest negative I personally give Pie In The Sky Lenox Village is the lack of attention to detail. Even though the place is clean and I have personally witnessed the managers hold the staff to their closing duties, the owners neglect to maintain the decor. There are marks on the wall and places that could use a little spackling. Let's be realistic...how much does it really cost to touch up a freaking wall of a place that makes you $? Also, there has been at least one lightening bolt decoration in the main dining room that has been out for about the last two years. Really? How much does that cost to replace? My guess is it's too cheap to ignore, but yet the owner has had time to hang up beer neon signs which are really tacky for the type of establishment Pie is geared for. Don't get me wrong, I like going out for a little late night bar crawl from time to time, but Pie is not it. They close early and appear to get most of their business from families, early dinner parties, and date night couples, not bar goers. I'm sure anyone who drives by pie knows it serves a reasonable selection of beers. Marketing the bar isn't really that necessary, IMO. My last biggest annoyance is the floors, especially the concrete. When Pie first opened it had a nice finished concrete floor, now it is so worn out, it's pretty much raw...ugly...concrete. In the past ~5 - 6 years  that Pie has been opened, the floors have never been refinished or recovered. At least the kitchen floors look great, but I just can't understand why this has been neglected. I can't understand why businesses don't realize that letting things go often shows sign of a failing place and people don't want to come back and be a part of that. If you want to command premium pizza prices then you have to create and maintain a premium experience! It's pretty simple.Ok, I am done ranting about the negatives, so I will finish with my overall review. I recommend this place. The food is good, the staff is friendly and above average on service. The prices are a tad above what you may expect but are still reasonable. The place is clean and it has a great patio, so you won't be disappointed. I just hope the owners are reading this and will update/maintain the restaurant better than they are doing.

Failure occurred yet again, I know there is a general problem with tomatoes right now, but these tomatoes were just horrible. They obviously came from a very cheap food supplier. The place gets 2 stars, because the servers I had were very attentive and filled my beverage up a crapload of times. The service was excellent. The rest of everything, was bad. It takes a lot for me to bitch about food too, but this is pizza that I will never eat again. I might try them again for a calzone or something, but seeing as that is just a folded pizza with the same dough and shitty ingredients, I doubt it.

There was a pet grooming shop, a dry cleaner, and a small doctor's office. There was a neighborhood pub with karaoke on Saturdays.The one thing it did not have was a coffee shop, and boy did it need one. Other than a couple Starbucks that required a drive of several miles in Nolensville/Old Hickory traffic, this area was a veritable coffee desert. That's why I was incredibly excited to see Grounds 4 Inspiration open its doors late last year. From my first visit in November, the staff has been friendly, the lattes have been quality for the price, and the location cannot be beat. The coffee drinks are standard variety - Lattes, Cappuccinos, Mochas, etc. - but they are well-made with Vienna Roasters beans and capable baristas.

"105 3rd Ave SNashville, TN 37201",2.0,"A few weeks back on a Saturday night we were downtown walking around after dinner and noticed this place.  It looked nice and it was busy.  Being ""busy"" can mean the place is good, but location and timing makes a big difference too.  We wanted to come back.  We did on September 7th at about 9:00 pm.  It was as busy as before. The place is just around the corner of Broadway, so people are everywhere. If they get repeat business, it means they are good and not just lucky to be where they are.  I usually don't do many reviews, but I did want Luigi's to know that they are lucky to be where they are.  Sure, the food was great and the staff was good (to my face), but even great food is not enough to keep the doors open and the management needs to learn that.  While eating, we observed the place was a lot like Mafiosa's on 12th Ave.  It will not have the same crowd, but it stays open late, it's a place people will go to do a lot of drinking while eating, and it's loud.  However, this place is much louder than Mafiosa's. For that reason alone, this is NOT a place for a family dinner. But they are not trying to be Pizza Hut.  They have a small dance floor area and it is much more of a bar than Mafiosa's would ever consider being.  We ordered meatball's as an appetizer.  They were served with a lot of sauce which was both tasty and useful for dipping our pizza crust in. I think the meatballs are better than Mafiosa's and the pizza was as comparable as well.  Another similarity between Luigis and Mafiosa's is that their bathrooms are not up to par.  HOWEVER, Louigi's bathroom was MUCH MUCH worse than anything I have seen in a restaurant that looked so nice from the outside.  Clearly, no one from the place checked the restrooms since lunch.  There were no paper towels in either dispenser.  There were plenty of them on the floor, sink, and urinal. There were empty beer bottles on counters and here and there.  This looked worse than many college bar restrooms at MTSU.  If any of the cooks used the bathroom, I bet they did not wash their hands.  The counter was soaked with water.  There was hardly a dry spot on the floor.  I don't have a clue what the toilets looked like, but I would bet the floor was wet and who knows what the seats would look like?  I was very irritated about it and as I walked out, I saw a fat lady in her late 30's who looked as though she may have been a supervisor of some sort.  I asked to speak to a manager and she said she served as one and could help.  I told her the bathroom was totally unacceptable and some of the reasons why.  She said she would send someone to look into it and I walked away.  My wife saw me talking to her and asked what the problem was.  Apparently, as I walked away, the fat lady was making faces behind my back and her body language indicated to my wife that this lady was dismissive of my concerns while talking to another employee.  Apparently the fat lady did not know my wife saw all that.  We decided that we would not let this ruin our dining experience.  But then my wife went to the bathroom before we left.  She came out a bit upset too.  I sent her in to take pictures, but it was too dark and crowded to take good photos.  The women's bathroom was trashed and the soap dispenser was off the wall and sitting on the countertop.  I don't guess the female employees wash their hands either.If you want great food in a convenient location (assuming you are already downtown on foot) then this is a decent choice.  The food was great.  The price is what you'd expect to pay at this location.  But if you go, be sure to use the bathroom somewhere else first.",Luigi’s City Pizza,6157429099.0,6.0,2014-09-07,"Hendersonville, TN",/biz/luigis-city-pizza-nashville,2.0,75,"Washington, DC",Will M.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.304773499999996,-86.6199957,555.0334180034542,False,3682.0,2.16,1.0,2.191780821917808

He was helpful as we re-arranged the tables slightly. He took our drink orders and brought out boatloads of bread!! I will be the first to say had a few picky eaters in the group. He had pitchers of water as well as sweet and un-sweet tea on the tables and brought out plenty of glasses. That was a wonderful move! We really appreciated that. He took our orders quickly and in a way that was easy for him to later separate the checks. There were no complaints on the food when it came out. Except one and I hate to say it but it was mine. It was brought out about 10 min after everyone else's and it was cold. Matt removed it from our bill and I was fine with that. I did have a delicious side ceasar salad and enjoyed it. Here's why they only get 3 stars (in case a manager sees this and cares) When you have a group of that size it would be nice to have people helping to run food and drinks out. Serving 15 people especially when half the table is ordering from the bar is not easy. So why no one else was helping to run food or drinks is beyond me.

In order to eat, at times, I've had to go places and do things it's taken years of therapy from which to recover. So, yeah. Drive-thrus. As a rule, I don't do 'em. But, here's the thing: it was getting on in the evening. I was tired. I was hungry. It was a Thursday. And, this joint looked like it had been here for years. It was, certainly, here before Inglewood started getting invaded by all sorts of non-Southerners.

This mission's difficulty might seem low, however as I'm a vegetarian and every restaurant I know of between my house and Madison that would have cheeseburgers of sufficient grease to soak up hangover juice has decided to close on Sundays (I'm looking at you Mixed Grill Cafe) I go through a list of various burger joints and this one comes up as open.I GPSed it, was getting into sketchier and sketchier area, and finally found this place and thought it was closed but pulled into the lot anyway. It was not closed, I just couldn't see the cars on the other side of the place.I had 0 expectations of getting myself anything, but they had a veggie burger so I went with it.

It was an interesting site.3 boxes of food and fries were given to me, I think the total was around $17, the weight on the boxes was pretty darn heavy. I put those in my passenger seat's foot area, headed down the road, hit a bump and lost a load of fries immediately. Note for future people, their boxes do not stack well. No biggie.Delivered greasy goods and sat down to my veggie burger. Fries were just about perfect. I think they might have been perfect 15 minutes before when I got them, but I do not know. Veggie burger, it was alright.. not the greatest in the world, but man, it was a lot of food. It crumbled to pieces while eating it and had to be finished with a fork.I'm told the cheeseburgers were excellent. It looked like there was enough there to feed a couple of people.Anyway, the place looks closed, sketchy, but it's not and the people were nice as I had no time to study the menu.

However, I gave in last night and was very pleasantly surprised by the delicious offerings here.

Here at La Hacienda and many other Nashville Mexican restaurants, the sopapillas resemble more of a simple fried tortilla topped with honey and cream (in the style of tortas fritas, which are more South American than Mexican). This is a huge disappointment if you're used to the fluffy, warm deliciousness of a sopapilla back in AZ. Sadly, the only place in Nashville I have seen so far with this style of sopapilla is at the otherwise touristy Chuy's.By the way, if the thought of menudo scares you (it's a spicy soup with tripe), I swear nothing is better for a hangover.

I don't do soft drinks much and I wasn't in the mood for a cocktail. But maybe if I had a darker or cloudier drink I wouldn't have noticed how dingy the water and glass were. It was an authentic serving of water from Mexico. No doubt..........I got a combination platter and the beef burrito was actually pretty good.

"2615 Nolensville RdNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"I love Mexican food. Most of the time when I am hungry and not exactly sure what I want for dinner, I settle on tacos, burritos or enchiladas. It is the comfort food that I never had growing up. For some strange reason, my family never ate at Mexican restaurants. It wasn't until High School that I discovered the pure magic that is re-fried beans. So I guess with all my Mexican food consumption lately, I'm just making up for lost time. La Hacienda on Nolensville Road is my go-to place for quick, quality Mexican grub. The space is large and bright. The service is friendly and fast. The margaritas are enormous, and the food is good. They have a variety of food, ranging from the familiar chicken quesadillas to the more adventurous tripe tacos (my absolute favorite thing in the world).I'm on a personal mission to find the best tripe taco in Nashville. If you are new to this blog and don't know about my predilection for all the ""gross"" parts of the animal, I apologize. But I love to eat the stuff that most people find too gross. La Hacienda makes, hands down, the best tripe taco I have had in Nashville. The tripe is fried crispy, but still retains the soft chewy goodness. I feel that most people fry the S#*& out of it and it ends up tasting like burnt bacon. But really good tripe is heaven! I also had a beef tongue taco and a cheese enchillada. The enchillada was just OK, but the tongue was great. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that La Hacienda shines in the taco department.Oh and the chips?! They have really good fresh fried chips with some tasty salsa. Their salsa is just a bit more spicy than your average table offerings. All things considered, I really like this place.

The first time we went was for 16th district Margarita Mondays but we came a bit earlier since we were already over that way. During their happy hour I was told the margaritas were buy one get one free. I tried to order a frozen strawberry margarita but our server told us that wasn't part of happy hour and was extra. I told him that was fine and he kept going off about something so I settled on a regular frozen margarita. I think the language barrier is what stopped me from having my strawberry margarita. I could barely understand my first server and I honestly think he couldn't understand me. I had to point to what I wanted on the menu.Second time around, I had family in town and they wanted late night Mexican so we ended up here. Our server was very sweet and chatty but not as attentive as I would've liked. I had to go to the front desk and tell them we were ready to order.

Our server told her she couldn't do it and to try something else. We tried explaining back to her that it was a different item altogether that she was suggesting and we were willing to pay extra for substituting. She said she didn't know if she could do it so I told her I was positive that she could and I would wait while she asked the manager. She came back and said it wouldn't be a problem. When our order came out, the cheese on the chicken was not like the picture at all. It was very watered down and the chicken was dry. Everyone that ordered chicken (most of our party) had the same complaint. When our server came back, I explained that there was hardly any jalapeno cheese on my chicken and could I get a small side.

"2615 Nolensville RdNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"Bummer. I was hoping all the great reviews from some of my friends indicated a transformation of this place. La Hacienda has enjoyed a long tenure as one Nashville's most beloved ""authentic"" cocina de Mexicano...because of tenure, IMHO. I moved here from the West Coast where we picked up our food from the homes of old ladies from Mexico throwing down enchiladas, chili colorado, tamales, chili verde, and stuffings for tacos. When we arrived here in the early 80s there was one joint down on Murf Road across from Channel 2 and then a spot on Nolensville Road, and then La Hacienda, and then Las Palmas...and...and...well, never mind about the history of Mexican food in Nashville. I learned many years ago that La Hacienda wasn't up to par with what should be considered ""good"" Mexican food and things haven't changed. La Hacienda's food is mediocre at best. The enchilada sauce tastes like it comes from a can which is a sin. The fajitas while meaty, lack the depth of seasoning and the caramelization that should come from proper searing (the same goes for the onions, peppers, and tomatoes served with the meat). The street taco in the form of chicken was not very good due to the bland flavor. Oh, the rice was boring as all get out but included peas and carrots and the refried beans lacked any creaminess or flavor. Some good news about the food, the carne asada tacos were good with salsa. The cheese dip was room temp, but had a nice flavor without any spice. The table salsa was canned tomato with some fresh onion, cilantro and chili and was a good for eating with the nice chips (thick). The ambience has nice murals of typical Mexican story telling. The tables and chairs are in the Equipale fashion with wood frames covered in leatheresque material. I'm a sucker for cool chairs and tables. The big draw back is that the overhead canned lighting is blaring fluorescent bulbs. Nothing makes people's skin tone look worse than the green cast from the unflattering bulbs. Additionally, it's cast produces a cold vibe and just lame. The mediocre food , the poor lighting, and over-hyped sensation of Nashville's ""BEST""...and it's unmerited popularity among non-hispanics...this place is a bummer.

"2615 Nolensville RdNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"I hate to write this review because one of the great things about Nashville is that it has actual authentic Mexican cuisine, not just Tex-Mex/Americanized Mexican food. By many accounts, La Hacienda is the best eating experience if you're after Mexican food that's not smothered in queso (not that there's anything wrong with queso)!Just not by my account as it turns out, because my recent trip to La Hacienda was bland and disappointing. The thing I love about Mexican food is its bright fresh flavors, and unfortunately these were utterly lacking in the dishes I ordered. I am a lover of lengua (tongue) and tripe tacos, so I ordered one of each, along with an ""al pastor"" (spicy pork) sope. Of the three items, the sope was the best, but both the tongue and tripe were pretty flavorless, tasting kind of gamey, but other than that, not like much of anything. The al pastor was unoffensive, but also not memorable. My husband ordered the chorizo burrito, and it was WAY too salty... also, his burrito was simply chorizo and a few measly chunks of avocado... no rice, no beans, nothing else. Rather than layers of flavor, this was just one solid wall of salt.Three-stars because this place is serving up the ghost of authentic Mexican food, and it's nice for people to see that you can get something other than chimichangas (though they have those too). Unfortunately the quality just wasn't there. If you look around the restaurant, it's mostly filled with gringos, many of whom I suspect are ordering the more Americanized offerings. If you're really jonesing for a sope, come here I guess, but otherwise you are much better off going to El Tapatio (3611 Nolensville Pike) which is so delicious and also offers birria! You may have to pantomime along with your English to be understood as it mostly caters to non-English speakers, but it is so worth it!All told, the best thing I had here was the corn popsicle from Las Palletas that they were selling by the cash register.

"2615 Nolensville RdNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"La Hacienda seems to evoke varying opinions and emotions in people. I think this stems from the expectations that we Nashville diners have from a Mexican restaurant. Here is the way I have come to think of it: if you want the standard fare of meat enveloped in some sort of tortilla, covered with cheese and sour cream, don't eat here, pick almost anywhere else.If you would like to eat Mexican food that Mexican people eat, eat here. Here you will find tacos that are resplendent in their simplicity: meat, (steak or chicken) onions, cilantro, lime. Note that there is no cheese, lettuce, or sour cream to dull the flavors. If you want fantastic shrimp cocktails, fish tacos, or ceviche, eat here. Contrary to other opinions, I say La Hacienda is a fine place for a first or second date, having actually done that. It's a place that although is lacking in romantic ambiance, has an authenticity perfect for finding out just the right things about that new person. Share a 60oz margarita (made and served best by waiter Margarito - that really is his name). If you go here often, the staff will remember you and spoil you accordingly.  On a recent birthday celebration we got free shots of Petron and general merriment. Other things to try are the guacamole, which is truly delicious. The classic burrito is a meal in itself for only $3.99. One of my favorite tricks is the shrimp quesedilla with added lime and cilantro.I will admit that dining at La Hacienda is all about knowing what to order. The best way to do this is sit, order some guacamole and a margarita, and watch what comes out of the kitchen.

I went and got it.Sat down, bit into it, opened up the sandwich and the bacon was missing.Went back up to the cashier and said, ""There's no bacon.""A guy came out and said, ""I'm going to make it myself.""I went and sat down, drank my water, munched on some fries.He brought it out to me and said, ""Maam, I made it myself.""I thanked him, opened it up and tomato seeds were dripping out of it.The bacon and cheese were there, and so was the tomato, I didn't order.I couldn't go through that, again.  I pulled the tomato out and ate it.To say that I speak another language, would be incorrect.To say that they did not understand english, would be incorrect.To say that there is something very, very wrong with employees that can't get a damn burger right....All I can do is shake my head and bite my tongue and not say something that will come back and bite me in the ass.Expect the unknown.That's all I can say.",Cook Out,6152269170.0,394.0,2014-12-04,"Nashville, TN",/biz/cook-out-nashville-2,3.0,17,"Washington, DC",Queen B.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.1622296,-86.774353,566.7091028370305,False,1510.0,3.5294117647058822,,3.5294117647058822

You can get your hopes up because the place has the same name and is in the same location and is almost the same looking from the outside and practically identical in the inside (so much so it's like walking into a time-warp).I grew up on Obie's pizza and started coming as a baby in the 1980s. My parents were Obie's fanatics and were always there from the time it first opened in about 1979. The originator of the place was a young guy who was killed unexpectedly shortly after it opened. Obie's changed hands many times after that but the new operators always remained true to the original recipe. The place was called Obie's Flying Tomato Pizza back then. They served thin crust, pan, and deep dish Chicago style pizzas.All of us were such Obie's lovers that even though we moved away in the early 90's when any of us came back to Nashville we'd always bring several pizzas back on the plane (when you were allowed to do that sort of thing) for the rest of the family. The last time I did that was about 2001. A year of so after that we got a call from my aunt to forewarn us that Obie's had changed owners yet again and this time the pizza changed too.I decided to stop by recently even though I'd been told by other family who checked out the change not to go because there is no way I would like it they said. I couldn't resist the temptation. The owner was there and I just came out and asked him if his pizza was anything at all like the original Obie's. He said he wouldn't know because he never had the original Obie's but to please go ahead and try his. He also said the current Obie's pizza was a recipe he created. So we ordered and I found that the pizza wasn't bad; I thought it was just okay judging it objectively not comparing it to the original. My aunt was with me and was surprised that the recipe had changed yet again from when she was there in about 2007.At the end of our meal the owner asked me if his Obie's pizza tasted anything like the original. I told him it tasted nothing at all like the original but was still decent pizza which was the truth and he seemed happy with that.If anyone out there happens to know the recipes for the ORIGINAL (circa 1979 - 2000) Obie's Flying Tomato deep dish and pan pizzas let me know!!",Obie’s Pizza,6153274772.0,37.0,2010-10-15,"Phoenix, AZ",/biz/obies-pizza-nashville-2,3.0,24,"Washington, DC",Ava P.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,33.44676810000001,-112.07567240000002,1981.9256581297577,False,2603.0,3.5,4.0,3.4782608695652173

I don't typically hang out much on the Broadway scene as it's so touristy and I had no idea what to expect but I'm open-minded. The music was just dance pop and generic mainstream hits. Nothing I listen to as my tastes lean indie but if I have a few drinks in me I can tolerate it for a bit. So if you don't have mainstream preference in music might not be a place you enjoy. But that's not the reason for my 1 star, my reason is because of one extremely rude bartender. It's a rare day that I come across a service staff so rude that I am seething with anger. I had an open tab. I go up to him and say ""gin and tonic, I have an open tab and give my name"". I had to repeat this a few times. Then he rudely yells in my face ""what do you want?"" Like I'm some bumbling moron when I said what I wanted for the 3rd time. Then at the end of the night I go to close my tab and the ass**** literally ignores me. He serves everyone else around me and pretends I'm not even standing there. I've never been treated like that in any venue in my life. I went to a different bartender, a lady and she was very fast and served me with a smile. But that one guy there deserves to be fired and totally tainted my experience.

My sister in-law suggested making a reservation since the wait is apparently long all of the time. She was right, 1 hour, 15 minutes. I would definitely make sure you have a reservation. Despite having a reservation, we still waited about 30 minutes for a seat. They don't have the typical buzzing circles that alert you to your awaiting table, they text you. The nice thing is, they're in the mall, so you can walk around a bit plus they have a very interactive store where you can shop around while you wait. Our table of six was seated at the back right of the restaurant between the kitchen entrance and the bathroom entrance next to the Tiger Family display. Not an idea place to sit. Every 1-3 minutes someone is coming out screaming 'Volcano"" or singing Happy Birthday to a guest. If possible, you might consider requesting another seat. The ordering process is easy enough. The waitress seemed to really know what was on the menu & was confident in her suggestions. The restaurant seemed to be out of at least one ingredient for every drink my husband tried to order. As a side note, their mixed drinks are quite week. Might be best to stick with beer/wine. It's a very nice touch to get to keep the glass though! My husband and brother both got a rib meal that neither seemed to really enjoy. I had a primavera that wasn't too great, just too much oil. My sister in-law had a turkey wrap which was good and the kids thoroughly enjoyed their meals. All in all, I would say it's over priced for sure, but you pay for the experience I guess.

And usually even the most disgruntled server lightens up and compliments the kids for being well behaved.

Plus, you can make a reservation to avoid having to wait later.What prevents me from giving them five stars is they took their delicious crab dip off the menu, so boo to them.Firstly, their food. The fish and chips are great. I almost always get the chicken Bamba's barbecue wrap. It is soooo good. Very different flavour. I normally hate raw onions (especially red onions, ugh) but they work in this dish and couldn't imagine asking them to leave them off. The barbecue sauce is a little smoky and a little fruity, very nice. Love the addition of cilantro too, it just makes for a totally different dish you can't get anywhere else. Plus, it's HUGE. When you get it, it looks okay. But trust me, you can't finish it (or at least I never can). You'll either need to split it with someone or get a doggy bag.I don't get to go as often as I'd like so I've not been able to try everything, but they do have some stuff that you can't get at other places, at least not at other chain restaurants, like macadamia crusted tilapia, dynamite scallops, and their Tuscan chicken.Their service is great, and the ambiance is nice. The music is a little loud, but it's definitely aimed to keep little kids entertained. It's not necessarily the kind of place you'd go on a date, but otherwise it's fine even if you don't have kids with you. Between all the fish and the fake animals on the walls and such, it's usually enough to keep the kids at other tables entertained so you don't have to deal with squealing kids or anything.

"2525 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"I find a lot of the other reviews on here really frustrating. Because I heart this place so hard that I can't make sense of how people can feel so negatively. So first I will acknowledge what I think *are* real problems here: 1) The Setup. Yes, it's confusing. Yes, there has to be a better way. It would make much more sense to have one register for the custom food orders and another for coffee and baked goods. But wait! There is! Only thing is, it's not always open and it's still pretty damn confusing which one you should go to.2) The Coffee. It's terrible. I've gotten coffee here a couple of times, once regular coffee, another time a latte. Once my friend ordered a chai and I ordered a soy latte, and we seriously couldn't tell the difference between them. I don't know how this is possible. They have a big fancy espresso machine back there, but it seems like maybe they're using coffee beans to make espresso? Who knows. I suggest you stick with tea, water, or soda. Regular coffee if you must. It says online that they use Bongo Java. I'm going to have to try it again, as I've gotten it at the end of the day, and perhaps it was bad because it was sitting there too long.But now, on to what this place is best at: FOOD.Their breakfast sandwiches are ginormous and so damn tasty. You can custom build them on croissants, bagels, or any of their fresh baked breads. It's $5.50. This might seem expensive for two ingredients, except when you realize that it's 2 ingredients *in addition to* eggs (and you can get egg whites no extra charge).The breakfast choice FTW, though, is the french toast. People, this is the best french toast I have had in my entire life, and a ton of food for its $7.19 price, which is totally reasonable for a breakfast entree. If you don't want one of the main breakfast things, you can't go wrong with their baked goods. Everything I've had has been incredible, including their desserts. As far as the lunch options, the sandwiches are killer. To be honest, I've only ever had the farm bread, because it's so amazing I can't bring myself to order anything else. I crave the Fresh Mozzarella sandwich all the time, and that's my default order, but the Boulder Veggie is also good. And they do a 1/2 sandwich + soup or salad special, which is a little cheaper and still plenty filling. I would very much like to disagree with statements made about their food not being higher quality than places like Panera. For me, the difference is night and day. Bread & Co is high quality, with the focus on freshness, rather than completely shorting out your system by loading on as many flavors as possible. I would never choose Panera or Provence over Bread & Co.A great option they have is their grab-and-go case, which stocks tons of sandwiches so you can cut out part of the waiting. Sadly I've never seen the Fresh Mozzarella in the prepared sandwich case. If they sold it that way, I'd probably be running in to grab and go far more often. I definitely recommend this place for brunches or late/early lunch and dinner. It can get very crowded with students around lunch, since it accepts Commodore Cash.The most prohibitive thing about Bread & Co is the parking situation. This lot just isn't big enough for the amount of businesses here. If you can find street or meter parking, I recommend that. I've witnessed a screaming match between people vying for the same parking spot here.  Please try this place out and be willing to wait in line for a short bit.  Yes it can be annoying, but I promisepromisepromise it's totally worth it.",Bread & Company,6153291400.0,147.0,2011-04-30,"Louisville, KY",/biz/bread-and-company-nashville-2,4.0,72,"Washington, DC",Amanda A.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,38.254237599999996,-85.759407,474.1990768248562,False,3570.0,3.0694444444444446,,3.0694444444444446

And to add to my not-so-original Yelp list of eats on West End Ave. And ordering here was surprisingly easier than when I left confused and empty-handed last week.For one thing, I went for breakfast. The first register had 4 people in line, but only 1 person was paying for herself. The other 3 were just extra warm bodies making the line longer than it needed be. So, it turned out that the first register nearest the entrance is where I should go to order a breakfast sandwich. I will have to come back to see which line to go to for lunch and / or the prepackaged meals.I had the lox and bagel. While it was good, it was not spectactular. Definitely pricey -- over $10 for a multigrain bagel with chive cream cheese, a reasonable serving of lox, capers, onions, and diced cucumbers and tomatoes. It was served open-faced, which is probably a good thing since the capers and various veggies will start rolling out. And stupid me, I forgot to ask what kind of lox they use. Apparently, as of a few days ago, there is a recall of Vita Nova salmon, due to potential lysteria contamination. The coffee was smooth. Did not give me a stomachache, which means that it was not strong. In total, I spent $13+ for a bagel with lox combo and coffee. It's the amount I expected to pay at a Marriott/Hyatt/Hilton room service breakfast. Even back in San Francisco, the last time I ordered a similar meal, it was only $7 and change (and instead of coffee I had a cafe au lait and they piled on the lox).I might come back someday to try out their cookies and pastries. And I would probably buy my own lox and my own bagels before I'd come here to try this particular meal combo again.They do give cups for free water, which I needed because I accidentally had some of the capers (which I forgot to ask them to not add since they're too salty for me).

"1008 Woodland StNashville, TN 37246",4.0,"2.5Let's start with the obvious: there are some concessions you have to make once you commit to buying sushi from a New England-styled fried fish restaurant. Let it be noted that a sushi-specific restaurant in Edgefield/East End would go over very well. In fact, I can think of more than a couple of potential locations for such. I'm not sayin'; I'm just sayin'.So, it came to pass that I didn't want to drive Downtown or to West End for sushi. So, I looked over the menu, called and made the short walk over to Wave. I was pleased to note the sushi bar I never noticed on previous trips to B&F but I couldn't really get the reality of the situation out of my head. I know strangers things happen in the world of current food. I know, in some cities, gas station sushi is de rigueur. I don't know that Nashville is there yet. Of my two rolls, I wasn't that happy with either. They were edible and I didn't get ill but I had higher expectations in my head.* My dragon roll was a bit tough/chewy and my scallop roll was fishy. Before I opened the container, I could smell it. Not my finest moment in deciding to eat it but I was coming off a particularly busy week (Friday night) and I was ravenously hungry. Know that you have better options, Nashville. Let people do what they do best and keep it moving. When you're heading to 10th & Woodland with the need for fish in your head/belly, keep it fried or grilled. You'll have a much better experience.*Probably my bad.",Wave Sushi Bar,6152269283.0,1642.0,2015-08-10,"Nashville, TN",/biz/wave-sushi-bar-nashville,3.0,5,"Washington, DC",Johnny T.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.1622296,-86.774353,566.7091028370305,False,1467.0,3.8,,3.8
"1008 Woodland StNashville, TN 37246",4.0,"Being new to Nashville we weren't sure where to go get our Sushi fix. With the name on the outside of this restaurant being ""Batter'd & Fried"" we were definitely reluctant. We looked at their sushi menu and there was a good selection and We also peeped out what was on peoples plates; everybody looked like they were enjoying their food so we gave it a shot. We ordered swordfish tacos: the fish was cooked really well in these and the cucumber sauce was a nice touch. These were light yet filling. For our sushi options we ordered a tuna roll (came with 6 pieces for about $7) and the salmon roll (came with 6 pieces for about $7), and the sunflower roll (came with 6 pieces for about $10). Everything tasted fresh, including the ginger and wasabi. The sunflower rolls were stuffed with things including a kiwi which added a nice sweet flavor combined with everything else. I also ordered a cocktail which looked better then it tasted. The atmosphere was low key, not pretentious at all all which I'm finding some of the East Nashville places can be.
