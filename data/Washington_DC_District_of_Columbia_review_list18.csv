4.5,Healthy Food Fast - served in a cup,"If you need food fast and your goal is something healthy then give it a try.
I liked my vegetarian chili and I tasted some other dishes that our table ordered.
I thought the chicken Parmesan dish, while served in a cup, was a delicious meal. On the menu it is called Healthy Parm and has 341 calories and 15...

4.5,Maybe my favorite part of DC,"My husband and I just visited some friends in DC, but were mostly on our own during the day to explore. We were tired of eating burgers and pizza and LUCKILY happened to find Protein Bar...I only wish we'd found it sooner.

4.5,A unique experience.,"The other night I was on my way to Hill Country BBQ and wanted to get my kids a snack because we had to wait for a table.

4.5,An Unsanitary Downward Turn,"The Penn Quarter's Protein Bar was my wife and my favorite healthy fast food option--until yesterday.
Enroute to a DC Filmfest movie Saturday, April 13th, we stopped for an early dinner at Protein Bar. One of our favorites for its healthy menu and usually friendly service, yesterday's experience was simply poor. The service was uncharacteristically indifferent--the crew on duty clearly...

4.5,Not the worst smoothie experience I've ever had.,"The smoothies we got were really delicious, but it took a long, long time to get them even though the store was almost totally empty.

4.5,"Healthy, quick and friendly","We stopped by for breakfast. The menu had an OK selection, even for those with allergies and other restrictions. I grabbed an egg bowl (egg whites, spinach, veggies, hot sauce -- hold the cheese). It was decent -- pretty peppery, but not bad. My friend ordered a quinoa bowl with fruit, which she said was delish and filling. We each...

4.5,Delicious and healthy food!,Completely blown away by the lunch menu. Every smoothie has been delicious and the Greek salad wrap was also incredible. Wish there were more of these around.

4.5,Healthy Choice in Penn Quarter,"If you find yourself around the Archives at lunch time and would like something healthy to eat, or require vegan or gluten-free dishes, you can't go wrong with the Protein Bar.
