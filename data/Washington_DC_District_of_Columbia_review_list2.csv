4.5,Great Tapas Bar / Restaurant on 14th Street,"The Estadio is really a great place if you like Tapas, they have a huge selection, fish, seafood, meat, veggie. The wines in there are not too great but still good quality. Prices are ok for DC. The ambience in the place is great. If you like to go there in a smaller group be there early to get on...

4.5,Fabulous Tapas,"My husband and I dined at Estadio on a Saturday evening in August. The restaurant was packed, but we managed to get a table by arriving just before 7p.m. The atmosphere at the restaurant is energetic and fun. The wine list is extensive and the tapas menu is one to rival some of the restaurants that I have eaten in...

4.5,Great food and wine,Been there a few times now and tapas food is excellent. I haven't had a bad bottle of wine there either. Their slushy drinks are phenomenal too. Don't be afraid of the community tables and be prepared to wait since they don't take reservations. No valet either for those with cars.,Estadio,57,46,"August 10, 2011","Arlington, VA",/Restaurant_Review-g28970-d1908511-Reviews-Estadio-Washington_DC_District_of_Columbia.html,5.0,326,"Washington, DC",alcw
4.5,Magnificent,"Get there early as they don’t take reservations for groups under six people – but be prepared to have a great time, both from a food and atmosphere perspective. The restaurant / bar is casual and the patrons are every age group. The food, Spanish tapas, is outstanding. The open face sandwich, “Foie Gras Mousse, Smoked Duck & Caramelized Onions”...

4.5,Among my favorite.,"Great atmosphere, particularly if you sit at either bar (the kitchen bar is my favorite). The service is quite good, particularly when my server is not attempting to up-sell me.
For the most part the food is quite good. The foie gras tartine and the roasted beets dish are marvelous! I have attempted to eat the lamb a couple of...

4.5,A new favorite in DC!,"The food here is absolutely spectacular! It is tapas but very creative and fresh. A very fun place. My only negative was that I ordered a second glass of wine and my server took so long that by then I was on dessert(20 minutes). I did let her know it would have been better with the food and she took...

4.5,"Decent food, small plates, trendy crowd","Visited for the first time recently on a Monday night. Had to sit @ the bar it was so crowded. Hip crowd, into themselves and not friendly to outsiders. Knowledgeable bar staff. Good selection of wines by the glass. Careful how the small plates add up, my bill was a bit richer than i had imagined. Sitting at the bar...

4.5,Heart vibrations,"We have been in DC for two months going to restaurants which left us short of money and starved of real nourishment. It was a pleaure to find Estadio, a place where they care about the quality of food, about the way it is prepared, about smiling and attentive service, about atmosphere. And about taste. Regardless of a great bottle...

4.5,"Way too expensive, way too crowded","The food was okay, but the tapas-sized dishes are priced like full entrees. The place is tiny, difficult to get in to, and very loud from the crowd. They do have an interesting collection of specialty cocktails.",Estadio,148,89,"February 4, 2011","Washington, DC",/Restaurant_Review-g28970-d1908511-Reviews-Estadio-Washington_DC_District_of_Columbia.html,2.0,326,"Washington, DC",MikeMfromWashDC
4.5,A bit of improvement in the food and Estadio will be excellent,"Had dinner at Estadio last weekend. This is a very busy, popular place so definitely make a reservation. We were greeted promptly and warmly by the hostesses as we entered and immediately led to our table by the window on 14th St. The restaurant is very attractive and has a high energy level. We lived in Spain for 5 years...

4.5,"Terrific experience, wonderful service","My wife and I happened into this restaurant early on a Friday evening before a theater performance down the street. What a find! We were fortunate to walk in fairly early because by the time we left it was wall-to-wall people.
We were seated at a bar table and immediately ordered their homemade Sangria which was delicious. Then a very...

4.5,Tapas Bar in DC,"If you are looking for an active lively neighborhood bar/restaurant in Washington DC, this is it. Getting a seat can be difficult, so I went for the bar, which on a weekday was also standing only. You can have a spanish style tapa and a glass of wine. Acceptable and expensive, but the atmosphere makes up for it. Busy and...
