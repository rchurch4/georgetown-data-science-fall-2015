First off I want to start with the staff. Very friendly and down to earth! Whether you're having lunch, watching the game or just chilling out for a drink, they'll cater to your every need. The owner is all about the people. I like that fact that he's just this young guy that has a restaurant and treats people like you've entered his home. I can tell he's going to go a long way with it. Kudos to the staff!Now let's talk about the food. I've only tried a few things off the menu (basically eating off other people's plates! Haha!). I wanted to start things off by trying the wings first. I tried the Cajun Rub wings and the basic hot wings but my favorite of course was the Cajun. Very saucy, peppery and it's comes with a kick of heat to let you know that you're not going to just stick your face in them! Haha! Comes with time! They're so good! If you're in the mood for wings, order them and get your fingers ready because you're going to be licking every bit of that sauce! Mmm yummy! Fried pickles? No problem! Could compete with Hooters, which in my opinion is the best fried pickles I've ever had. I noticed a lady beside me that ordered a Blues Burger which is basically a huge bacon cheeseburger soaked in bleu cheese, lettuce, tomato and onions. I think that's going to be my next option! Everyone in the restaurant, even people that I've talked to around the way has given this place very good reviews on their food. I will be another \u00a0to add a review on here to say that their food is really good! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they're brand new and just taking off.

This location downtown offers the same standards as the original (burritos, tacos, taco salads, etc.) with just as much consistency as the others. The taco trio is always a good bet--especially when you try a sampler (I usually go with the chipotle chicken, steak and a fish taco). The chipotle chicken is always tasty, but I find the steak a little middle-of-the-road. It's not bad, but it could have more flavor. The fish tacos are among my top choices with each visit, but my only compliant is that the tortillas seem to disintegrate before I have a chance to finish the taco.One of the pluses that Blue Coast has over the other Mexican-themed chains is their salsa selection. It reminds me of what they offer at Baja Fresh or Moe's, but with a lot more flavor. Their pineapple salsa is my favorite, but I enjoy the salsa verde just as much. They also have two kinds of traditional salsa (spicy and not-so-spicy) and a roasted tomato salsa. The chips/salsa/drink add-on for every combo is a must.This location is tucked away off 5th Avenue.

The good- the veggies were fresh and accurate to the real deal- carrots, cucumber, daikon and plenty of cilantro. The flavors were pretty close- savory, light mayo added some zing. However, the general texture was too soft. Banh mi is traditionally on a french baguette, and the bread used here is just too soft and chewy. The meat also was very soft- it reminded me of shredded pork and beef used to make bbq, just without the bbq sauce. Altogether, it made for a very soft sandwich that fell apart quite easily. The egg rolls were also soggy rather than crispy. Only the fries held some crisp, but they were extremely salty.

I used to think that it was the coolest thing for the waiters to write their names upside down and then leave me a bunch of crayons to keep me occupied. I loved the fresh bread and the spicy olive oil and I had several first dates there - if I was lucky I had a second date there too. Alas, gone are the glory days of the old Macaroni Grill. I recently dined at this location and had a bad experience. \u00a0There were so many things wrong here I don't even know where or how to start so I'll just try to sum it up to get this over with. Amateur service you'd expect from a group of beginners included a server spilling a drink on the way to a different table, stopping to ask if the guest was ok, then proceeding to the original table, serving the food, then cracking fresh pepper (this was happening as a full glass of tea made its way to the floor and pooled while not a single server in the place made an effort to clean it or even apologize). Among the comedy of errors was a dirty table that remained uncleared for at least 30 minutes next to us, 4 different dirty wine glasses that were cycled through one table, one of our orders being wrong, no water refills during the entire time we there, and extremely slow service in general.The food used to be so good but it's become a standard corporate menu that is no better than the olive Garden and I hate to say it but I've had better pastas from the freezer section at Target. Stale bread and cheap olive oil seem to be the par here as we ordered my all time favorite the lobster ravioli which was a mess. \u00a0Not a single vegetable in this watery sauce that the waiter explained \"was the way they make it\". \u00a0Sad...Add insult to injury we were given the check without being asked if we wanted desert! Now, normally that wouldn't have mattered but we had a birthday in the group. \u00a0As we sat and stared at each other in dismay we thought it was best that we never got a chance to order desert or even look at the dessert menu. Maybe would could salvage the night and get a subpar dessert at the local grocery store. \u00a0True, we were that desperate.It's disappointing to see this place in such a low state because the Macaroni Grill was once stellar. As another reviewer stated we to felt cheated on the way out. Totally not worth the money we paid here.

At some point - records are lost - he and the dragon agreed to create a bread stove that emulated a wood-burning stove, but burned about 5 times hotter. The addition of dragon's breath to the baked bread created a concoction that was at the same time both delicious and mysterious.Sir Pizza and the dragon's creation - dragon-bread - took off as a hit all across Britain until King Constantine III exiled all dragon-wranglers throughout his kingdom. Thus, Sir Pizza found refuge in the city of Naples in the Byzantine Empire. There, Sir Pizza opened shop again and continued selling dragon-bread until his accidental choking death while trying to eat chocolate, strawberry and vanilla ice cream at the same time.The dragon itself died in 1127 and the Neopolitans were forced to find a way to make artificial dragon-bread, finally arriving on a tomato sauce/cheese concoction that looked and tasted virtually the same (but reportedly with less bite).The Neopolitans continued to make dragon-bread until 1390 when, during the Papal Schism, Pope Boniface IX ordered all references to dragons as real erased from all recorded history and ordered all tributes to dragons to cease. Thus, the Neopolitans were forced to come up with a new name for dragon-bread. While they considered calling it \"neopolitan-bread\", they decided instead to name it in honor of the bread's creator and thus it was called \"pizza\".This, of course, created a few more problems as \"pizza\" was at the time the name that strawberry, vanilla and chocolate ice cream had when they were in the same container. However, the neopolitans felt that since this name memorialized Sir Pizza's death, it would be appropriate to change the name of dragon-bread to \"pizza\" instead to celebrate Sir Pizza's life. In turn, they named the ice cream \"neopolitan\".Thus, from 1390 on, dragon-bread was known as pizza.Also, they have really good garlic bread here.", "location": "\nFranklin, TN\n", "exp": " 72 reviews", "date": "2012-08-29"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nDavid O.\n", "review": "Sir Pizza is like if you took a Pizza Joint and made it a Bar.It is probably the most \"Broke-Ass Pizza Place\" I've ever been to, with wall decorations that are circa 1970.

This little 24 seat authentic Guatemalan restaurant is a study in contrasts. It very much reminds me of small roadside eateries I frequented during my travels in South America many years ago. Pretty good pedestrian fare (not a slam--just a statement of the style of food served.)I set up a farewell dinner here (at the request of a friend who is leaving the area). When I approached the owner about having a large group all at once, she looked startled that I'd even ask to reserve a place (for 21 people). But...not to worry...she simply said she'd close the restaurant just for our group on the specified date. Whoa! She said, \"what?\" Yes, she did.The food is all hand-made; the Pupusas are the best I've had in Nashville--filled with an appropriate amount of cheese, or mixto, or loroco and cheese (reminds me a little of mild green onions). Beautifully crafted and nicely toasted.--Fried fish - you get da whole 'ting. Ample portion and crisply fried.--Guatemala Tamal de Recado..meh. Good flavor but very, very wet, steamed and served in the traditional banana leaf.--Fried sweet plantains - average - a tiny bit greasy.--Doblada (a hand-made tortilla folded in half - resembling a large empanada - stuffed with potato & meat; big and mild flavored. (Add some house-made picante sauce.)--Carne Asada, big portion with rice & beans on the side; a bit chewy.--Soup, a very hearty bowl popular with locals, is available only on weekends. -----Half of the remaining items on the menu, including Horchata...not available on any given day. You take your chances. Uh...that's not a very good business practice. (Therefore, my guests had to pick and choose and ask about what they could have for dinner.) Hit and miss.--Soft drinks (bottled) no alcohol or other drinks.--Price...astoundingly inexpensive! Light dinner for 2 - ten bucks.--Atmosphere - 2 TVs tuned to Latin stations, showing f\u00fatbol. A large fan blowing across the cramped room and A/C that could barely cool the corner where it came up through the floor.--Attitude of staff - excellent, congenial.

I'm not asking for anything exceptional at this point. I'm just tried of eating bad Chinese food. My mind is blown by the dismal choices in this city. Until now, Best Wok was my place of choice. It was meh, but better than most other places. This will probably be my new favorite. I would have given five stars if the soup had been better. Service was friendly. We were greeted by a young boy who was extremely cute and polite. He took our order and he was very professional. I liked him. We went with basics. sweet and sour chicken, General tso chicken, egg drop soup and an egg roll. The food came up quickly and we took it home. I like the containers, so that's a plus. I am a fan of the plastic ones I can reuse. Upon opening everything, it all looked very much like standard Chinese carry out food. I let out a sigh of relief. It looked and smelled good.The rice was cooked nicely, the chicken wasn't overly smothered in breading and everything tasted pretty good. The egg drop soup was way too thick. Too much gelatin. I know that can be preference, but I don't like it. I thinned it out with a package of soy sauce and that helped. I ate about half of the soup. The egg roll was interesting. It was really crispy and you could taste the greens in it well. It was a good egg roll. The fried rice was pretty good. It has carrots, peas, onions and egg in it. It's the really dark type of fried rice, which isn't my favorite, but my boyfriend liked it. I got the white rice and it was great. Perfectly steamed. You'd be shocked how many places I've been in Nashville that can't even get white rice right...So we had good service, fast turn around and decent food.

I traveled far for this and I was looking forward to a great first official Yelp mingling experience....This review is solely for the second half of this event, which was not the same as the first portion of complimentary bites or drinks, but it was to offer specials. This was great, nonetheless. I initially thought it would be a good spot to transition to the next event, and this was open to anyone. With that being said, that is exactly how it went. There was no designated spot. The only way you knew any Yelp related activity was happening is because you saw a few people carrying those Yelp bags that we got during registration earlier that day. Since I'm from out of town, I was just barely getting familiar with faces. If it wasn't for those bags, or the small Yelp group I was with, I would of thought this was like any random bar. And those specials that were listed in the RSVP calendar, those were the same as the regular HH prices at the bar for, again, anyone. The venue had nothing indicating Yelp. No where, no how.Also, I hate to bring this up, but even worse, I hate that it even happened. As we were all around the bar WITH our Yelp bags, we had seen a group at the door. I would of never know who they were, if not for one. They were seated and not once, looked over our way, came by, asked us how we were doing... nothing. This was not a good impression at all. I felt like an ignored middle child and even got pouty. Wah, wah, right? Well, I typically am not super sensitive but we came out here because this was part of an official YSB event yet felt like it was just any other bar in town doing HH.

I had been to Las Palmas once before and was underwhelmed. The service and food were fair to middling and the thing that stuck most in my mind was the nursing-home smell of whatever sort of disinfectant that they use to wipe down their tables. Fast forward to this afternoon.My wife and I entered a little after 3 pm. The restaurant was fairly slow; there were at most 5 tables seated upon our entry. It took several minutes for our waitress to come greet us and take our drink order. She walked up to the table and managed a surly \"what would you like to drink\" after I had smiled and asked how she was doing today. I received no response except an unamused look and a click of the pen as she waited to write down my drink order. No big deal, maybe she was just busy. When she returned with our drinks after another long wait, she spilled a fair amount of my margarita all over the table, paused long enough to shake the liquid off of her hand like a dog will shake after getting in water, and then walked off without a word. I was left to clean up the spilled margarita with the napkins provided with my silverware --napkins that were never replaced, even though I requested fresh ones twice. We sat for several more minutes before she returned to take our order. It was at this point I saw another server walk in the door and clock in. Then I realized what was happening: the shift change. The previous server obviously did not want to wait on us because she was getting ready to leave, hence the extremely slow service. The new server wasn't much better, but it wasn't her fault; the server who was leaving dumped all of her remaining tables on her and then the restaurant proceeded to get busy. At one point, I counted 8 tables that our server was attempting to wait on. Through it all, the other server on the floor, the hostess and the person I assumed to be the manager were oblivious to her struggle. My wife and I suffered with empty glasses for long periods.When we finally received our food, it was cold. I ordered the Palmas Fajitas and my wife ordered several a la carte selections. By the time our food arrived at our table, the cast iron skillet the fajitas are served on was not even lukewarm, much less sizzling; that's never a good sign. Since we had waited so long and were starving, we ate without complaint. Unfortunately we didn't see our server again for at least 15 minutes, long after I had finished my first three tortillas (yes, three is all they serve at a time). Rather than ask if we were enjoying our meal, she dropped the check and then said to pay when we were ready and she would bring me a box if I needed it. Incredulous, I asked if I might have a few more tortillas to finish my meal, as I had been waiting patiently for her to visit the table all this time. In short, even for Americanized Tex-Mex type cuisine, I cannot in good conscience suggest Las Palmas. It positively blows my mind that this place continues to be voted best Mexican restaurant in Nashville. The only way I can wrap my head around it is that it is the only Mexican restaurant in the area that is not in a sketchy strip mall or located in a \"bad\" neighborhood. Or perhaps, like Ese, they're remembering the Las Palmas of old. Or maybe Nashvillians are too scared to make the short trek to Nolensville Road to get some better food.

Good thing everyone else on I24 was going faster than I was.

Here's the rundown: An iceberg lettuce salad with a homemade gingery asian dressing. cup of miso soup with seaweed. (I will be leaving that off any future order. I guess I'm not a miso soup fan either). three pieces of vegetarian california roll. large portion of white rice. large portion of teriyaki chicken.

Don't know what it was about it, but there was just this flavor that was unpalatable. I had to set it aside and find some leftover chili sauce in the fridge to dip the potstickers in. that wouldn't have been that big a deal, but the teriyaki chicken for all the rest of its deliciousness did have some of that weird soy sauce flavor. unfortunately soy sauce is in so many dishes, and I don't like theirs.

Seriously, I gave up. Not worth it to me. So jump to a few weeks back and we're looking for late day breakfast and the only two places that are open are Ihop and Waffle House. My husband wanted something different so he suggested WH and I half laughed and said, \"Are you for real?\" I pulled out my trusty Yelp app and told him only if I find one with great reviews, so obviously I wasn't holding out. Lo and behold there was ONE and it had EXCELLENT reviews. We actually drove by 2 other WH's to get to this one and I had to keep telling the hubs to not pull into the first, most convenient one, that it would be worth it and it was!Our server was very friendly and we were greeted as soon as we walked in. Our drink orders were taken right away. We weren't ready to order yet but we had a 2 year old with us so to appease him we ordered a waffle right off the bat. It was made quickly and they even cut it into little toddler hand sized strips for him without us even asking. When we did get our food, everything was correct and was delicious! My husband never ran out of coffee which is a pet peeve of his. Our server's name tag said she had been with the company for over 25 years! Finally someone that knew what they were doing! We were almost finished and my son started to get restless and we noticed a kid's table with a coloring book and crayons nearby. This particular location has a lot of regulars and goes above and beyond! They addressed a lot of customers by name as soon as they walked through the door along with already knowing their orders. They deserve some kind of reward. Seriously. AND there were no kitchen fights! All the staff joked with each other and spoke like they were actually friends who enjoyed their jobs. If a mistake was made, no big deal. Correct it and move on. I've seen fights at other locations for not remembering to make a waffle. So ladies and gents, not all chains are created equally!

I was always under the impression that everyone passed the pipe around as is and if you know anything about me, you know that I don't do germs. But, life happens and I found myself at a hookah bar. When in Rome...So, thank goodness the REAL way to enjoy hookah is with your own personal mouth piece. Okay. I can do this. Well, I thought. I now know why Bill Clinton claims that he didn't inhale. Breathing in fire (willingly) is not a lot of fun. I know I am in the minority and people from all over enjoy smoking items of all sorts. For me, I'll keep my vices in liquid and food forms. It probably didn't help my case that I was smoking Blue Mist. If Breaking Bad taught us anything, it's that most things blue are made of crack... or, meth. And, they're probably not good for us.** So, smoking something called blue *anything* is probably not a good idea. And, judging by how out of control my new group was getting (oh, I didn't mention that I came here with strangers? Yeah. All day beer, wings, music, and more festival... bad decision jeans are all the rage), we probably made that point several times over.Since we were already smoking (not a sentence I use regularly), why not go all in with drinks and food? I kept things at 100 and ordered a Blue Brugada. What? I told you my bad decision jeans were on (and my butt looked good in them) and I was already smoking something blue. Why not go for the drink as well? Adding to the bad decision. It was $5. No good came from this... or, maybe, it was all good. I don't know. I have my kidneys. It's a win. Because things were spiraling, I went for the trifecta and went to town on the chicken nachos. I don't know whether they truly were the best thing I'd eaten that week or if I was well past the point of acceptable blue intake, but those nachos were damn good. And, at $10, a bargain for all the food you get with them. To finish things off, I demanded birthday cake from the (large) party who was celebrating. I may have danced with them as well. It's a blur. I blame the blue.But, I'd come back for more.*I'm pretty sure that's how things went.**That said, I will NEVER give up blue drink.

Evergreen also serves theirs with very little broccoli, but at least it's spicy and usually cooked properly. No steamed/fried dumplings?! Wahhh!

I'm a Panera Bread lover, so when I heard they were opening one right down the street from me I was pretty excited. Excitement has now turned to disappointment after the 2 god-awful experiences I have had there since it's opening! I went about 2 weeks ago through their drive-thru and I ordered a pick 2 with the Turkey Avocado BLT and a Chicken Caesar Salad (as is, nothing complicated). I wanted a baquett as my side and they said they were out of baquetts. You're Panera Bread, how are you out of bread!?!?!? I have never heard of such. So then I proceed to the window to get my order and the girl asks me again what I ordered. Apparently they had made me a Chicken Caesar Sandwich instead of salad. Why would I have a pick 2 with 2 different sandwiches!? That doesn't even make sense. So after waiting forever, they assure me they have included my salad and also gave me the Chicken Caesar Sandwich they accidentally made me. So I drive off but decide to check my order before I leave the parking lot and realize they didnt give me any dressing for my salad. So then I have to go back around and get in line again to get dressing. Finally I get home to eat my dinner, and I open up my salad to realize they put TURKEY on a CHICKEN Caesar Salad! I couldn't believe it. So then I figure I'll just eat the Chicken Caesar Sandwich they included instead. But I couldn't eat that either because the sandwich was DRENCHED in MAYO (which isn't even supposed to be on that sandwich) and the chicken on it was PINK!!! Wtf. Even my Turkey Avocado BLT was drenched in mayo, and it only had ONE strip of bacon on it. It looked like a disgusting mess! It was basically a $15 meal wasted! So I wasn't planning on going back, but today I remembered I had a free bagel on my Panera card that I've been needing to use. I decide to give this Panera another chance...surely they can't screw up a simple bagel order! Wrong. The lady I encountered at the window today could not figure out how to swipe a Panera card! She got extremely rude the moment I handed her my card and told her I had a free bagel offer I'd like to use. She immediately got flustered and started yelling repeatedly that my card was \"not processing.\" A minute later she hands me back my cards and food and says, \"Sorry about that,\" so I assume she figured out what the problem was, but then I look at my receipt and see that I still got charged for the bagel. So then I said, \"It doesn't look like it took off the bagel?\" And she gets real nasty and says, \"Yeah I told you your card could not be processed!\" This is all quite odd, seeing as how I go to other Panera breads all the time and have NEVER had any issue with my Panera card. Sounds like user error to me. Oh and I got home to realize they gave me the wrong cream cheese with my bagel LOL. Why am I not surprised.Basically to sum it all up, I will not be going back to this Panera, and I recommend you do the same if you would like to save yourself the annoyance and hassle of getting a simple meal. You'd think sandwich making isn't rocket science, but these people need at least a year to figure it out. There's a great Panera Bread on 21st Street across from Vanderbilt that always gets it right, go there instead.

Located next to a dry cleaners, Soy Teriyaki is pretty small, but it surprisingly has a fair amount of seating. Like myself, most people in the lunch crowd are office workers in the area. I was planning on ordering some Korean tacos, but after seeing bibimbap on the specials board, I knew I wanted that because it had more vegetables in it. I placed my order and received my number. Then I got myself a drink, and as soon as I sat down, the bibimbap was brought to my table. Wow! Fast service! Especially helpful for the rushing lunch crowd. The presentation was nice, and it looked like there was a nice balance of all food elements in the bowl (veggies, rice, meat, etc). One of my biggest pet peeves with bibimbap is when it is served with too much rice and not enough meat or veggies. Many places often skimp on the meat, but this bowl had a good amount of everything. Instead of serving the gochujang on the side, they put it on top, but after mixing everything together, I found it was the perfect amount of sauce.

The only negative I had with the food was my dish was topped with a fried egg that was definitely over-well. When I order a fried egg, I do so for the creamy yolk that can be used to sauce the dish. I guess next time I'll specify over-easy. 'If you're in Brentwood and are getting tired of Peter's...try Soy and you won't be disappointed.

And make sure to use that dipping sauce that comes with it, holy heavens just thinking about it makes me want some. *Commence drooling* I greatly prefer this gyoza to Peter's.The chicken and beef are cooked well (also better than Peter's in my opinion); juicy, tender, and the teriyaki sauce drizzled over them is so delicious.

Dark tables. Pretty popular with the locals.I don't remember seeing the owners, but my friends seemed to know him well enough to ask about him. Food is Asian fusion, and the flavors were definitely prevalent -- except in the salad. I started with the side salad, which was rather bland. I think it was finely chopped, marinated carrots on top of a few leaves of iceberg. But the dressing seemed to be missing. I didn't feel the need to return it, as I really am not much of salad person. I just eat it sometimes as medicine.I was hoping for the salmon teriyaki, but when I asked, I found out they remove the skin. I love salmon skin (which I know some people are weirded out about eating). I consider my salmon incomplete if it's not available.Instead, I had the \"chicken taco\" -- taco in the sense of a soft tortilla, rather than the crunchy, folded up kind. In contrast to the salad, the flavors were bursting. The chicken was not entirely seasoned, but the toppings definitely were. I detected a mixture of julienned daikon and apples with lots of kimchi-like seasoning. Not too much a fan of daikon.

The furthest I've ventured outside of SoCal was Vegas, which isn't much different whether you're sober or not. I'm not a critic, nor am I a pro at reviewing food. One thing I am good at, is eating. A \"foodie\" for sure. My fianc\u00e9e and I get word about places to go and things to do, by word of mouth. Obviously, we look to Yelp for reviews and such for local spots. But how can I express or share a place that's over 1200+ miles away??Yep. Brentwood, Tennessee. Typically, you associate foods to the genre of the location. I was obviously expecting some good home country cookin', but I didn't. Don't get me wrong, Cracker Barrel lived up to to everything country, but this place.. Oh man. We traveled quite a long way and we were hoping to just grab some good southern food. But when we were brought to Soy Teriyaki Bistro, we were kind of shocked. Asian bistro? In Tennessee? We flew all the way out here for.. Korean Taco's?? WTH?! I came with the mentality that the food trucks, restaurants and cafe's in SoCal were just the GOAT. \u00a0Well, I will happily admit I was wrong. The bubble popped. Simple comparison, KogiBBQ truck is just the king of all that is Korean Tacos. The short rib beef tacos are top notch, with the assortment of toppings that make for a flavorful bite. No doubt, my go-to for late night cravings. Soy Bistro's beef tacos are just ridiculously the same if not, better than my local favorite. The first two impressions after biting into the taco? The fresh tasting, real corn tortilla at the bottom and the wasabi mayo, fresh crispy kim chi, and a spicy kick on top. The marinated beef in the middle sucker punched my mouth, while I was smiling over the first two impressions. The chicken was just as awesome, but I preferred a second helping of the beef. I could've easily hoarded a half dozen more of these affordable beef tacos, but the simplicity of each hand made taco made me appreciate just having two. The owners and staff are genuine and friendly. They appreciated our business and positive comments. Soy Bistro is an active part of the community.

Whenever I fly back home to California on holidays, I usually stop by my favorite restaurants, rarely willing to try something new when I only have a few days to eat.I took the opportunity to try Korean tacos here at Soy Teriyaki Bistro and was pleasantly surprised. If you're looking for authentic Korean or any other particular Asian cuisine here, you will be disappointed. But if you keep an open mind and would like to try a fusion item, you may be pleasantly surprised as I was. I'm generally not a fan of fusion items--most Asian fusion restaurants sacrifice the best qualities of an ethnic cuisine (cough PF Changs cough). However Soy Teriyaki Bistro does the exact opposite and managed to pull it off quite well.We ordered a chicken taco, beef taco, and hawaiian bowl (fried rice with spam) + additional chicken. All three items taste nothing like I've ever eaten before, so it was quite a [refreshing] surprise to eat something so new yet so yummy. The meats are covered in teriyaki sauce, along with some veggies, a house ranch sauce, and pickled vegetables, all wrapped in a corn tortilla. I was surprised that the corn tortilla was not dry and 'crumbly' like most corn tortillas out there. Unlike most Asian fusion locations, the teriyaki sauce isn't too sweet.The hawaiian bowl did not need any additional meat items--the spam was enough meat even for a carnivore like me. The fried rice was a LITTLE greasy in the plate but it didn't taste greasy at all.Their website has all of their menu items and current prices. Don't come to the restaurant expecting to get your socks knocked off. Instead, come here and expect an interesting twist to your ordinary tacos with a little Asian fusion [that's done relatively well].I'll update this review once I try the Korean tacos in Los Angeles and see how they compare. ;-)", "location": "\nHouston, TX\n", "exp": " 116 reviews", "date": "2011-07-09"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nNicki R.\n", "review": "I absolutely love this place.

They know their product is good, so they don't have to make the effort to be nice to you. Soy Teriyaki Bistro puts all those other places to shame because not only is the food here stellar but this place is run by some of the nicest people you'll ever meet.STB is an unassuming place that is easy to miss, and from the outside it doesn't look like it's going to have much character; it's not fancy but it's not hole in the wall, so you'd be forgiven for assuming that you're going to get a pretty sanitized eating experience. You'd also wrong. Yes, the menu has salads and teriyaki combos, but if you're smart, you'll order yourself 2 or 3 of the Korean tacos. Having pledged my allegiance to the authentic taqueria tacos that generally only cost $1.25, I was skeptical at handing over $5 for two tacos. One bite and I was convinced: taste trumps authenticity, and these are the best tacos I've ever had. The chicken is very spicy and will make your mouth zing, while the beef is unctuous and has an addictive wasabi sauce on it. Normally I don't care for kimchee, but the STB tacos are laden with the stuff and I'm all too happy to get down and dirty to make sure I don't miss a single bite. Also, I normally order about 4 Mexican street-style tacos in order to feel full, but 2 STB tacos get the job done, so the price definitely seems reasonable to me. My hubby and I have also tried the spicy rice bowl and the Hawaiian rice bowl... yes it comes with pineapple and spam, and yes it is delicious! But be warned: you will have leftovers because the portions are huge!The tacos at STB are seriously crave-worthy. Don't be surprised to find your eyes glazing over a few days later as you think lovingly of your meal here and begin deliberately plotting your next return, I've experienced that enough to know it's totally normal. Best of all, the people working here are so friendly that you'll feel good about giving them your money. The man working the register seems to recognize most people (suggesting this place has a lot of regulars) and is really warm, welcoming, and just plain fun. Just to put things in perspective, on our last visit, my husband went to get some extra sauce and the chef addressed him *by name* and asked him how the food was... and we've only been there twice! When was the last time that happened to you when dining out? We were already believers but that attention to detail sealed the deal: the next time I'm jonesing for \u00a0Korean, you'll find me at STB!

He picked up a pad to take our order but never gave us the menus luckily because we eat at Waffle House frequently we knew what we wanted When our orders came out my husband was missing his bacon I asked for my hash browns to be in a ring and they were scattered his waffle looked jumbled up as if someone had scraped it off the waffle iron his eggs were over hard instead of over medium my toes look like bread with a hunk of butter on it as if it had not been cooked. The waiter proceeded to take the plates back so they can fix it as they stood in front of the grill and whisper to one another our waiter left the room and went to the back while the rest of the crew attempted to fix our order I was very nervous because I watch them look over at us and whisper I was concerned that the manager appeared upset that she had to refix our orders. So the orders came back out and my husbands order was still incorrect so we asked to speak to the manager. Our waiter went and got her she walked over with a scowl on her face and my husband pointed to the food and asked her would you eat this food looking like this and her response nastily was yes I would eat it just like that because I cooked it. , so we proceeded to tell her all the things that were wrong with our order and she blamed the waiter and said we cook the food the way it was written on the order that's his fault what kind of manager doesn't take ownership for a problem and blames her waiter. So my husband was cutting into the waffle and he made a statement I won't pay for food that is not the way I ordered it and in that moment she reaches over to grab the plate out of his hand and says well you need to go somewhere else and eat you won't be eating this food and tries to grab the plate out of his hand!!!

It may come from the fact that my Floridian Wife said Waffle Houses were perpetually full of Smoke, which for me is an immediate red flag. But that's ancient history, now that the Liberals have had their smoke-free way, even in Tobacco-friendly Tennessee. The Hotel I was staying at on the outskirts of Nashville had one of those poisonous \"buffets\" for breakfast, and with a WH adjacent, I finally took the plunge.The place is the Southern breakfast joint you'd expect. You sit at a counter, or at a few boothes that border the line kitchen. The staff is indeed all southern charm. Easy going, and just the right mood for the morning. The place smells of griddle, which is a good thing for a breakfast joint. But how's the COFFEE?It's great coffee-shop coffee. This ain't gourmet Starbucks-style strong-as-horse-piss brew. It's workingmans coffee. Everyday coffee. Satisfying coffee. What you want at the start of the day. Even to my Keurig-ordained palate, this was a fine cup of beans.On to the main course.I'm not a Pancake-Waffle guy for the most part, preferring a savory breakfast. But when in Rome...I ordered the special of eggs, sausage, grits and a waffle. The eggs were broken and scrambled in butter. I watched the fellow do it. No \"bucketful of egg-like stuff\" here. The Sausage was tasty, and the grits were the best I've ever had. The essence of corn. Then there was the waffle. Malty, and perfect. I could have enjoyed it without the de rigueur maple syrup and butter, but I went the whole shebang-albeit with a light touch.A fine fine breakfast, and light on the wallet as well.We ate at the WH every morning while we were there.I had to drive to Cincinnati from Nashville, with a VERY early start, and I was going to hit a Shoney's on the way, but when I got off the highway, there was a WH right there, and I thought I'd see if my experience was a fluke.It wasn't.

I'm a little behind on my reviews. Just a little. My husband and I were off on the same day. As I have stated in a previous review, this is a rarity. It was a Tuesday, because that's when the 12South farmer's market was. My husband had just happened to scroll through his Twitter feed and see that Riff's was there (we both had been at work on the Battle of the Food Trucks day and really wanted to try this one). I remember that it was like a little over an hour before the farmer's market was over because we jumped up from what we were doing and raced out the door. We were living in Hendersonville at that time, and I don't care what they try to say about it. It's not as \"convenient to everything\" as all of the apartment brochures and websites say...especially if traffic on Vietnam Vet is going slow. Oh man, I shouldn't have waited so long to review this. Ok. So we get there and we order. I got (what I'm pretty sure was called) the Roasted Vegetable Panini. It has mushrooms, squash, zucchini, and I think one other veggie, and it had some sort of spread on it. Now I can't remember what it was...if one of you out there happens to know, feel free to chime in on this review. All I know is that it was absolutely delicious. My husband got (again, I think) jerk chicken that came with roasted sweet potatoes and a corn/watermelon salsa that was surprisingly good. I was a little wary of the corn and watermelon combination, but it was really good. His chicken was also SO GOOD. The sweetest people run this truck, too. When we got there, their debit card reader went ballistic and just would not take our cards. We NEVER carry cash. Never. If we ever happen to have some on us, something might blow up.

Believe me, I love the idea. However, nearly every one I've patronized has been over priced, you wait forever for the food and when you finally get your food it's kinda mediocre. Such was the case yesterday with Riff's at Centennial Park. We got to the park later in the day. The only thing on the menu was burritos and tacos. Reading other reviews, I know you do others things besides tacos. I went for the fish tacos. I didn't want the pineapple salsa so I asked if they had any hot sauce. Puzzled at my request, the woman who took my order said they could put jerk sauce on the fish, which sounded great to me. So seven bucks for two tacos. During the nearly 30 minute wait I watched burritos being made. I saw plentiful helpings of chicken and brisket, rice and beans (mostly rice), gobs of pineapple salsa and some type of greens going into the burritos. At this point I'm thinking wow, if the burritos look as good, my taco should be great. Again, almost 30 minutes later, which is WAY TOO LONG to wait, my name is called and the guy hands me my tacos and says, ''Sorry for the wait (which was the standard line for everyone when they came up for their food). I made three orders of these before I remembered not to put the pineapple salsa on it\". I said, \"no problem' but, what I really meant was, 'what the hell took so long, it's just a couple of tacos?\". I start to walk away and look down at what I just waited a half and hour and seven buck for and it's just tortillas and two pieces of fish with this sweet jerk sauce on it. That's it! No garnishment what so ever! No slice of lime. Nothing! Seven bucks and a half hour of standing around in the hot sun for this?!? No, I didn't go back and complain. I was tired of waiting as were my wife and kids.C'mon, Riff's! You want to know how to make great tacos? Quit with the gourmet angle and go visit some taco trucks on Nolensville or Murfreesboro Roads. It's quite simple. You take two small corm tortillas, put a couple choices of meat on it, then cilantro and onions, a couple slices of lime and your done. Offer some hot sauce at the point the customer picks up the order. The same advice goes for Mas Taco. Quit trying to re-invent the taco. Oh, and charge half the price.

We stopped by the Franklin Farmers Market on Saturday morning. It's been a while since I've been to the farmers market in Franklin, I was surprised with how many booths and people were there. Anyway, we made our way to Crepe A Diem. They were easy to spot because of the red truck AND the long line. If a food truck has a line, you know it's good. We skimmed the menu and decided on getting a couple things and sharing them. We decided on the Louisiana crepe, which consists of Andouille sausage, provolone cheese, caramelized onions, and red pepper - Rouille sauce ($8.50). We ordered the garden sausage sandwich, local pork, spices and fresh basil, scrambled farm egg, sharp cheddar cheese on a croissant ($8.50). We ordered both sides, hash brown, potato au-gratin with cheddar and chives ($3.99) and cheese grits, 'Beaver Dam Creek' local stone-ground grits with parmesan cheese and roasted tomato, garnished with sweet local basil ($4.99). And if that wasn't enough, we got the cinnamon and sugar crepe, Hatcher Dairy butter, cinnamon sugar, maple syrup ($4.50). You can tell they really work fast in that truck, it didn't take but ten minutes maybe for all the food to come out. I've always thought that most food trucks usually charge more than one would pay in a restaurant. This might be because of the convenience of it, but I think Crepe A Diem's prices are spot on. You get QUALITY food and it's not a little portion either. This garden sausage sandwich was a monster. I really loved the pork sausage inside, it was seasoned well and paired well with the cheese. Same goes for the Louisiana crepe. The sausage in that was so flavorful. I'm not a huge fan of red peppers or onions but loved this. The sides were great as well. This hash brown is probably one of the best I've ever had. I like this thing better than most places french fries. And the grits, can you say 'cheese'!?

From what I've seen, the food truck market might have an edge on Nashville's brick & mortar scene wrt diversity. Maybe.What's not a 'maybe' is that CaD is serving up terrific food. I was hungry when I got to the truck so eating ASAP was on my agenda. I ran across their offerings at the 12 South Farmers Market and it just so happened that earlier I was chatting up the Hummus Chick (seriously. If you like hummus, find her; her product is tEh awesome\u2122) and she told me that the truck was featuring her hummus in the Java Sandwich. Sold. I wanted to buy some tubs of the hummus, but I had many errands to run before heading home and it was a particularly warm early autumn day. I don't know if hummus spoils but I didn't want to take a chance. What I did want to do, though, was eat a sandwich with that hummus. So it came to pass that I stood in front of the CaD truck... and did not order a crepe.However, I didn't choose wrong. My vegetarian sandwich was a rocking journey of flavor and newness. For all those who think that food truck cuisine is greasy, simple and pedestrian, I challenge you to eat from CaD and keep that mindset. I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich and the fact that it took a little bit (not long, just not instant) to prepare. It made me feel as though my order was special and made just for me. CaD has a seasonal menu so I'm guessing my Java is a thing of the past but I have enough trust in the brains behind the butter that the current savory and sweet creations are just as fantastic.

The meal started off very well as they had Justin Cabernet by the glass at a decent price of $15 so we order a couple of glass along with a ricotta meatball appetizer and salumi and cheese. The wine was good as was the meatball, but I have to say the meatball did not come close to what we expect from Moto. The salumi and cheese left a lot to be desired as I have had much better at lesser restaurants like Urban Grub, Saffire, and Adele's. I like all of these restaurants, but expected more out of il Mullion and maybe that was a mistake. I had the gnocchi with bolognese and had to add some Italian sausage to get some extra protein and my wife had ravioli with goat cheese vodka sauce. My gnocchi was very very good and the sausage was amazing. It was extremely hot so much so that I had to wait about 4-5 mins before I could start and it was extremely heavy in a good way so don't order it unless you are super hungry or want to carry a box home. The ravioli was very good, but really nothing to set it apart from any other decent vodka sauce you would get at a decent Italian restaurant.

Unfortunately, they're light years apart. Service was poor. They were too slow to clean the table. We had empty drink glasses sitting in front of us for an hour. We both ordered specialty cocktails- The New Old Fashioned. It was not good. Had a strong lemon flavor that was kind of bitter and not becoming of an Old Fashioned. Stuck with wine the rest of the evening. I began my meal with the ricotta meatballs, which were fine. Nothing mindblowing but well portioned and tender. Girlfriend began with the \"special\" chicken cream soup, which was the most flavorful thing either of us had all night. On to entrees. I had the porcini ravioli. I remember having this exact dish three years ago in Las Vegas. It was one of the richest, most flavorful pasta dishes I've ever had. I was so excited to learn it was on the Nashville menu. Unfortunately, it lacked any finesse and all I could taste was greasy butter coating my throat. My girlfriend's entree was where things really went bad though.

When asked about the house wine, a five minute lecture on vino followed, with the house Pinot Noir described as \"dirt\" and the house Merlot was described as \"fruitful.\" The problem? Starting off an evening of \"fine\" dining feeling ignorant and scolded doesn't lend to the ambience of the restaurant. Now I admit readily, I am not a sommelier. But I also sheepishly admit that I have sipped a glass of wine...or two. I enjoy a fruity Merlot and I love my \"dirty, dirty\" Pinot Noir. So a tongue lashing in front of a table of eight was more than uncalled for. To round out the picture, my friend also got a scolding for asking about the menu. No lecture. But a scolding she \"did got.\" As for the menu, the food at Trattoria Il Mulino was nice. The pizza's are plentiful, as are the bowls of pasta. The calamari was beautiful, the sausage pizza was delicious and the rigatoni was perfection. We didn't linger for dessert. The food was too ample. My best advice for dining at Trattoria Il Mulino? Spending over fifty dollars a person for a humiliating tongue lashing by the \"Waitress Nazi\", even for food that is great, just isn't worth it.

It was clear that this place was super inefficient. At a non-peak time (now it closes early, so this was like 4 or so) I walked right up to the counter and ordered a single order of fries, that's it. There were about 5 people waiting for their orders already, and I stood there for TWELVE minutes waiting on some fries. I asked the guy... I just had fries. That's all. I see them riiiight there. The cooks are literally doing nothing except waiting on beef to cook. I had no beef. Can I please just take my fries and go? The manager overheard me and shook her head as if for him to tell me no. Given that I was staffing this conference and extreeeemely tired and hungry, this pained me more than usual.The large seasoning and sauce bar after I got my yummy thick fries was pretty cool.

In front of you mounted on a wall , are your options of items to choose from. You get a little order sheet and a pencil to choose your options. Your choice's of bread (your basic variety), meat choices of chicken,turkey, meat and veggie (with them coming with two patty's per burger) A choice between a selection of cheeses and sides such as tomato's, onions and so forth. You can choose different meal options with some coming with a choice of sides being onion rings or Fry's. I chose a burger with Swiss cheese ( protein style) with onion rings ( I know) lol They also serve shakes with your basic flavors, as well as a small selection of beer and wine. My total came close to $13.00 and some change.It took about 10 minutes to get my food. It was presented deliciously appealing and piled high with a generous amount of onion rings.Everything (to me ) tasted lip smack-en fantastic! Quality of meat was there and the flavor was rock-en! The onion rings (with only the few I had) were restaurant quality which I honestly could have probably ate just alone. One minus however, was the annoying containers they came in that made it awkward to eat, they really need to have some normal plate alternatives.Overall, this is probably the best food joint for your buck here at Opryland with them delivering some pretty decent burgers and not lacking in portion of quality.

The fact that said burger, all half pound of it, was spat out by some cruel factory machine that turns pieces of cows into uniform disks that have the same surface texture as pressure treated lumber, four stars. The fact that apparently all burgers are cooked to well done regardless, two stars, but the fact that it wasn't a hockey puck, three stars.Now despite the fact that I am of the school that says that price and product should not inherently share rating stars, be prepared to shell out one eighth of a C note for your Stax. That is correct, you did read that right. One $100 will buy exactly 8 of these things. Steep, me thinks yes. If you're wondering how much that is, divide 100 by 8. There's your price. Ouch. For a burger, fries and a pint of soda. Me thinks you are paying for the lighting (non CFL), and the high ceiling with them bucks.To summarize: Would I buy again?

It was translucent and just tasted weird... The chicken satay was so-so. The chicken was much better quality than the chicken that was used in the coconut soup, but it wasn't incredibly impressive and the peanut sauce was so-so too. My husband got the Tiger Tear salad and Chicken Sanibel. As soon as the Tiger Tear salad hit the table, the scent almost made me throw up. I can't think of a polite way to put this, but it literally smelled like poop. It was disgusting. My husband took a few bites but couldn't stomach it. The smell was unbearable, and the beef was almost raw. I had to ask the server to take it off the table before I could begin to eat my food. The Chicken Sanibel made up for it though. Oh, it was sooooo good. I ate a bunch of it off my husband's plate. The chicken was cooked perfectly and so tender. The sauce was the perfect sweet spicy blended goodness, and I found myself trying to eat every single grain of rice that was left on the plate. I would definitely come back here again.

If not, go to Tokyo or Kyoto (or head into Nashville or Franklin if you want even better sushi).Long answer:I normally go to either Kyoto or Tokyo when I go get sushi to go in Bellevue. After seeing the reviews on best sushi in Bellevue, I decided to give Lemongrass a try. It is certainly not the best sushi in Bellevue and I would question any review from someone who states this. Unless they were having a bad night for sushi (and also a bad night for Thai a few months ago when I visited).My feelings on the sushi? It is marginal sushi, at best. If this is what people call the best, then they must think supermarket sushi is average. Perhaps I have just become too much of a sushi snob?The fish was fresh. The tuna was the worst of the bunch, as it was getting marginal. The salmon was very nice, as was the rest of the fish. The problem, however, is the rice. Rice is extremely important for good sushi and the rice here is most likely done far ahead of time. It was also cold, which is not a good sign. If the rice is refrigerated, it certainly is not fresh.I was fine with the sashimi that came with the meal, but with Tokyo only a few dollars more for an equivalent meal, I will not try again.

The Bangkok rolls were good too (like a chicken egg roll), but at $6, I'd pass because they aren't that good. For an entree' I ordered pad thai and also some pork lo mein for my mom.

Leave some of the back skin on them to hold them together during cooking but not an inch thick so they are hard to pull apart! The pulled pork was watered down - do not keep your meat warming in a pan of water! I think that didn't help the flavor any which was slightly less bland than the ribs. The sauce, which can be a saving grace to some ribs, was meh. Not bad, not good, just there. A bit too runny for me as I prefer a thicker sauce but I wouldn't have held that against them.
