3.5,Great late night Mexican/ Salvadorian,"El Tamarindo on Florida Ave has been around a long time- It now has sister resturants
The first attraction is that is stays open late-- very late 5 am on weekends?????
and in the summer there is outdoor seating.
The Margaritas are wonderful-any time of the year
as for the food, some of the lesser tried entrees are the best....
