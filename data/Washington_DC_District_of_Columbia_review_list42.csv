4.0,Best artisan pizza in DC,"We waited 40 mins after we were noted down for a table for 3. It was worth the wait. The place is small and uncomfortable, but you're here for the food. The service was good and our order was expedited as we wanted it, slowly, since we wanted to savor our cocktails(they make a mean negroni),the daily specials appetizers and...

4.0,...not quite up to Tom Siestema's review,"We went to Etto because of the excellent rating in The Washington Post. We weren't quite as impressed as Tom was. We entered the restaurant when it opened at 5 p.m., on a weekday, last of August 2013. Etto is very clean, open with plenty of light, a full view of the bar, and limited seating. It has about ten...

4.0,Peter Pasten Prevails again,"Dinner at Etto is a wonderful experience from the wine selections--get the server's advice--to dessert. Peter focuses on pizza and little fishies, but don't miss the other tastes. We started with Burata, which is a creamy mozzarella right from Italy, and moved on to two fabulous salads before biting into the Alla Romana pizza (its yummy even for me who...

4.0,"Tasty food but expect to wait, shout to be heard, and empty the bank.","We expected to have to wait at Etto and when we got there, we were told it would take about twenty minutes. An hour and twenty famished minutes later we were finally seated! We had several of the appetizers which were very good - the roast peppers and smoked cod were my favorites. Savor each bite though because portions are...

4.0,"Iberian ham to die for, not so great pizza","First off, order the SEX ON THE PLATE Spanish Iberico ham. Literally melts in your mouth. This place had a nice European atmosphere and very good, original wines. We had a bottle of the most expensive Sicilian wine you can get by the glass, and it was excellent - light, subtle, but lots of flavor. The pizza was a bit...

4.0,Lovely Dinner,"We went here a few weeks ago an had a really relaxing delightful dinner. The drinks are really strong (beware!) but our wonderful waitress actually let me taste a sip of a cocktail before I ordered it -- which was amazing. Our small salads and burrata were delicious and the pizza was great! They don't take reservations and the place...

4.0,Spectacular,"absolutely wonderful place
They don't take reservations, and it is a bit small, but don't let this stop you-
Meals are often small dishes, these are unique and superbly made. They also have fantastic (true Roman-style thin crust) fire-roasted pizzas.
I would highly recommend going there.",Etto,227,85,"August 12, 2013","Detroit, Michigan",/Restaurant_Review-g28970-d4570219-Reviews-Etto-Washington_DC_District_of_Columbia.html,5.0,42,"Washington, DC",dinningforfun
4.0,Skip the pizza and order the small plates,"Went for dinner with a group of friends. Got there early bcs I had heard that there were long lines. They were very accommodating to seat us early before everyone arrived. I have to say I am NOT a fan of the pizza. I We ordered 3 different kinds. I liked the taste of the tomato sauce (very thin puree)...

4.0,Fresh Italian on 14th St,"Etto is simply fabulous - a small but bright space that takes no reservations and seats about 40 - Etto is my new favorite Italian restaurant in DC.
Everything is fresh and fabulous - pizzas, salads and unusual combinations of vegetables give Etto a unique Italian menu. The menu changes daily allowing the chef to showcase local produce and experiment...
