4.0,Looks can be deceiving!,"We were staying at the Palomar hotel on P street, and arrived late in the evening. We strolled up the street and happened upon this pizza paradise.
It is situated below street level and looks like a run-down basement, but don't let that put you off. The pizza is amazing. The slices are huge and really reasonably priced. Five dollars...

4.0,Superb pizza at a low price,"I don't normally write reviews of eateries, but I am going to make an exception as this pizza place is quite simply - exceptional. 
Starting with the main event: the pizzas. The crust was superb, as were the toppings we tried, really very much a cut above your typical take-out. The charges for DC especially were also very reasonable.  ...

4.0,Best pizza in DC,"This place has the best pizza in DC, hands down. The slices are huge! and the cook them fresh when you order (about a 3 minute wait). In the evenings and nights this place is packed and for good reason.

4.0,Pizza rivels what I had in Italy,"Everyone is leaving reviews for the one on P St in Dupont Circle here..so I guess I will do it as well. I went to Alberto's after the club..and it was everything that everyone said in the previous reviews. Basement level..you had to take the steps down. I got a slice of the pepperoni and sausage..it was $4.95 a slice..but...

4.0,A slice of heaven!,"No tables. No candle light dining ambiance. Location is at basement level. Restaurant is maybe 20 feet wide. Nothing about Alberto's Pizza is shwanky or up-market.
Except one thing -- the pizza!

4.0,We didn't feel well the next day,"This pizza was thick a gloppy. I'm not sure how else to describe it. We had actually gone into the pizza place across the street initially. It was too crowded, and we didn't feel like waiting. We noticed Sento's across the street, and no one was in there (we should have known why). There were two people working in there...

4.0,A new fav,"Top 5 favorite pizzas. Very good. One slice is a quarter of pizza and everything was good. Sauce, cheese, crust were all perfect. I would definitely go back!

4.0,Best in Town!!,"Alberto makes a real ""gourmet"" pizza - the best in the city! The crust is tender and crisp, the toppings are always fresh and he offers a very interesting, imaginative menu of toppings from which to choose.
His pizzas are truly addictive! Try one, you'll like it!

4.0,Great late night pizza!,"If you're near Dupont Circle and need a late night pizza fix, this is the place for you! I'm pretty sure they are open 24 hours and the pizza is DELICIOUS! It is a very small little pizza ""joint"". There are a few stools at a long bar if you care to sit down. We ordered and took it back...

4.0,Alberto's Pizza,"Don't miss out on this special treat. The sign out front says ""Caution, may be addictive"". Boy are they right. Some of the best pizza I've ever had. This is not a sit down restauarant. It does have a stand-up bar for eating but most get pizza to go. Buy by the slice. Portions are huge. Especially popular after hours...
