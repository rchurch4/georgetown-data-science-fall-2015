We showed up at out reservation time and gave the hostess the name we put it under earlier, and they said they didn't have us down at all. Then they seated us and a waiter came up and started addressing our table and then was rudely interrupted and intercepted by another waiter by saying \"I know my tables\". After he claimed our table, he then took our drink order and when we all ordered waters, he rudely said \"Bueller, Bueller, Bueller.\" The best part of this meal occurred when my family and I got up in order to serve ourselves at the salad bar...During our waiters introduction, he said that he would bring cheesy bread, garlic mashed potatoes, and fried bananas during our meal. We then got one of the three sides. Then we asked for them twice when they didn't serve the rest of the sides. During the meal when the meats came around, my mom asked for medium rare and got a piece of meat that was cold to touch and purple when she cut into it. Once we'd finished all of our food, the absent waiter came to our table with the mashed potatoes and fried banana only for us to say we were done and wanted to see what deserts they had to offer. Granted, the manager came by and asked about the meal and we told them our experience. She then took $25 dollars off and provided a dessert and cheesy bread to go. However, the cheesecake wasn't even presentable. With all the things mentioned before, I urge you to not spend your time or money after having such a great experience in the Texas de Brazil in Memphis, TN.", "location": "\nFranklin, TN\n", "exp": " 3 reviews", "date": "2015-10-10"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nJasmine M.\n", "review": "Got a Groupon and off we went! We went on a Monday evening where Happy Hour was still going (ends at 6pm). The buffet was nothing to brag about except they had a great selection of veggies. The lobster bisque was rich but it just didn't compare to some I've had in the past. All we had were beef and lamb. The lamb chops were delicious and the beef flank seemed to be the tastiest. The husband devoured the sausage. Wait staff was great! They didn't seem to rush you and actually gave pointers on how to pace yourself.

Try a little bit on your beef.If they're serving lamb (leg or chops), get some mint jelly on it. You will thank me.Skip the beers, maybe have some wine. But the best drink will be soda water. Not Coke. Soda water. It's coke without the syrup. Just bubbles. Very helpful for digestion!Don't skip the salad bar. There are some real winners up there, including the beets, the mozzarella balls and the hearts of palm.Don't give up too soon. If you feel full, wait a little bit. You'll get a second wind.They sometimes have a Groupon posted where you can save $20 for two dinners.With the roast pork, try a bit of the plantains on your fork.

I've never went out & ordered a steak at a restaurant, I'm not sure why, I just enjoy chicken & seafood more. Why would I come to a Brazilian steakhouse that has men walking around with meat on skewers? Well I was invited to dine here with a restaurant reviewer, & I thought it would be something different to try. The restaurant is very nice. It's upscale but I don't feel like it's putting on airs about it. All the staff I encountered were very friendly. Our server was nice, but almost robotic in his description of the food & the concept. Speaking of the concept, you sit down & first are able to pick what you'd like from the salad bar. Then once your done you flip a red card over to green, this indicates to the meat men that you're in the market for some meat. I had a \"Brazilian Allure\" cocktail that had vodka but tasted mainly like cotton candy. It was super sweet. Too sweet for me. It was $12. Salad bar, I would call it more of a cold bar, they had lettuce yes, & dressing but other than that there isn't really anything that I'd put on a salad. They have artisan salami & cheeses, olives & even some hot rice & white wine saut\u00e9ed mushrooms that were great. Onto the meat. I ate probably more than I should at the salad bar because I could've left then & been fine, but the meat was a calling. I could smell it. It's not hard to notice it because at any given point there isn't about 4-5 guys walking around with the stuff. This isn't a place to bring a vegan or vegetarian because the meat smell is everywhere. Along with the meat, your server brings you mashed potatoes & fried banana to \"cleanse your palate\" as he told us. I tried the flank steak, garlic beef, Parmesan pork chop, Brazilian sausage & another meat that I cannot remember. Everything was hot and tasted fresh. If I was a red meat lover I would've been in heaven, but I enjoyed trying it all. After you've stuffed yourself with meat, the server brings by a tray of the different cakes & pies they have. The dessert is the only thing you're allowed to take home with you. I sampled the carrot cake and the bananas foster pie. Both were good but I wasn't blown away by them. I suspect they aren't made in house. The price. For salad bar only its 24.95, & if you want the meat & the salad bar it's 44.99. I think it's pricy, granted it's all you can eat, but again, I'm not a huge red meat eater.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 383 reviews", "date": "2014-12-17"}, {"rating": "1.0", "name": "\nMark T.\n", "review": "I left the previous feedback on their corporate website.

For the location and restaurant; I love the spot, great access to the park, and near several great music venues for making a night of it, but the restaurant and bar areas, are a bit smaller than most Texas de Brazil's, which take away some of the grandeur of the experience. It felt a little hotel-ish, if you can draw a visual to that. The bar; again is kind of small, but it fits well into the space. The wine vault / cellar is beautiful and well stocked. They also carry local bourbon \"Corsairs\"; though none of the staff seem to realize what they have.The salad bar is the centerpiece, and well displayed and efficient. The Lobster Bisque was amazing!

I was so pleased to learn one had opened in Nashville so we could celebrate my birthday there. The restaurant is beautiful and in a great area of town. BUT...we never had a chance except to have two glasses of Malbec at $10 a glass sitting at the bar. As we arrived, parking was crazy! We could not make the turn off of Elliston/West End as the cars for the valet were backed-up to the light. Parking was for both Kobe Steakhouse and Texas de Brazil. We waited in the line about 5 minutes and saw a spot by the park, deciding a good walk after dinner would be nice.Upon entering, a very young hostess greeted us by saying her reservations were all running late and we would have to wait 20-25 minutes. We could see empty tables and since this was a Sat night, thought somewhat odd. Well, we waited about 15 minutes and another hostess approached us addressing us with the wrong name. She admitted she was confused and went on with her hunt. At that point my husband confessed, \"It took three times calling for me to make the reservation. I was hung up on once, there was no answer and I then finally got someone.\" As we sat at the bar, I noticed a staff member come from the back with a small cardboard box that was torn open. A bartender took three or four small fluted glasses directly out of the box, without washing, placed them on a tray, filled them and a waitress picked them up to serve to a table in the back. OMG! \u00a0After witnessing this, I approached the hostess. I advised her about what I had just seen and questioned her, \"we've been waiting over 30 minutes since our reservation time. When will we be seated?\" She only offered they had just opened. I replied, \"You guys have been open at this location for at least two months....with good reviews. You have locations in multiple cities.\" The hostess could offer no suggestion when we would be seated. I noticed that a table of guys behind us, although they were seated when we arrived still had not been served. They did not appear too happy! However, a table that was seated with apologies shortly after we arrived were enjoying their meal. We waited another 20 minutes with no one offering to seat us, merely smiling at us from the hostess station. The crowd at the hostess station was changing but it's unclear if they were being seated or leaving due to the wait. However, my husband indicates a large party was seated after we arrived. Being frustrated my husband made a reservation at another restaurant. Upon leaving a bartender bumped into my husband and he was so grumpy at this point, kept walking out the door. I mentioned to her we had waited over 45 minutes WITH \u00a0A RESERVATION, looking at that empty table in the corner the entire time. THEN she offered to seat us! I kept walking... at least the chilly walk back to the car served to calm us down after such a frustrating experience! Thank you Texas de Brazil for such a nice birthday surprise! LOL. The moral of the story, make a reservation at another restaurant as a back-up plan... don't \u00a0wait like we did and have your celebration spoiled!

I took a chance on most of it, even the stuff that no one touched and liked about 30 percent of it.

I get that TDB is a five star and Rodizio is 4, but I'll take a bigger selection of 4 star than a sparce and chancy selection of 5.Our server, Isac (if I spelled it right) was great, but we did not like the way that his peers addressed him, in a dismissive kind of way and the only thing we could see that he did is have a medical disability. Based off of that I really don't want to go back there. I literally watched a guy hold out his hand and not look, like he was too good, and hold his hand out and wait for Isac to give him the water pitcher, and when Isac walked away he looked as if he was given something below him that required inspection. On multiple occasions I saw the other waitstaff walk away from our server Isac while he was in mid sentence. Someone else came back to reaffirm our request for a different meat after we told Isac and he said he would get it for us. The guy didn't have a problem speaking, serving, or remembering what we wanted. He was attentive to our table and was able to explain the complete \u00a0menu.

They are deep-fried, not pan fried, which surprised me, but was an okay change. I thought they were a little too done, but the filling was quite tasty.

A bottle of Sriracha fixed that quickly. Upon checking with our server at the end of the meal, she told me that the customer should specify their preferred level of spice when ordering, I guess that means they don't prompt you and make it bland if you don't tell them otherwise.

So we passed this place running errands this afternoon and thought, \"hey, I've never noticed that there before by the tunnel?\" So after a few stops, we head into the parking lot to scope the place out. I jump on Yelp on my phone to check the reviews. Solid reviews... no terrible ones... oh and a Yelp special discount! Oh damn... weekdays only. So we go inside, past the walls of bamboo and have a seat at a table (No booths BTW). Our waiter comes over pretty quickly to get our drinks and greet us. I notice that the sodas on the drink menu used to say \"no refills,\" but the \"no\" has been marked out. The blonde orders a Dr Pepper, and I (the heathen) order a Coke. They bring out a full, iced glass for both of us AND unopened cans of Coke and Dr Pepper!?! WOOHOO! Coke with a Coke chaser! It's the little things that thrill me. After all, if my waiter keeps my drink full, everything else can be crappy and I will still tip at least 20%. We all look over the menu trying to decide what to get. The Vegan orders the Yellow Curry w/ Tofu. The blonde orders the Pad Kee Mau with chicken (Drunkard Noodle). I order the String bean w/ chicken... hold the Jesus. We also got a couple fresh spring rolls. While not the best fresh spring rolls I've ever had, they were pretty good... not as flavorful as say, King Market or PS Noodle Pot. So the food comes out shortly after we finish the fresh spring rolls. Good portions across the board. We all start to chow and remark how great each of our dishes are. So we then start trying eachother's food. Seriously... some of the BEST yellow Thai curry I've ever tasted. The drunkard noodles were amazing too. And of course, my string bean chicken was awesome. The service was excellent throughout the meal. We had both a waiter and waitress come around for drink refills and status checks and everything. Not pushy, but very attentive and the type of service that just made you feel welcome. Noticed several people come in to get carryout while we were there.

I could see taking my extended family here as well, 10-12 people sharing dishes. And I'm curious what the chef would do if we ordered a \"regular Thai feast\" in advance. We did that once as a group at Smiling Elephant, and it was revelatory.We wandered in on a very hot Saturday afternoon, and the atmosphere was cool and pleasant. Were immediately greeted warmly, told to seat ourselves - the seats, by the way, are comfortable even at my wife's petit height.The chef himself came out when my wife ordered \"Thai hot\" to make sure she meant it - and for the very first time in Nashville, she was served something truly Thai hot. I asked about Yum Woon Sen, one of my absolute favorite bean thread salads that was not on the menu, and he assured me he could make it. What came really didn't bear much of a resemblance to any YWS I'd had before, anywhere in the world, and though the basic cold noodle salad with some veggies and chicken and shrimp was all right, it was a bit disappointing when I'd been expecting something else. My own personal test of Thai restaurants are the Larb Gai and the Tom Yum soup. His Larb Gai was fine, though nowhere near as delicate as Smiling Elephant's. And at a requested \"seven hot\", it was really really spicy. Almost too much, obscuring the taste of the food. I don't know how Smiling Elephant manages to do lethally hot dishes and retain their delicacy and taste, but this restaurant could use a bit of help in that direction.Service was fine, the girl serving was pretty young but nice. She didn't check back with us at all, though; we had to find her to ask for the check, or motion from across the room to catch her eye when we needed something.

I've been to Morton's in Nashville and Sullivan's in Austin, so while I'm no aficionado, I did know what to expect. Ruth's Chris is a chain and while it's nice, I'm sure local-lovers and Steakhouse experts would know more of why that would matter.For those not familiar with such an establishment, know this: there is likely to be little available at Ruth's Chris that you will find unfamiliar. It's traditional steakhouse fair presented with an almost manic sense of understatement. Their steaks are served a la carte, as is almost everything else including sides. This is typical for this type of place. You're supposed to feel like your steak is a Cadillac and your sides and salads are expensive options you add. I wouldn't buy a car with air conditioning sold separately, but I don't drive an expensive car.The good: Portions are generous and everything that hit the table was high quality. Our salads were great, fresh and tasty. My Chop Salad was like a wonderful cole slaw with blue cheese. Steaks were seared with a flavorful crust of char, creepy tender, and cooked to temp-perfection. I had a NY strip and devoured it greedily. Cocktails were surprisingly creative and tasty, and their wine list was large if somewhat over-priced. Service was good and the ambiance was nice and pretty comfortable.The less-good: I just don't get the value proposition of Steakhouses like this. My strip was $46. By itself. Sure, it's all about quality, but making something outrageously expensive doesn't make it taste better. Adherence to traditional Steakhouse means limited choices outside of steak. The dining room's climate control was off- there was a period where it was sweltering and then abruptly cooled off. Likely an unlucky moment. Valet park- don't even dream of self parking at this location.So there you go. Steakhouse regulars will complain that I'm complaining about Steakhouses in general.

For the details, continue on...I took a trip here alone to see for myself what this restaurant was capable of. To get a fair idea of how the food quality and taste was, I ordered a variety of different things (and spent a heck of a lot of money!). But that's OK, because I went in prepared to spend to enjoy myself.I ordered the Lamb Chops for $40, the Lobster Macaroni and Cheese side for around $16, and the Creamed Spinach side for around $9. For dessert, I had the Bread Pudding for around $15 (or somewhere around there). Based on the price and the reviews, I was expecting a 5/5 experience for each and every dish, but this expectation for excellence and perfection did not necessarily hold. Oh, it was definitely good, just not as good as I had psyched myself out to believe. The lamb chops were cooked pleasingly tender and I loved how the edges were burnt just right to add that bit of charcoal flavor to the meat and fat. However, I could not taste the mint, and the overall flavor impact was not there. I felt like it needed something to make it less bland. For $40, I should not be thinking this at all. The lobster macaroni and cheese was delicious, but again, the cheese was runny and rather bland, and the flavor did not \"pop\" the way I was hoping. The creamed spinach was OK. It seemed like a very simple side; there was nothing fantastic about it. I found myself thinking that each spoonful was costing me $0.50 instead of how wonderful it was. Finally, the bread pudding is what made my night. It was easily the best tasting dish of all my courses and had the best presentation. The service here was something I admired greatly. My waiter stood in a corner monitoring all of his tables to see if they needed anything immediately. Because he was overlooking multiple tables, I didn't feel awkward or singled out. In between courses, my waiter arranged the plates and glasses in front of me to best suit my reach. He would also scrape any crumbs off the table with some sort of flat instrument; that was a unique experience.

I don't think they are made fresh? But it was good. Along with my steak I had the lobster mac n cheese which was devine. Yes, that's a lot of food for one person! The server was surprised at how much I ordered. But, I LOVE to take home steak from a good steak place and have it cold the next day. It's my secret guilty pleasure.

No big deal. But everyone that came to my table called me Mr M______ all night long. By the end of the meal that just became annoying. I know they were just trying to make me feel special? But I've been to other Ruth's Chris spots where they did not do that to me. It's minor, but like I said was a bit annoying all night. Having said all that, I would probably give it 4.5 stars if I could. If I'm in a town with a Smith & Wollensky I would prefer to eat there. They have better appetizer and side selections I think. But it is really the steaks that draw me in and I did have a perfect one. And, again, great service (other than the over the top Mr M_____ nonsense).

The meal took two hours because of how long she disappeared for each time. When she finally showed up, she asked questions like, \"how are we doing?\" instead of \"would you like dessert?\" so that we had to ask for dessert, then ask for a dessert menu, because apparently bringing a dessert menu to people who say they want dessert isn't the obvious next step at this fine establishment.The sea bass I ordered was AWFUL. Fishy, old, and overall just bad. Their spinach au gratin is the exact same thing as their creamed spinach, just with cheese on top.

We were looking forward to a delicious steak the whole week. We knew that we could definitely get it at Ruth Chris because of the experience we had with the one in Virginia Beach. We celebrated our 3rd Anniversary there and everything was exquisite! So we went ahead and made a reservation to eat at 7:15pm. We got there and there were a lot of people standing outside waiting for the valet to get their vehicles. Not a big deal, it's Saturday night in Nashville. We waited approximately 5 minutes to hand my vehicle over to the valet and proceeded down to the restaurant's hostess, whom had a pleasant smile. We arrived right on time ready to be seated. Unfortunately our table wasn't ready. What's the point of a reservation if you are not going to get your table at the time prescribed. Especially at a pricey place like Ruth Chris. Anyway, we had to go wait/stand in the bar area. Needless to say, my wife wasn't very happy. We waited about 10 minutes before they came and got us. This place is nothing like the Ruth Chris in Virginia Beach. It was very crowded. It's as if they put so many tables in the place that it has become a fire hazard. We are literally sitting elbow to elbow with the other patrons. Our waiter came to get our drink order after about 5 minutes of us being seated, which is average I guess. We know the service is always good at Ruth Chris but we could care less. We were looking forward to the STEAK. Well, we placed our main course order. We both went for the \"sur and turf\". Which was lobster and ribeye or filet. I had the filet and my wife had the ribeye. This is where our experience went south. Our steaks arrived at the table on a sizzling plate as usual. My wife asked for her steak to be cooked medium. I asked for mines to be cooked medium well. Our steaks were overcooked. So overcooked they were tough and inedible. My wife literally left three quarters of the steak on the plate. Yes we could have most likely send them back but thats not something we usually do. This is definitely telling in a restaurant where most patrons come for the steak. The filet was like a small hockey puck. It was almost like it was meant for a little kid. (wish I knew). Our waiter was very good though so didn't blame him for the food. We went ahead and left him a $30 tip on a $185 bill. Oh, we did get a complimentary dessert since it was our anniversary.

It is a steakhouse, not a bar.For my 1st course, I had the lettuce wedge. The Bacon crumbles on the lettuce were thick, charred and greasy obfuscating the light and healthy aspects of the salad. Then again, it's not a salad bar. It's a steakhouse.I ordered a steak and seafood combo that was featured that night. 6 oz filet, shrimp, and scallops. The food came out sizzling on a 500 degree plate. No, I'm not kidding, I researched this (after the fact) and found out that the plates are actually heated to 500 degrees. As I was eating my meal, I could see the pink of the steak nearest the plate slowly turning brown as the steak continued to cook in front of me. Unfortunately, I did not eat the shrimp the second the plate was set before me, and by the time I ate the first one it was tough and rubbery - a clear sign it was overcooked. by the time I got to the 3rd shrimp, it was a super-ball. Not a seafood house, a steakhouse.So while I would like to rate this place higher, sacrificing 1/2 the meal for the showmanship of a sizzling steak is inexcusable.

I have no time for parking, there is feasting to do!2. The hostess was incredibly friendly and professional. Happy to see a restaurant that hires an adult and not a 15 year old, indecisive cheerleader (no offense former cheerleaders). Our table was ready a half hour before our reservation. (it should be noted that we arrived upon the 5pm opening for a 5:30 reservation. yes it's early to eat, but we had a concert to see dammit!)3. The bar's decor, hell the whole place's decor, is soooooo warm and comforting. Dark wood, white linen, candles, grey bricks. It's a an enormous embrace of a restaurant that welcomes you, tells you, \"you're home now, I'm going to feed you SO well\".4. The bartender, Kim: THANK YOU for pouring me a drink. No stupid jiggers here. I ordered Jack on the Rocks with a splash of Coke; and y'all, that's what I got. She presented me with a hefty rocks glass filled to the brim with light amber perfection. I'm guessing there was between 2.5-3 full shots of booze in my glass and mayby 1/2 oz of Coke. It was a tingly burning masterpiece of a cocktail.5. Our server, Thad: Patient, outgoing, insightful, knowledgeable... He was good. I didn't find him incredibly friendly, but he didn't need to be. He was efficient, made great suggestions and was there when we needed him. I don't have to have a hyper, \"thank you thank you thank you\" server all the time. I dug Thad, and Thad made a monster tip from our table. 6. Okay, the food.... The lovely assistant ordered a pre-constructed full meal instead of ala carte, so she was the only one who got a salad. Some wild micro-greens, tomatoes (cherry and beefsteak), some red onion petals, a white cheese (feta?), and a vinaigrette that made your tongue physically leave your mouth and punch you in the mush. Excellent.6a. Enough about bunny food (awesome as it was), we came for dead cows. And brothers and sisters, we got 'em. Thad came to the table and rightly so, served the ladies first. A filet-mignon with shrimp for my girl, a ribeye and a filet sans-shrimp for the others. 6b. The ceramic plates are kept in a 500 degree oven until service time. They drop your steak on the plate, hit it with a huge glop of butter, then sprinkle with parsley. The aroma of the table is killing me. 6c. Now we serve the fellas; a bone in Ribeye and a NY strip for my buds. I, too, got a NY strip. You may wonder, what is the spice mixture, marinades, secrets of this place to make the best steak you've ever had? Well, I\"m going to tell you. Get a pen and paper. Ready? okay..... Salt and Pepper. Yup, that's it. Salt and freakin' Pepper are the only spices that hit your steak (minus the parsley at plating). Start with perfect meat, and you'll get perfect steaks. That's what Ruth's Chris does. Season, Sear, Serve. I love you guys.6d. Oh, we had side stuff, too! Mushrooms that we can't replicate here... I'll figure it out eventually. Garlic mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, asparagus with hollandaise, they were all great. And lest we forget that one side item is more than enough for two people. Fresh bread with real butter was also present at our table. Ah, gluttony. Eat your heart out Henry VIII.6e.The couple on my right ordered a Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e (how about some props for the appropriate accent marks, huh?) that was not only gorgeous, but incredibly delicious. The flavor had an odd habit of continuing to improve in your mouth, even after you'd swallowed your bite. Peculiar, in a \"Yes, please replace my blood with that stuff\" kind of way. The lovely assistant and I split the Bread Pudding with Whiskey Sauce. Cool whiskey sauce, warm bread pudding went to war in my mouth... it was, it.. was... divine. Yes please, may I have another to use as a pillow tonight? and forever?Oh, Ruth's Chris, I hated to leave you. But an equally magnanimous concert awaited, so I had to bid you farewell.

However, I doubt we needed to plan that far ahead. All of us got steaks and no one complained about their preparation. The spoon full of hot butter on top of each and the scorching plates are always present. The aged beef selection that they use results in a really tasty steak that you just can't find many places.

I always start with the wedge with bleu cheese. I've had the ribeye and the fillet and both are excellent. I prefer the deeper flavor of the ribeye, but their fillet is really top-notch for a lean cut. In fact, their fillet is more flavorful than any cut of steak you'll find almost anywhere else.

For those of us who like a salad, appetizer, entree, side, and one or two deserts, you're looking at around $80 - $100 per person. Wine will bump that up, as always.Still, that's cheaper than you will spend at other steakhouses with the same quality of food, which brings me to the most important part: the food.Amazing.

I found a nice shiraz there when I ordered a big steak. As usual, any steak you get there is amazing. They are cooked just right, and their butter gives just that extra flavor to compliment the steak's own flavor. Their sides are huge. I recommend that you order 2 or 3 and have everyone at the table share them.

For dinner we had 3 filet's and my younger son and I split a porterhouse for 2.

The filet side was perfect. \u00a0When Jamie came by to check on us i pointed out the fact that i needed to be a surgeon to eat the strip side \u00a0he leaned over and said thst it looks like just one piece \u00a0 I managed to get around it but it was not what i expected \u00a0For sides we got mashed potatoes. These are great but swimming in butter. Tasted great but if I knew they would be so doused with butter I would have gone for a baked. The asparagus was done perfectly and the creamed spinach excellent. For dessert we all split 1 chocolate lava cake ala mode and one American cheese cake. In retrospect I would have order something else instead of the cheese cake. To me NY cheese cake should be firm and this was not, it was also overly sweet. The chocolate cake was everything you would expect. We passed or coffee and got our check. The total before tip was $357.00 and other than the porter house issue the food was great.

Hands down.Since I live around Nashwood (that line where Nashville and Brentwood meet), I don't feel the need to venture all the way out to Downtown or Brentwood (lazy!) to get my sushi fix.

Our stomachs were famished after walking around shopping and catching up making fun of the folks we had the complete misfortune of going to high school with.

We can't be in two places at once!Friend: Haha, I'm hungry..just anything!(went on for a few more minutes until we settled on Sushi Me)Yeah, the longer we talked, the more we starved ourselves. Smdh first world problems.When you step inside, you get a modern Asian vibe with all the red, white, and black. Classy, but still casual. A full bar is there if you want your alcohol fix with a TV for sports watching.We were seated at a table and were completely overwhelmed by the sushi menu with pictures. Indecisiveness of several choices doesn't suit well with me, especially if I want to order the whole menu...which is my dream goal. Someday, it'll happen!Service was good.

I opted for my most basic Japanese meal, starting with edamame. Unfortunately, it was awful. It seemed these beans had been allowed to ripen too long, and when boiled (or steamed) they were just too soft and lacked flavor. For the first time in my edamame history, I did not finish the bowl.I also ordered the veggie roll, in which the description stated the roll would consist of avocado and cucumber. When my plate arrived, only four of the six had avocado in them and asparagus had been added to compensate for the veggie MIA. It still tasted alright, but I wasn't thrilled that I had not been served what was \"promised\".My table mates seemed to enjoy their meals alright with clean plates all around.

I wasn't amazed. I ordered some pretty basic rolls: tuna, spicy tuna, and yellow tail. I also ordered an order of salmon sashimi. My sushi wasn't bad.

However, I wouldn't drive out of my way to eat their rolls again. The other girls each ordered two or three rolls and then shared them amongst themselves.

I sat there for a bit observing another table being difficult due to some miscommunication. After probably five minutes, someone came by and offered to get drinks as our server was tied up with that issue. No biggy. Waters/drinks were slow to the table. Ok, still had plenty of time. Some bread was dropped at the table but we let her know we couldn't eat it so she could give it to another table. The friend (who has Celiac's) found a pasta that looked good on the gluten-free menu but was concerned that the bacon might be the same they use in all the other dishes, in which case it probably wasn't gluten-free. She made it a point to ask the server and was assured \"We can't put it on the gluten-free menu unless it's totally gluten-free.\"The food comes out fairly quickly. My roommate had the Absolut pasta which was good. I had the Seared Ahi Tuna Salad and asked to take off the crunchy noodles and glazed pecans and substitute avocado but was told she would have to do a charge on the avocado and couldn't substitute it for anything (that's a silly rule). The tuna steak was delicious but there was hardly any avocado on there. It was the equivalent of one slice. I finish my salad pretty quickly and set it off to the side. And it sat there. And sat there. And sat there. As did an empty drink glass and empty water glasses. The waiter had stopped by quickly to check if everything came out okay shortly after the food was dropped at the table and then we didn't see her again until it was about 7:20 (the movie started at 7:30). We asked for a to-go box and the checks. She walks by the table 4 times without either of those and as far as we could see there was only one other table she was dealing with and not many in the restaurant period. She finally comes over with a to-go box but no checks and at that point we had ate enough to make it pointless to take it with. She passed by a few more times with no checks. Finally someone else notices us and asks if we're ok. We ask for the checks, he says he's going to go get the manager. Never see a manager but our server finally comes by and drops the check. We immediately put our payments in the check-holders and prop them up on the corner of the table. She walks directly by them multiple times. The other guy finally came by and noticed we had the checks and I had to ask him to run them for us. He says he can't handle the cash and walks off to get our server. Drinks were overpriced imo. They charged $2.00 for that one slice of avocado. I was finished with my food around 7:10 yet we didn't end up leaving the restaurant until 7:40 due to waiting on checks and paying. Then we get to the movie and halfway through the friend has to leave because she starts feeling severely sick and when she comes back announces that she was in severe pain and there was no way that dish was gluten-free.

I asked to be put in a booth instead, and they obliged. Our server then came over, and while this may sound like a positive thing, every time you asked a question, she paused, got this HUGE grin, then said \"Yes!\" (no joke I could have said \"is your tea weak?\" grin...\"YES!\" \"Are the ribs good?\" grin...pause...wait for it...\"YES!\")We received our drinks pretty quickly. I then asked for a child's cup with a straw. \"YES!\" However, she walked by us at least twice to talk to her other tables, no child's cup. I asked again, \"YES!\". It arrived, then the salad (tasted fine), then our entrees. Like I said, my entree was great (Widow Maker burger). But then....I finished my drink and she saw it was empty, but right past she went. 5 minutes later, still waiting. My sister's drink was then empty. I asked another server to get our drinks as we could see ours standing back by the bar hanging out with no intention to head toward our table. He got our server and she did bring us the drinks. Not even an \"oh sorry for the wait.\". Instead she tried to get us to buy dessert, lol. Instead of asking if we'd like our ticket split (which I guess I shouldn't ASSUME someone will do, but I rarely have a time when I'm not asked) she brought our bill out on one check.

Not just a long human hair, short, kinky, rough, reddish colored hair. I'm praying it was from a beard- need I say more! Our server was pretty much nonexistent through the entire ordeal. However she did make a comment about the food looking \"dead\" in the window. For those of you not in this industry- this means the food had been sitting there a very long time! Why on earth would you serve it if this is what you thought?!! I'm sure it was dead- we had been sitting there 1.5hrs! Two hours into the meal when the hair was found we flagged down the manager again. She apologized immensely & said the GM would be out to talk to us shortly. He never showed up. Irritated, disgusted & completely annoyed we left enough money on the table to pay for the bottle of wine, the 1 individual glass my sister had to begin with & my salad. Probably a little extra too, but not much. Then we got up & left. Never in my life have I had to do this. I've been a bartender for over a decade & was a server in my parents restaurant prior to that. I will NEVER go back. This place seriously needs to get it together & a part of me feels like we should've walked out without paying all together, but couldn't because we are honest & weren't just trying to get a free meal.

We actually ended up going two days in a row because it was one of the closest sports bars to where we were staying showing the NBA Playoffs that had a patio.

So we went on Monday evening after a failed attempt at a shopping trip since all the shopping places close at 6 (lame). But thankfully made it in time for happy hour. I know this is a Nashville-wide thing, but the 2-for-1 beer deals still blew my mind. It's insane! How do they make any money? So while the atmosphere was exactly what we were looking for, the food was a bit...lacking. Actually, I take that back. The BF ordered chili, which was really actually good, despite the fact it had beans, but we're not in Texas so I'll give them a pass on that one. But we also ordered chicken strips tossed in wing sauce, and they were kind of a giant disappointment. I will say, it's not technically on the menu, so we have to put some of the blame on ourselves, but still. The breading was completely falling off and the sauce, while it had a decent kick was kind of...Asian-inspired? I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but it just wasn't great. We ended up leaving most of them untouched. So the next day we returned, mainly because our waitress informed us that Tuesday was all-day 2-for-1s (again...how do you make money?!), and there was another game on so we headed back because we figured we'd just eat before, and you can't go wrong with beer, a patio, and big TVs.This night was actually kind of funny, we ended up getting there super early (I was NOT missing shopping again people) and I think ran into a Match.com happy hour or something?

If you're looking for a thrifty, casual happy hour or the perfect spot to watch the game, Sam's is your place.My love affair with Sam's began when visiting my Vandy friends in college, and its solid, dependable, delicious food is what has kept me coming back. Sam's menu features exactly the kind of food you'd expect from a sports bar - wings, pizza, sandwiches and salads - but the thing that makes this place special is that it does these things extremely well. For example, when I told my friend Carson Popkin, 28, that I was writing this post she just said \"Wiiiiiings...\" and stared off hungrily into the distance before coming to and saying, \"They're phenomenal.\"But wings are not the only thing Sam's is doing right. The Cajun Pepperoni Pizza is a salty, crispy pie with just the right spicy kick, and the Campfire Chili with cheese and onions is simply one of the best bowls of chili I have ever had. And I've had some chili. When soup and chili cheese dogs make up 80% of your diet, you become an expert fast. In short, the food is straight-forward, fresh and very well-executed. Whether you need to grab a club and fries for lunch or cure your hangover with a Blue Moon and a burger, Sam's will do you right.And that is in no small part due to the atmosphere. Sam's is a quintessential sports bar with happy hour from 3-7 every weekday except Tuesday (when it's two-for-one!) and at least 20 TVs broadcasting games at all times. (It is a smoking establishment, so take that into consideration before you pull up a stool.) On any given Saturday there are 100+ sports fans screaming their guts out for their teams, and the wait staff generally does an good job keeping pace with the thirsty legions. It's even better when the weather is nice and they roll up the garage doors on the front side. Breeze + good people watching is the ultimate relaxation-maker.Sam's also has a lively game of trivia on Wednesdays and even livelier karaoke night on Fridays. In short, Sam's is my Cheers (and ironically, Sam was the guy who ran Cheers - coincidence? I think not). I'd suggest that you make it yours too... Except overcrowding would make my standard Saturday table even harder to come by, and we clearly can't have that. But what the hey, go visit them anyway. In no time at all, it'll be the place where everybody knows your name.1803 21st Avenue SouthNashville, TN 37212(615) 383-3601Sam's also has a second location in Hendersonville, so you suburbanites don't have to miss out on the fun.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 3 reviews", "date": "2011-03-09"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nDavid O.\n", "review": "The better half once got food poisoning here, so its forbidden that I suggest we return as a couple.

I'm afraid hearing someone crying over having to get their freakin' brand new car washed twice made me want to throttle some people. \u00a0The sports crowd has generally been a nice group when I've been there. \u00a0During the day time you can usually catch a more rugged crew... that's the only time I've had a bar patron tell me what to do with my life at Sam's without any word spoken by me.Restrooms - go from OK to \"I will hold it for the next 3 hours\" quickly. \u00a0Generally when the place is d-bag-overrun the mens room needs to be waded into. \u00a0I would not wear any non-fluid-tight shoes in there. \u00a0If you can fit into the bar though, chances are the bathrooms are at least ok.Larger groups, this place is probably not for you if you want to sit at one table. \u00a0A group I was with had 12 people and we managed to sort of hold down an area, but we usually had 2-3 people up.All in all, I like the place. \u00a0Their pizza is not the best, but it's still about as good the next couple of days. \u00a0It's definitely something to check out. \u00a0Parking can be a mess if anything's going on, and the lot is generally patrolled by someone looking for a handout when the crowd is bumping.One thing to note, if you're on a motorcycle, your gear is not safe. \u00a0Sam's and Boscos are evidently frequented by drunken kleptomaniacs. \u00a0I've had gloves stolen (was doing a Christmas eve ride, so I got to ride home with no gloves in 36 degrees) have seen and stopped someone trying to pick up someone's helmet and have heard tale of completely non-valuable things stolen by drunk people out of open cars. \u00a0So if you're a biker, do the uncool thing and take your gear in with you. \u00a0If you're a car owner lock everything / keep stuff out of site. \u00a0It's not the homeless who wander the area that are stealing, it's drunken college students.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 573 reviews", "date": "2010-10-21"}, {"rating": "1.0", "name": "\nAlexander S.\n", "review": "This is the worst bar experience I've ever had.

My friend ordered a Yazoo Pale Ale and received a cloudy, orange colored, spicy smelling blue moon. We sent them back and ordered Sweetwater 420 instead.

I love getting the traditional wing sauce along w/ ranch or bleu cheese for dipping. You can get them tossed in the wing sauce, but that tends to kill the crunch. Another star are the wings.

I'm usually a strict medium - weak hot when it comes to spicy foods, but they smelled so good I had to steal one from my boyfriends plate.

Don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against the place, but despite living within spitting distance of the place (yum?), I'd never frequented it simply because I don't really do fast food.I guess the obvious comparison to make is between this and Qdoba (where I admit that I have eaten MANY times in the past). I think that for the money, Chipotle is the better pick simply because the ingredients seem fresher, which is probably reflected in the relatively slimmer menu at Chipotle. Rather than overwhelming you with myriad options, you pretty much decide whether you want a burrito, a burrito bowl, tacos (soft or hard), salad, or tacos. The filling choices are the same for all of them (chicken, steak, barbacoa, carnitas, or veggies) and everything costs about $6.25. It seems like Chipotle has decided to focus on providing the best product possible, so while eating here every day would probably get boring, what you do get tastes pretty good. Also, the portions are HUGE. A single burrito will probably get you through the day because the amount they manage to cram into a flour tortilla (how do they do it?!?) is enough to feed a small family... or the average American, I suppose.The first time I came, I got the carnitas burrito, which was sufficiently good that my husband and I decided to come back. I think the barbacoa burrito is probably my favorite - the meat is juicy and nicely spiced. We both splurged and got guac on our burritos, and while $1.25 for this add in (the only one you have to pay for) may seem pricey, it was well worth it because this guacamole is muy delicioso. That said, if not for the coupon we had, two burritos and one drink would have cost us nearly $19... which seems kind of insanely expensive for fast food in my mind. Sure this is a healthier choice than a lot of other places, but for $20 there are a lot of other (non-fast food) places I'd hit up first before coming back here.

Their salsas are also quite bland.2) I'm sorry Nashville, consumption of queso sauce is acceptable only on nachos at sporting events and on occasions of extreme drunkenness. In my burrito, never.3) Their employees need to learn to roll. They just slop the ingredients onto the tortilla in a big mound without even a not to rough linearity (is that a word?). Then, they carelessly schlump (that's right, schlump) it all into an amorphous softball-like blob that quickly seeps through its wrapper and makes you devolve into taking a spoon to its bland, mushy innards.4) Nine bucks for a burrito and a drink!?

They start by layering the bottom of the bowl with cilantro infused rice and then offer you your choice of black or pinto beans. \u00a0You can then choose from steak, pork, or chicken. I have only gone with the steak once, the pork once, and the chicken the rest of the time because I thought it was the best of the three. Next, they ladle on the absolute best part of the bowl, which is the ancho bbq sauce. It is the perfect combination of my personal favorite flavor profile-smoky, sweet, and spicy. After that, you can get as wild and crazy as you want and load it up or keep it simple. I usually add pico de gallo, roasted corn salsa, habanero salsa, and shredded cheese. To complement this delicious bowl, I always add a few lime wedges to my Coke Zero that really works well with the flavors. With the great customer service and consistently tasty, fresh food, I will continue to make my bi-weekly visit and probably eat the Ancho BBQ Burrito Bowl every single time.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 31 reviews", "date": "2012-12-01"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nRobert K.\n", "review": "This Qdoba location is highly visible from West End and is situated in facing both West End and 21st. \u00a0It is kind of a weird angle for a building to be built, but hey, I guess it helps to catch your eye!I consider myself to be a Mexican food aficionado, hence why I have reviewed so many Mexican places. \u00a0I would consider Qdoba to be more of a fast food style Mexican place, than an actual restaurant. \u00a0I have only had the burritos here and they are pretty tasty! \u00a0The salsa they use is super zesty, I think it compliments the burrito well.", "location": "\nWest Palm Beach, FL\n", "exp": " 292 reviews", "date": "2008-08-29"}, {"rating": "2.0", "name": "\nSteven U.\n", "review": "this location is consistently the worst...

I know it's a tourist trap located by Opryland but I enjoy it. Who wouldn't enjoy a place that brings your FRIED food on a large plate the size of a semi tire?!Now, I don't eat here all the time. I've lived in Nashville for about 5 years now and ate here probably 3-4 times, usually with people visiting the city. I think it's a fun place to take people who want the \"country\" experience. The fried food doesn't hurt either. The restaurant is located near where the Briley Parkway and the Cumberland river intersect. The building is a large, wooden structure that looks like an old mill that would be found on a steam. Inside its all wood, literally. I think a couple acres of woodlands were lost when they built this place. All the times I've been there, it's never been overly busy. The wait has been no more than ten minutes. The servers are usually friendly, dressed in country attire and they take the cornbread in the iron skillet and toss it and flip it in the air. A little bit of show I guess, I've only had one server drop it on the floor and she got is another one. It was pretty funny. The fare is country cookin'. They've got fried catfish, fried chicken, fried shrimp, fried everything. They've also got a bunch of different steak options. You pretty much pick the main and then you'll get the fixings that come with it, fries, hushpuppies, fried onions, cole slaw and that skillet bread. The drinks are served in little copper cups, so you won't forget you're in a country cookin establishment. The mains from everyone at the table will come on a huge, metal plate, the fried mains and fries that is. You'll pick off what is yours from the plate to your plate. You get 4 pieces of what you order, at least with the chicken or fish. The food is good, it's a lot of food and a lot of fried. I couldn't eat everyday, but it's a nice treat. They've also got amazing fried pickles. If you go on their website, you're able to print off a coupon for a free order of them.

I'll explain why:First...When we walked in, we were not greater with a smile and welcomed. We were merely asked how many and seated in the far back corner of the restaurant as opposed to the best available. After we were seated, it took over 10 minutes for our server to even get to our table and take our drink order, which then took her another 10 minutes to bring to us, then another 10 minutes to return for our order. This pattern continued throughout our visit. She had no customer service etiquette at all, which seemed to be a trend throughout the employees. A manager never approached us to ask how our experience or food was. And when we checked out, the young lady at the front just chewed her gum, barely acknowledged us, ran my card and handed my receipt. No \"How was everything?\", no \"Hello\", no \"thank you\"....not ONE word. This was after we stood there approximately 5 minutes while she was doing something on a piece of paper before she put her hand out for our check. Secondly, when the plates and utensils were brought to our table, they were soaking wet. No one had taken the time to dry them of before bringing them out. Not one employee in the restaurant was smiling. Our food was cold when we FINALLY got it. The gift shop area looked just sad, like there was no attempt to make it look neat, stocked or sell-worthy and they outside (which has SO much potential) looked like it hadn't been maintained in years and appeared very dull. The whole atmosphere was very bland.Honestly, I only give two stars because I have so much hope for this place. My first time here I was thoroughly impressed. And if it was not for the amazing food and good prices, I would not have rated it as high as I did.

Sister-in-law found this place while searching on line. We went for dinner and were seated in a semiprivate room at a long table made up of four tables pushed together. Menu is limited and all meals served family style, which include coleslaw, fries, hush puppies, marinated onions & skillet bread. Our waiter seemed harried. He took our orders and once the food started arriving, we found more than one discrepancy. When he brought out the skillet bread, (uniquely served in cast iron mini skillets), he proceeded to show how to flip it in mid air, which instantly fell on the floor, instead of the pan where it belonged. Their signature item is 'fried catfish fillets' which was very good. ($11.95) Children's menu has catfish, and chicken ($6.50) or shrimp (6.95) This is a unique 'theme' type restaurant. Plates are gold pans and cups are tin. Lighting is very dim and with a dark menu, hard to see. Waiters are in period dress. Lots of rocking chairs in the foyer to sit in while you wait to get a table. The ambiance was nice, with added treat of looking out the window at the firefly's flitting by. I would suggest that they put more than one person with such a big group. Our server definitely needed some help. We had to ask more than once for refills on water & sweet tea. Overall a good tasty meal...just need to work on the service, which is why I can only give it three stars. *A bit of history on the name; 'Keelboatmen' brought goods & supplies down the Mississippi river in the early 1800's. Each boat had a 'champion' fighter , the 'Best of the Best'. To signify his rank, he wore a red turkey feather in his hat. It became an unwritten custom that one red feather must challenge another the moment they met, thus the arrival of a large fleet meant many a bloody battle.

Last week, we were in the area looking for rental houses (!!!!, not khan's related, but hell yes) and we swung by to try some sweets. We were with vegan friends who love this place and advised us that the wait for other food would be too long. We decided on the pumpkin cupcake with cream \"cheez\" and the \"cheezcake\" brownie. The brownie was pretty good. Super thick so I took one bite and that was enough for me because I don't have a huge sweet tooth. I didn't taste any cheezcake even though the one bite involved a piece of the cheezcake swirl. Still a good tasting brownie. I liked the cupcake as a whole just alright. The frosting wasn't that great to me. There was more spice in it than the cream cheese flavor. I was vegan for a short while so I know what to expect from vegan cream cheese. I just had higher expectations for the frosting from a vegan bakery. However, I did like the cupcake itself and I ate it all. Fast forward two days (yes, only two days). We were driving around aimlessly looking for rent signs again and we decided to stop for lunch. This round we didn't get any baked goods. I chose the special of the day: the bless your heart wrap. It was a whole wheat wrap filled with crispy \"chicken,\" mac & cheez, collard greens, and sweet potatoes with a side of potato salad. Per my suggestion, my husband chose the surly bird. I've heard it's awesome and he almost ordered the same thing i did. I wanted to try two different things and sharing food is one of the perks (and disadvantages) of being married! The bless your heart wrap was really good. I would have preferred a little more \"chicken\" and a little less collard greens.

Probably only about 10 minutes. 2) while the food was AWESOME, with tip I paid $25... For lunch. With no drinks.

I don't hide it and I'm not ashamed. But during a time in college and after I was vegetarian and vegan (until someone dangled bacon in front of my face at a diner). I can appreciated solid vegan food and I really enjoy the stuff on occasion. I have had a few cakes from Khan's before they opened their retail bakery at The Wild Cow but until a few weeks ago I have never gone inside their storefront on Porter Road.Khan's is very small. There are room for about 3 two-top tables, the bakery counter and that is it. \u00a0The decor screams \"hippy-vegan-cafe\" which is neither a good nor bad thing. It is just a fact. Steve and I went in for lunch and beside one gentleman finishing his sandwich and another waiting on a smoothie the place was empty. And even though the place was empty, it did feel that we waited a very long time for something as simple as a sandwich.I ordered the special which was the \"Kale Me Crazy.\" It contained fake crispy chicken, baby kale, carrots, artichoke hearts, cucumbers and a mint tahini dressing. I honestly wasn't a big fan of this dish. It was about 80% kale and since the chicken was the first ingredient listed I was expecting more chicken than I received. The mint tahini sauce was great, but I felt that something was just keeping this dish back from being a great wrap. \u00a0It did come with a side of potato salad that was SO GOOD. I would have never guessed that it was vegan. That potato salad seriously blew my mind.I will say that I was at Khan's a week before and ordered the Cactus Burrito (seitan chorizo, black beans, cactus, poblano peppers, avocado salsa, mixed greens and cashew cheese in a whole wheat wrap) and I really loved that thing. \u00a0My only issue with that burrito was that I wanted it to have way more cactus. I love cactus and so few places showcase what it can do.Steve ordered the Surly Bird which had the same crispy fake chicken as my wrap, but his sandwich had a whole cutlet of it. The Surly Bird also had fake cheddar cheese, arugula, tomato, red onions, chipotle agave mustard all grilled on naturally leavened whole wheat focaccia. His sandwich was the clear winner. I was surprised by how much I loved the grilled bread and the fake cheddar cheese. Plus in this sandwich you can taste just how good the crispy fake chicken is.Since Khan's is a bakery we couldn't leave without having something sweet. We went for the chocolate chip whoopie pie. This was the fanciest (and maybe healthiest) little Debbie snack cake. The cookies were very soft and had a great chip to batter ratio. \u00a0The cream in the center was very light and fluffy and not overly sweet like some sugar frosting tends to be.I should also mention that on Valentine's Day I went to Khan's to get a sweet strawberry chocolate cupcake for Steve. He liked it so much he didn't even let me have a bite!While Khan's sandwiches have been hit or miss for me (and trust me the hits are WORTH it) I can honestly say that this is the best vegan bakery I have ever been to. The sweets are just so darn good that you can buy them for your next get together, not tell anyone that they're vegan, and no one will be able to guess.

As a vegan who loves breakfast and brunch, sometimes it can be tough to find hearty dining options that will quench my love for breakfast sammies and biscuits.

You may scratch your head and state that this is an expensive cost for a biscuit sandwich but I can assure you that it was worth every penny and deceivingly filling. If your appetite isn't ready for all that, you can opt for an \"Egg\" Biscuit, \"Sausage\" Biscuit:, or Disco Biscuit Deluxe. So. Yum.

I came here for the first time with a friend during the Southern Festival of Books this past weekend. It was a Saturday afternoon, and we learned upon arrival that they were closing in another 10 minutes. We just wanted a piece of cake, which was already prepared and sitting in a glass case. As we were looking at the case deciding on which we wanted, we were stiffly informed \"We're Closed!\" by a gentleman who worked there and that we would not be able to order. Then he turned to the woman working the register (who was in the process of taking a man's order) and told her to continue helping that man, because \"he's a regular.\" He proceeded to point us toward the door and made it abundantly clear we weren't welcome even though it was 10'til. Unbelievable. With all the tourists that were in town this weekend for the home game & the book festival, I am baffled that someone would chance dirtying a visitor's experience in our city with that kind of nonsense.Despite how rude we felt this encounter was, I went back the next day to get my cake & a coffee-drink. Because, you know, cake is cake and I have needs. And I've got to tell you, the customer service was lackluster and the cake was at best mediocre. The coffee was so thick and sweet I threw more than half of it away. My boyfriend got a panini, and that was really good, but still--definitely not worth patronizing this business after how I've seen they treat their customers. I work in corporate retail, so maybe I'm overly sensitive to these things, but I very firmly believe that there is absolutely NO excuse whatsoever for poor customer service. And that is definitely what's happening here.Anyway, the second star is for the panini.

I work at the library next to Provence, so this place is kinda the only game in town if I want some coffee at work or don't have time to pack breakfast or lunch. I used to go at least 3x a week to this place. There are some good things about Provence, but unfortunately, most of them are bad. This only applies to the downtown location. I've only been to the Hillsboro village location once.The good: their chocolates, tortes, and sweet things are damn good. Their croissants are stellar, when they don't overcook them. Their bread in general is good. It ought to be. They've won awards for it, apparently. The coffee is pretty good, too, even if Starbucks' is better. Tomato basil soup, shepherd's pie, and pot pie are all tasty and have none of the faults the other hot items have. The sweets case is refrigerated and has a door on it. Nice and clean.The bad: The pastries case does not have a door. I have seen flies all over the contents. The food from the hot case (quiches, paninis, etc) is greasy and lacking in filling. It just doesn't look or taste fresh.The ugly: Beware the open refrigerated case across from the checkout. Every item I have ever purchased has been spoiled. Olive tapenade (With way too much anchovy. And it didn't come with bread.)- spoiled. Orzo salad- spoiled. Couscous salad- spoiled. Tuna salad- spoiled. Greens- wilted, wet and brown at the edges. They make entirely too much food for that cooler. It sits there too long and turns, and then people buy rotten food. That Tuesday sticker on the bottom? It's probably last Tuesday. Also, the coffee grinder is next to the ice machine, and they often leave the lid off the machine. I'm fairly sure that's a health code violation. it also means your ice water will often have coffee grounds in it.The service is abominable. They have no system for handling customers efficiently, so the wait is always at least 10 minutes, even for a simple cappucino. I waited 17 minutes for Ben to heat my panini for 40 seconds. And when I went to my desk and opened my package, it was only half a panini instead of the whole one I ordered. I also discovered I'd been overcharged about $1.50. I went back to dispute it, but now I don't know how many times I've been overcharged in the past.The staff is friendly about half the time, and generally preoccupied the rest of the time. The manager, Ben, is always surly. I don't think I've ever seen him with a definite expression on his face. But I'm not mad about that. I didn't go there for the conversation- I went for food. Didn't get either. I'd love for this place to take a turn for the better, but until then, Starbucks is a block down Church St, and there's a foofoo little sweets bakery half a block up 6th Ave if you can catch them while they're open.

This location is the closet cafe to my job. It opens at 7am, I have a 10min grace period before having to officially clock-in, and so it should be a breeze to go into the Provence then hop along into my work. It is not!As stated before, Provence is supposed to open at 7am. The manager usually doesn't get the place opened until 15-20min after that. He moves around like he's made of molasses and smells like he's just inhaled a chimney worth of smoke, sometimes. When one does go in to order the customer is either met with warmth and friendliness, or the customer doesn't exist at all. It's not uncommon for one to see three bodies roaming around behind the counter without so much as a glance at the people waiting in line. I once asked a person going before me had she been waited on, and she said, \"No.\" This was shocking because she and I were the first two in line!Apparently, they were just getting ready for the lunch crowd and hadn't pulled everything out yet. This wouldn't have been a problem if it wasn't for the fact that this location does this constantly! I've actually had semi-cooked food delivered to me because one of the guys hadn't put the food in at an appropriate time, therefore it wasn't ready by the time the lunch rush. That, of course, didn't stop them from serving it and charging $10. So, I received bland half-cooked food that I could've made better at home for less cost. One also has to pay extra for drinks, like with most places. However, one can't get free or reduced price refills, unless it's coffee.The only reason this place is getting two stars is because some of the staff are great, and the pastries are decent.

Each time, we've been one of just a few patrons in the restaurant, but that says more about the nights we've gone (Sunday and Tuesday) than about the restaurant. The steaks are very good. It's prime beef, expertly seasoned and perfectly cooked. My favorite is their Peppercorn-encrusted NY Strip. My wife prefers the porcini encrusted filet. I can't say I blame her; I always sneak a few bites. We usually each have a Caesar salad, the romaine is always crisp hearts, not too heavily dressed. We usually do asparagus or broccoli for our vegetable and are never disappointed; they are either steamed or blanched then reheated in a hot water bath and drizzled with a small amount of clarified butter. They are always perfectly cooked with a excellent texture; the happy medium between crunchy and mushy. The service is usually attentive without being overly so; you can go have a romantic dinner with your significant other and not be interrupted every 5 minutes by an overzealous server. That said, they'll be there when you need them; high end servers are experts at reading body language and if you look like you need someone, someone will be with you shortly.

The \"modern\" take was interesting and ended up being rather tasty. My favorite side was the asparagus and the mash potatoes, which is weird because I typically don't like mash potatoes. The asparagus was cooked properly and with too much butter, translation: excellent. The mash potatoes were creamy and had an excellent flavor. We ordered our steak medium rare and it was just that.

The drinks were potent AND delicious (love the Clear Cosmo, and for those counting calories, they also have a 99 calorie martini called Tickled Pink), and the food was also divine. The calamari was both generous and some of the best we have ever had and the burger was really substantial and clearly made of quality beef. I admit that I overindulged, knocking back 3 cocktails, but when my bill only came to $18, I felt my decadent ways were a good investment! I also have to say that the two staff members who waited on us were really solicitous and clearly concerned with giving us the best possible experience, which helped add to our happy buzz.The atmosphere at Fleming's is quietly classy, with a \"good old boys club\" kind of vibe in terms of decor, but hey, this place is a steakhouse, so I guess that makes sense. It may not have that trendy urban feel that I generally gravitate towards, but it certainly doesn't feel staid or outdated either.

This location was particularly disappointing to our group of 11, who have visited the likes of McCormick & Schmicks, Ruth's Chris, and Smith & Wollensky in the last few months. Even compared to my last Flemings visit in Phoenix, this place was more like a Chili's than a high-end steakhouse. What was the problem? A mediocre wait staff, a slow kitchen, a disorganized FOTH, and hostesses with attitude. On a half-full Thursday night house, timing was off, courtesy and respect were forgotten, and basic hygiene was ignored. Could I be oversensitive? Maybe. But for $50 a steak, I expect the following: - prompt, courteous greeting upon entry and after the announcement of our reservation - a hostess that, when seating our group, ensures everyone's comfort and courteously speaks to all members of the group - a server/waiter that presents himself professionally, speaks clearly and enunciates, and uses speech that is appropriate for the classy environment in which he serves - a kitchen that understands how to properly time a large group order and prioritize according to the same standard as a small order  - the delivery of our on-menu food order IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR'S WAIT - a bussing or support staff that keeps their fingers off the plates when serving - a server/waiter that ensures each member of a group RECEIVES THE CORRECT ENTREE AND SIDE DISH before disappearing - \u00a0a server/waiter that performs a PROPER CHECKBACK!That really sums up the issues. I provided two stars in my review for properly trimming and cooking my steak, and for keeping our wine and water glasses full.

Not over-seasoning the steaks are key in letting the natural flavor of the beef shine through, and that certainly was the case here. I can not gush enough about the fantastic service I received. Every server and hostess managed to wish me a Happy Birthday, followed by a delicious complimentary chocolate cake and very thoughtful origami flowers from one of the servers.

Their 5-6-7 rocks. They, unlike their upscale counterparts include cocktails in their happy hour. The cocktails are strong and good. I went to Flemings twice last week. I sat in the bar area both times. Beth and Matt are awesome, knowledgeable bartenders. When I went on Wednesday, I let the bartenders know that I planned to return on Friday with a larger group and I asked if they could assist with the seating. The bartenders said that they would help accommodate us and unlike other restaurants, they remembered and came through for me. That is a huge plus in my book.Now on to the food and cocktails-Wednesday, I orders the Pomtini, which rocks. My sister ordered the Tickled Pink which was advertised as being only 99 calories. I tasted it, and I didn't like the fake sugary taste to it. But I am not a diet or splenda type of girl. I like all of the million calories inside of my cocktails. :-) I ordered the seared ahi tuna and my sister order the Prime burger. The \u00a0portions were nice for the price that we paid. Well worth it! The tuna was perfectly cooked and it was served with a spicy mustard sauce. I love spice in my life, so I loved the sauce. The Prime burger was HUGE! It was served with 2 huge onion rings. The burger is the best thing on the apps menu for the price. It will totally help you if you plan to drink several of those $6 cocktails. The next time I go to Flemings I will definitely try the Prime burger. All in all, even when the restaurant got packed with the after work crowd, the service was still excellent. Friday, I ordered another Pomtini to start off with. I ended up switching to the Tropical cocktail. Beth made it will blueberries instead of the cherry which made the flavor even better. I started off with the bar b que shrimp. The shrimp was a nice size, but it was completely different from the New Orleans style bbq shrimp. Although it was different, I loved it. I tried the calamari next. I wasn't as pleased with this dish so I shared to the girls at my table. I didn't like how the calamari was pre-tossed in the sauce instead of having it on the side to dip into. After a while, the calamari had a soggy feel to it. If I was to order it again, I would ask the chef to put the sauce on the side. Again the service from Matt and Beth was wonder. They were patient with the larger group that I brought and very attentive. As soon as our cocktails got low, one of them were there to ask if we wanted a refill.

The bartender was so excited to make the drink that I couldn't turn it down and I'm so glad I didn't. We started with the charcuterie plate which was a generous portion of bread and meats/cheeses. My only gripe is that they would not bring out a basket of bread for us to start, but our server was more than accommodating when we needed more bread for the bread plate we had ordered. The butter was fantastic-- it is perhaps worth getting the bread just for this. We ordered the bleu potatoes appetizer and were not disappointed. It curbed our hunger a bit before the entrees came out. Although I did think this could have been a bit larger for the price.For the entrees, the bone-in Rib Eye was apparently the winner (although I did not try it). It came with broccoli and shoestring sweet potatoes and looked amazing. Because it took a few more minutes to come out, the water brought over a few wine samplings for the girl at our table who ordered it while she waited. Yet another nice touch by the restaurant.The rest of us ordered shrimp and grits or a salad with steak/chicken on it. The grits were cooked to perfection and the only complaint was that the shrimp were not larger.

I had to succumb and went to this place because the one that I go to down the road is closed on Mondays. The soup tasted like the base and seasoning was used from the ramyun noodle packets. I had the fish cakes as a banchan and the flavor to that was so indescribable that I had to spit it out. The menu was limited and over-priced. I had the cold version of the octopus bibimbap. My sister wanted her bibimbap in a dolsot pot, but we both don't eat beef. She had asked if she can get chicken instead and the older lady told us, \"No chicken only beef!\" We were prepared to pay extra for chicken but didn't want to make a scene so she went with the beef. I had gotten my bibimbap and what do I see mixed in with my octopus? Beef! My sister doesn't eat seafood and since they had told us that it was \"beef\" bibimbap. She had octopus mixed in with hers! My guess is that since they were making 2 versions of the bibimbap they thought it would be OK to add one to the other. The bibimbap wasn't good for both of us. We ended up just sipping on tofu jjigae. My sister had ordered a large version of her tofu jjigae to-go, but instead it was served at the table when we confirmed to the waitress 4 times it was to-go!

The service is always good and the lunch specials are reasonably priced. The banchan are tasty and quite useful for pulling people a bit out of their comfort zone if they've never tried such things. It's actually a pretty good place to bring people who have never tried much in the way of Korean food, as nothing there is overly intimidating.Where this place really seems to shine is with its soups. They have soft tofu soups of every description, served to you fresh and boiling hot. The bibimbap is also quite good, and much like the soup, is served searing hot in a bowl designed to keep it that way for a while. If you aren't the sort of person who loves their food at a high temperature (or aren't familiar with how these sorts of foods are commonly served), this might not be the best place for a quick meal as you'll have to wait quite a while for it to cool off.

I didn't order it because I'm pregnant, but if they do actually carry it, it's worth an entire star.In general, I suspect the high marks for this place come from people that don't eat korean food regularly at different locations. The food is certainly good, but it's not superior to what several other korean restaurants, like seoul garden, are serving. The main thing working against So Gong Dong is their far out location.

Let's be serious now, the word \"TOFU\" is in the name of the restaurant. \u00a0All of their tofu soups have a fantastic and authentic flavor--some of the other tofu soups around town don't have the best broth, so their soups are lackluster. \u00a0But, this place gets it right. \u00a0And they come out in a hot stone pot. In case you are not an expert on Korean cuisine, when they say that the stone pot is \"hot\", it really is hot. Do not touch it with your hands. (P.S. if you are wondering why they gave you a raw egg, it's because you're supposed to crack it into the boiling soup and let it cook.) Their bulgogi (marinated beef) is also excellent, but a bit on the price-y side.As much as I love the tofu soups, I tend to order the Dolsot Bibimbap more often. \u00a0Seriously, every time I go to this restaurant, I tell myself that I'll order the seafood tofu soup but then right when the waitress comes to the table, I will second-guess myself and end up ordering the Dolsot Bibimbap. Why? \u00a0Because it is the best of both worlds and possibly the most delicious meal ever. \u00a0Dolsot Bibimbap is a traditional Korean dish that basically amounts to a bowl of rice with different toppings and a sweet chili sauce (that you add in to your tasting). \u00a0But, the best part is \"Dolsot\" which means a hot stone pot, so just like the sizzling pot the tofu soup is served in, this rice dish is served in a piping hot stone bowl so you cook/fry the rice to your liking. \u00a0It is absolutely remarkable and I love that you can add in as much of the chili paste as you want--so if you want it spicier, you can add more. \u00a0Most Korean restaurants just end there--but So Gong Dong Tofu House anticipated the torment of deciding between ordering a tofu soup and the Dolsot Bibimbap because every Dolsot Bibimbap is accompanied by a small tofu & mushroom soup! \u00a0IT'S THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS! :)As all Korean restaurants do, your meal is also served with complimentary barley tea (iced or hot) and a variety of daily cold side dishes (which you can always ask for more of, although whenever I go with my Korean friends, they sometimes get embarrassed by how many times I want to ask for more of the side dishes!). \u00a0The quality of the side dishes are great. \u00a0Sometimes they'll give you omelets or even japchae (sweet potato noodles with veggies)!The service isn't spectacular here. Sometimes, you have to wave over the only waitress attending to the tables--but the food is worth the wait and the lack of service. \u00a0Yes, it can be slightly pricier when compared to Korea House, but the quality makes up for it. \u00a0It's authentic, delicious, hot, and gosh...now that I'm writing this review, I have a burning desire to get in my car and drive over there!", "location": "\nSan Francisco, CA\n", "exp": " 310 reviews", "date": "2011-02-13"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nQ Y.\n", "review": "We have tried almost every item on their menu over the last 6 or 7 years.

Sadly, no such method of summoning service exists at So Gong Dong.I could have gotten past the awful service if the food had been incredible, but sadly that just wasn't the case. I ordered one of their combination platters which consisted of a soup plus half order of bulgogi for about $20. Although this would be a ton of food at any other restaurant, I have to say that I was able to eat the soup and the bulgogi all in one sitting and still be a little bit hungry. Clearly, this restaurant is attempting to serve \"upscale\" Korean food, but ultimately this place fails to do even that; the soup and bulgogi were both good but are no better than what I've had at Korea House or Midori.Ultimately, So Gong Dong provides average Korean fare at excessive prices with miserable service.

However, I have been using the same veterinarian for damn near ten years and refuse to go elsewhere - which led me to search for a nearby bar and patio while waiting for my pup. I noticed a billboard advertising this place, and whipped out my Yelp app to map me there.As I drew closer to my destination via back roads, I realized this little place is right in the heart of the Opry madness.

There were zero cars in the lot, but it WAS mid-afternoon on a weekday.The interior surprised me though...in more ways than one! Ha! It was decorated far better than one would imagine, and I even caught a glimpse of Navy memorabilia displayed on the wall. (Brownie points for that from this lady.) I didn't spend much time inside though. I wanted the patio.The interstate noise is pretty loud, but the patio is large and equipped with fans to aid in beating the summer heat. The server was super nice, but wasn't the best at being attentive throughout the entire visit.The beer selection was minimal for my preferences, so I opted for their $1.00 draft PBR. Hey...it may not be the best beer, but pretty damn good for only $1.00 each. I was surprised to discover the offer Honey Jack, but was saddened when it became apparent it had been sitting on the rocks too long, likely waiting to be delivered.The food definitely didn't win any points with me. The hushpuppies were overcooked, and the nachos...ugh...I just don't have words.

As we were running, we noticed the Cracker Barrel yellowed sign and took it as a symbol of salvation. Me thinking of apple crisp, Emily of fried chic chic chickeeen!! But, as we were running from our \"situation\" behind, I saw a sign for John's and we headed 'cross the street. As we panted up the ramp I noticed, hm. There are pictures of all Senor Citizens.

We stepped in - perhaps out of the burst of unwelcome exercise and I wanted to burst back out. All the people in the pictures were, in fact, inside. And there were more.

We ordered the puppies, as one simply must do when in Rome, battered prawns, sweet potato fries and of course the chicken salad, since we are ALL about the health... We received. We ate. We didn't stop. We ordered more. Our waitress divulged a dessert secret, they had an Elvis Special - to which I said; don't even tell me what it is, we'll take 2! Each served a little ramekin of pudding-like substance that was gooey, sticky, messy & sweet. A concoction of oreos, peanut butter and banana pudding, we were told - some of The King's favorite things. Julie Andrews, your raindrops on flippin' roses were just upstaged. Not only was the food real, authentic Southern style good - there was live music too, which they have every night. Our waitress kept asking us to stay so that we could hear her sing.

It knows what it is, and it is fine with it. It is also kind of stuck in 1970s, early 1980s country music scene. I have been in there a few times, and they are playing the same tape of a bunch of country music stars sitting around singing songs and talking. It's even got a skinny Vince Gill in it. It just kind of reminds me of an era of Nashville that doesn't really exist much anymore, for better or worse. And part of the reason is it doesn't try to hard to capture that. It just is.

I read the reviews and the overall star rating was questionable, but I went ahead, hoping they had improved as some reviews mentioned they had only been open a few months. I wanted to love this place, but instead I was happy to leave and never return.You walk into the restaurant and there is desk where presumably a hostess might be, but isn't. We stood there for about 7 minutes with another group ahead of us. Finally a waitress came by to seat us. Ok, not a great first impression. I don't know why they don't have a dedicated hostess during lunch rush, but alright I could get over that. We ordered the poutine with the gravy on the side because we know chorizo in Arizona, but don't how they prepare it in Nashville, in gravy. It took quite awhile for it to come out, but I get it, they were busy. The gravy was surprisingly good. Sadly, that is where the journey of delight ended. The fries were SOOO salty. I love salt. I have several types and generally over-salt my food. So when I say they were too salty, they were way too salty. We had very little breakfast and were hungry so we kept trying to eat them. The egg was beyond poorly prepared...the whites weren't cooked but the underside of the egg was nearly burnt, with those unappetizing plastic curled edges. The cheese curds never got to the melted gooey stage because the fries were not hot and we had the gravy on the side. Poor execution is an understatement. Another reviewer had mentioned that the fries were overly salted and I am ashamed to say, I assumed they had corrected the dish. Save your money, time and tastebuds and don't order their fries.The sweet potato tots and marshmallow cream were tasty. Easily the best thing we ate. The tots had those almost over-done edges that offset the sweet and provided a great bite with the marshmallow cream. As other reviewers mention, this side is more sweet than savory.So, this is a burger place. Specifically a burger \"boutique\". Hubby and I decided to split a burger so we could have room to try the appetizer and a couple sides. We ordered a classic bacon cheeseburger. To say it was disappointing would be mild. Who looks at this stuff before it comes out? Two strips of bacon sat limply across the burger...I'm talking almost opaque fat here. This was no strip of bacon, this was a bacon noodle that couldn't stick to a wall if it tried. Booooo. If I want to eat congealed fat on my burger, I will order it. I want crispy fat! I asked if I could get bacon that was cooked, the waitress apologized and got it replaced. The new strips were much better, but in the range of applewood smoked bacon it's still mediocre bacon. There wasn't the deep luscious smoked bacon flavor you get from quality bacon purveyors. Onto the burger: It's virtually flavorless. No delicious juices pouring out of this burger as you bit into it. No fantastic grilled beef flavor dancing on your taste buds. The burger itself is super mediocre. We didn't get a shake. It was our original plan, hence the split burger, but we just didn't want to pay for anymore disappointment. We had such a great experience with Jeni's ice cream we decided to revisit them later instead.There are other burger places on yelp with much better reviews. I would pass on this place.

Big bar in the middle of the room and tables all around.If you were wondering about the menu, well, they have all types of burgers. Yes, as the name says, it is all about burgers so if you don't like that you probably shouldn't go. They do have a turkey burger option, some standard burgers, lamb burger, \"chorizo\" burger, etc and so forth. And they have sides such as fries cooked in beef fat (um...YESSSS), onion rings, etc. Oh and they also have booze, which is my favorite.Drinks were good cocktail creations and there were choices for whatever liquor you prefer. They also have beer and such. And probably Coke and water too but...boring.Given my first trip to FLIP in Birmingham I steered away from the chorizo burger. Not that it isn't good, but that it isn't CHORIZO. To me, that implies a burger either mixed with or totally made out of CHORIZO which is SAUSAGE. This is PORK with CHORIZO SPICES. There's a big difference. Just FYI. So this time I went with the lamb burger because I can totally get into any Mediterranean flavors. The burger was big and well spiced and flavorful.

The parking lot was packed so we figured the restaurant would be packed as well. It was less than a quarter full, so I guess people who come to Flip are averse to car pooling. Hostess greeted us and seated us promptly. We ordered a few appetizers and asked for a little more time to look over the menu. I ended up ordering the lunch special (burger + side + drink for Burger price + 3.75), ordering a Stack, Ceaser Salad and Sweet Tea. The appetizers we ordered arrived promptly: beef tartare, onion rings and fried pickles. The onion rings were a disappointment - slightly undercooked, lacking flavor and mealy. The fried pickles were excellent, although the ones near the bottom were absolutely swimming in grease. The beef tartare was just OK - it tasted mostly of capers and looked really pre-made. Like, put in a ring mold last night and plopped out for our pleasure the next day. A lot of the beef was gray, contrasting sharply with the bits of beef that looked nice and pink. It's just color but visuals matter when you're eating raw meat. There was also something stringy on top, like a sauce that had dried out to the consistency of plastic that was unpleasant. Would not recommend the tartare in the future. Our burgers arrived fairly fast. The Stack was delicious, with the only downside being it was almost too buttery. It tasted a bit like a breakfast sandwich in that respect, but the pickles and b+b sauce were worth the price of entry alone. Burger was actually a bit small - an average male could probably inhale two of these. The Ceaser Salad was ATROCIOUS. I suspected the tartare had been set the night before, but I absolutely believe this Ceasar had been sitting around for at least a couple of hours, if not more. Once you dress a salad, you should eat it right away. The longer it sits, the slimier and nastier it gets. It's inedible after a night in the fridge. This is the salad that was served to me. Nasty, slimy and old. Croutons were the size of crumbs and too few. The whole salad was COVERED in shredded parm, like they were trying to hide the lettuce underneath. I ate a few bites and pushed it to the side. It was a stark contrast to the rest of the meal. I tried some fries too. They were good but cold. Smokey mayo was good. Waitress was OK but she added an extra burger to our tab. So watch your checks. Prices overall weren't terrible but this place is more expensive than say Five Guys. And I really didn't see anything that blew me away besides in the in-house pickles. It was all pretty standard fare. All in all, I would eat here again, but I don't want to fight with people over parking and the lunch rush was overwhelming the restaurant as we were leaving.There were probably 5 or 6 parties waiting for a table. \u00a0I also think it's silly that I need to valet my car in this part of town.

With options like The Pharmacy and Burger Republic, outstanding food needs to call me all the way out to Charlotte.As a \"Top Chef\" and Blais fan, I wanted it to be outstanding. I really tried. But with the loud music, absent waiting area and fair food, I won't be returning.Specifically, here's what didn't work for me:1. Since it's a rainy day, the outdoor seating area was closed. My guess is this space is used for overflow for folks waiting for tables. Without that area, the tiny space in front of the host's stand (which inexplicably faces the bar instead of waiting guests) was crowded.2. Other reviewers have noted the loud music, and I'll second/third/fourth their complaint. It's nearly as bad as Adele's sound quality, with the music video-playing TV's volume on blast in the dining area.2. There were nine beers on draught, and they only had three of them. They didn't say if they were out or if those supplies haven't yet arrived -- the restaurant's only been open a week -- and those beers they did have weren't all that appealing or local.3. I ordered the fauxlafel (chickpea, arugula, cucumber, pickled beets, red onion, tzatziki yogurt spread) on a lettuce wrap instead of a bun, which is an option I was glad to see. I expected to be able to pick it up and eat it with my hands; you know, like a lettuce wrap. Instead, the burger was placed atop a wedge of lettuce, so I had to eat it with a knife and a fork. This isn't a minus -- yet the burger was so dry that it crumbled eat time I tried to stab it with the fork. The flavors were nice, and I liked the crisp lettuce against the yogurt spread.4. My husband's bison burger tasted like an elementary school's sloppy joe. It was messy, fell apart and not special. I'm surprised this came from Blais's genius mind; maybe I don't understand it yet? Maybe there are hidden chemical compounds that will burst with flavor in our mouths overnight? Doubtful.Here's what I thought was grand:1. The beef fat french fries come with smoked mayo and ketchup as dipping sauces, and the smoked mayo is excellent. Why have we been dipping into ketchup for so long while this existed in the world? I'm someone who orders truffle fries and regrets it -- They're greasy and not worth the extra couple dollars. Here, the beef fat was light, and the flavor's worth it.2. The milkshakes are delicious. They leave no coating on the roof of your mouth, and are hit-the-spot cold. I had the foie gras milkshake -- yep, that's right; only Blais -- and the server (who had a great personality/disposition) said I'm the first to order it from her. They melt the foie gras down before blending it, and there are small, delicious pebbles of it mixed through the shake. Small bits of doughnut rested in my husband's Krispy Kreme milkshake.There was more \"eh\" than \"yum!\" in our visit this afternoon (around 2:30 on a rainy Sunday with a 25-minute wait), so we're unlikely to return.", "location": "\nHermitage, TN\n", "exp": " 23 reviews", "date": "2015-01-25"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nAnne B.\n", "review": "This is the best burger restaurant I have ever been to.

YAY! Needless to say, I was not disappointed. FLIP lived up to its expectations! To start off, I ordered the krispy kreme milkshake, which was muy delicioso. HOT DAMN were the milkshakes good! The milkshake had a very thick and creamy texture along with tiny bits of krispy kreme glazed doughnuts. After satisfying my sugar cravings, it was time for the more savory dishes. Even after studying the menu both in store and online countless of times, I will still lost as to what I should order. I know it's lame, but I decided to stick with the classic and added bacon to spice things up. The burger was juicy and had all the components you would want in a burger!!! I was kinda disappointed that this FLIP burger location didn't offer the fry side sampler... As a result, I was forced to give up the onion rings and got the fries and sweet potato tots. sacrifices had to be made... :( The fries were flavorful and not too oily. The tots were AMAZING. (that is saying a lot since i'm not a huge fan of sweet potato) They were seasoned with some sort of spice mix that gave them a little kick.

I was a meat eater at the time and the burgers were great, but the shakes were even better. Since then, time has passed, I'm a vegetarian, and now there's a Flip Burger in Nashville. After checking their online menu to be sure there was at least one vegetarian burger option, my husband and I decided to check it out for lunch. It was okay. Pros:*Great flavored shakes*Delicious fauxlafel burger *Friendly serviceCons:*Really bizarre physical layout *Few places to wait (inside)*Fried foods are all swimming in a pool of oil*Straws were too narrow in the shakes, or they weren't blended enough*Expensive for what it is*Slow serviceGood for kids? I don't feel like this is a place where I would take my almost 5yo. Not because of the food or the atmosphere, but mostly for the slow service. Maybe in a few months when the hype has worn off, the wait times for a table have decreased, and the hiccups in service have been worked out. At the same time, it's not really a date night kind of place to me. Good for vegetarians? Well, they definitely had some vegetarian-friendly options. The fauxlafel burger was probably the best version of a falafel burger that I've ever had - lots of places offer this, but almost no one in Nashville does it well. It wasn't the best vegetarian burger I've had in Nashville though - that would be a tie between Fido and J Alexander's. The beet and goat cheese salad was really large and very tasty. It's a bummer not to be able to enjoy the fries here, since they're fried in beef tallow (but at least they're up front about it). They also have a veggies and hummus platter, if that's your thing. Overall impressions:We arrived a little bit before noon on a Wednesday and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. No big deal and not a surprise for a recently opened restaurant. However, this left us with some time to ponder the really bizarre layout. If it's cold out, the only place for customers to wait is the fairly small open area right by the check in desk. I suppose people could wait at the bar if they wanted, but all of the bar seats were taken while we were there by people eating lunch. This won't be a problem in warm weather (lots of space to wait outside), but it really made me wonder if Flip failed to do their homework re: the local climate, and didn't understand that it does get colder in Nashville.  \u00a0 \u00a0 That brings me to weird layout thing #2. They didn't have double doors, so basically, every time someone came into or left the restaurant, there were major drafts throughout the entire front half of the restaurant. And this was on a fairly warm day! And that leads naturally into weird layout thing #3: between the awkward non-waiting waiting area and the drafts, the weirdly positioned tables on either side of the front door seemed really unpleasant to sit at - which is of course where we ended up getting seated.  \u00a0 \u00a0 The food itself was decent. The beet salad was tasty, although verging on over-dressed. It would be nice if they offered a fauxlafel burger patty as an add on for salads, instead of just meat. The fauxlafel burger was fab, as I said above. Both the onion rings and the fried cheese curds were served in a kind of odd way. I'm used to fried foods having some kind of paper to absorb grease at the bottom of the serving dish. In this case, there was no paper, so there was basically a lake of oil at the bottom of each. The top layer of fried food was great, but everything towards the bottom was just greasy and nasty. The onion rings were also served at a fairly tepid temperature. The shakes were as tasty as I remembered them being from the last time we visited the original Atlanta location, but either they were under-blended or they're using some straws that are just too small for the chunks of stuff in the shake.  Our bill for one vegetarian burger, one salad, an order of fried cheese curds, a side of onion rings, and two shakes was $38, pre-tip. Big safety concern: Their valet parking lot is across Charlotte from the restaurant. This means their valets have to dash on foot across the incredibly busy traffic on Charlotte and then navigate your car to the restaurant parking lot. This is, in one word, TERRIBLE. Not only is it a safety issue for their valets, it's a huge safety issue for anyone driving on Charlotte. So, if you're driving past Flip, please be aware that this is going on. I have no idea who approved this idea, but they were nuts.

We put our names in at 6:30 and were given an hour wait quote...we were finally seated at 8, finally were asked to order drinks at 8:20, and didn't get our food until 9:10. At one point our server actually mentioned how bored he was. \u00a02nd rant- The layout of this place is ridiculous. Walking in the front door, you're immediately greeted by the hostess' back as the hostess station faces the opposite direction from the door. The restaurant is a giant \"U\" shape and the kitchen is at the back. We had the misfortune of being seated right next to the kitchen, in what turned out to be the back corner of the whole place. \u00a0The restrooms were on the other side of the servers station in our line of sight, but whenever we got up to use the restroom, we were redirected all the way around the dining room. I understand that it may be a liability to have customers walking through the service station but based on how service was going, our little personal bathroom escort should've been busy assisting his co workers and getting some tables turned. 3rd rant -The food was average at best. Out of the 6 people at our table, not one person's burger was cooked as specified...medium rare was well done, medium was well done, well done was rare. I got the Trio with the classic, butcher block, and turkey with beef fat fries. All 3 were over cooked and dryer than dry. The toppings were basic and underwhelming.

I love a great burger as much as the next person, and everything about this place was great! We started off with the Fried Pickles & Fried Cheese Curds. \u00a0I prefer Dill pickles, and these were B+B, but the breading was incredible and just the right amount without overkilling the frying. \u00a0If you're a B+B pickle fan, this should be an automatic go-to. \u00a0 The Fried Cheese Curds could not have been more perfect, and I am not exaggerating when I say they are the best I've had. Ever. The cheese curds are served with a sauce that tasted a little like tartar sauce to me, and I think that could be swapped out with a spicy ranch of some sort to give it a nice power kick, but once again personal preference...Moving on to the burger, I got the Butcher's Cut, medium, and it was cooked to perfection. Pink + juicy center, while not moo-ing. \u00a0Just the right amount of blue cheese as well, so it was not overpowering. And whatever is in that red wine jam, I want it on everything. I got a side of fries and OH MY GOSH! These were the perfect combo of crunchy on the outside, yet mushy on the inside. I almost went with the sweet tater tots (and definitely will try at some point!), but so happy I went with the fries. A \"side\" is enough for (2) people in my opinion as well.

FLIP's focus isn't on making the \"best burger\" per se, but rather on providing unique twists and flavor combinations using a burger as base. It's a subtle distinction, but comes down to what the focus point of the meal is. We tried the Butcher's Cut, and while the patty itself was nothing extraordinary, the melding of the other ingredients/toppings made for a very tasty dinner in the end. The wife had the Chorizo burger, which was also quite good. The egg was too runny for our taste, making for a very messy meal, but the overall flavor was quite nice. The biggest food disappointment for us was the burnt marshmallow foam with the sweet potato tots. The tots were excellent, but the heat from the tots melted the marshmallow foam into a gooey mess.

We decided to go with the least expensive ticket at $75 per person since we had to buy 3. We were told we would be outside, but it would be covered, heated and have a table/seating. It would also include access to the HR Caf\u00e9 itself and the bathrooms. Luckily we had eaten prior to arriving at the HR for NYE. We were supposed to be let in at 8pm. After waiting in line the HR security finally let us in at 8:15pm. There was a very small covered area with 2 heaters. The area where the tables/seating was not covered nor were there any heaters. There was one bar and absolutely zero wait staff. We were given 2 drink tickets, but after we used those tickets we were only allowed to order from the limited bar outside. The HR had security at every door and would not allow us into the caf\u00e9, the bar inside or the store. We could only go to the bathroom and then had to leave. About 15 mins before midnight I went to the bathroom again and saw they were giving out champagne to the people inside. There was none provided outside nor were we given the option to purchase a glass. This was the only time in the night there was not security at the door guarding the caf\u00e9, so I walked into the bar and asked the bartender if I could get a couple of glasses of champagne. He looked at me in disgust and said \"yeah, if you paid for it\" and walked away. My badge clearly said \"club level\" so he knew I was not part of the $125 ticket for inside. I was completely offended. After I had just spent $100 eating there with my family on Sunday night, then another $300 for NYE. I was treated so poorly. I wasn't asking for it for free, I would have happily purchased it. I live in Nashville and am appalled that someone in our city would treat paying customers so poorly. There were 2, yes 2 heaters outside for about 100 people. It was ridiculous. Yes, we had a great view of the main stage, and yes we didn't have to fight for a bathroom, but after spending $400 at the HR in one week I would have expected to have been treated better.

I listened to acquaintances goo and gush over the menu, wondering what the hell was so special about a place with pan-Asian cuisine.

Still, it's worth it if you have already spent five minutes trying to snipe for a parking spot.We started off with appetizers: lettuce wraps and Sichuan flatbread, which were great. The lettuce wraps do require some assembly and therefore can get a little messy, but it's worth it. My entree of Chengdu Spiced Lamb could have been better, but because it's only one of two lamb dishes on their menu, it doesn't appear to be a specialty, as far as I know.The service was pleasant and prompt; I don't remember my beer glass to be empty for too long.The impressive part of the night came when we had to split the tab (ah, the joys of business travel and separate checks). There were six of us paying for our individual entrees, but five of us splitting the appetizers because we weren't letting my friend pay.

It makes for good picking and conversing, especially if you wash it all down with some cocktails. There are some fancy cocktails on the menu, which are worth trying (the Asian Bloody Mary \u00a0- I don't know its exact name, is really good for brunch), but I think PF Chang's, for some reason, makes the best gin and tonic I've ever had. Sounds silly, but don't knock it 'til you've tried it.Some favorites of mine on the menu are: the ahi tuna appetizer (which is huge and is more like a salad than an appetizer), the double pan fried noodles with tofu, the sea-bass, the spring rolls, and the cheesecake (seriously, they have a great cheesecake).

Being hungry and having waited a while for our entrees, I didn't send it back and I wasn't disappointed, just very full. The sauce was piquant, full of both taste and heat.

I'm giving this bar only two stars because of the extremely rude and non-attentive service we received. The waitress was non-attentive and oblivious to us. I had to go to the bar and grab some menus myself after waiting for 20min for a waitress to show up. 10 minutes after grabbing the menus, we flagged down a waitress. One member in our party wanted a chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce, and the waitress said we couldn't do that (how you can't swap out ranch for buffalo I'm not sure), so we asked another staff member and they said no problem. The bloody Mary's looked delicious, and when one member of our party ordered one it came non mixed and with no condiments. So once again, we went to the bar and asked for something...this time a piece of celery. The food arrived, most of it anyway, and was pretty good. Typical bar food. One member of our party waited over an hour for her sandwich to arrive. When she questioned the waitress if she put the order in, she gave a blank stare and said \"yes\". So we waited, and still no food. Finally another 20min pass, and a runner brings the sandwich. We asked what took so long, and she gave a really smart response of \"have you seen how many people are here? We can't cook everyone's food at the same time.\" And then she quickly turned around and walked off.The waitress returned, and we asked for a manager. She said \"Melissa\" was the manager, and that she would be over to our table. A few minutes later, and older gentleman came to our table, and we explained our experience to him. He was equally rude, and told us that they were busy today because of the packer game. He did kind of apologize, but then he asked if we wanted him to fire the girl that was rude to us. We were shocked by that comment, said no, but that we felt some training on customer service might be needed.I get it, I was a waitress, they were busy. But, it's not like we the highest of expectations. Just be friendly and attentive. If it's a long wait for things, be nice and explain that.

Just don't wear your Sunday best.

Something. Not the best, but not the worst. The dumplings are pretty good. Standard dumplings. I got some of the fried donuts as well. Can't really go wrong with deep fried buns tossed in sugar.

I have only here once and the food was okay. At first when we arrived we did not have a reservation and I noticed that there were big casks outside of the restaurant that look like liquor was in them. I did ask the hostess if there were actual liquor in the castle she said The casts were just for show. I did have four people eating with me and our waiter was actually really nice and accommodating he really knew the menu well and he had a good selection of things that he recommended without us having to ask him for recommendations. We did not get any of the appetizers here I ordered a double shot of Jack straight and the two other people I was with got Jack and cokes and the other person I was with just got a beer. The waiter did say that the brisket was highly recommended. Two of the people I was with had a hard time choosing between getting the ribs or the brisket both of them ended up settling on the brisket. Me on the other hand I ended up getting a smoked Gouda cheeseburger with bacon and brisket on top The burger was garnished with crispy onion straws. When I receive the burger it looked absolutely amazing. I was very excited to try this burger. I took my first bite into the burger and I noticed that the burger was just okay there wasn't a tremendous amount of flavor from the burger. What I did taste was the onion straws the smoked Gouda cheese and the brisket. The brisket on top of the cheeseburger actually tasted very good. Knowing what I do now if I did eat here again I would just ask for brisket. One of the people that I was with that just got the brisket and it up substituting his side for macaroni and cheese. He told me he wished that he didn't get the macaroni and cheese because it was extremely dry. I tasted some of the macaroni and cheese and it was not something that I would've eaten. They definitely had it sitting for a while and they just reheated it quickly. I have had better microwavable macaroni and cheese then the macaroni and cheese that they had. I did think that my burger was a little bit expensive it was $19 for the burger with the brisket. I know you're having brisket to it but it was really only three pieces of brisket and if you charge a dollar for each strip of brisket. It's still a $16 burger. The one issue I did have was that they do not have a bathroom inside of the restaurant. I ended up having to walk through the entire restaurant go outside in the hall and walk down the hallway to go use the public restroom. Overall I did enjoy the ambience of this restaurant.

My favorite was Georgia Brown which is an English-style Brown Ale from Sweetwater, GA., however, some of my peers were enjoying the local Tennessee-brewed Yazoo Hefeweizen. For food, I kept it simple and started with an order of Jack's Honey Rolls lathered with Honey Butter and Sea Salt. They're a soft and yummy way to start any meal. Keeping with the Jack-theme, I tried Jack's Burger ($15) with Angus Beef, Cheese, Bacon, Jalapenos, Grilled Onions, and Mushrooms. For an extra kick, I doubled-up on the Jalapenos and recommend doing so if you like a spicy and juicy burger.Service wasn't the best, but it was ok.

I really enjoyed the rustic, country western feel of the place. Its a fairly smaller restaurant compared to the other restaurants in the hotel though, with a decent amount of seating.They have a minimum amount of items to choose from on the menu all being down on the farm type country food, such as steaks with butter, fried chicken, fried green tomato's, mac and cheese... you probably get the gist and most everything was priced slightly more on the expensive sideSome of my fellow co workers had ate here the day before and mentioned how good the steak were. So in carnivore mode, I decided to splurge and go for the steak for $37.00 It comes with your choice of two sides which I chose the mac and cheese and fried green tomato's.My server was extremely friendly and attentive while serving me and always made sure my glass of water was full and always checked to see if there was anything I needed while my wait for my steak. Super plus!!My steak finally arrived smothered in butter and looking quite appealing ( \u00a0I have never had butter on my steak before so I was in for a treat.)I had my steak cooked medium rare and it was cooked perfectly and seasoned wonderfully! And the butter certainly was an indulgent that my stomach later didn't agree with but it was hand down delish. The mac and cheese was good but not great, I could only have a few bites because how rich it was. The fried green tomato's were also nothing special and definitely my least favorite of the dish. I came here another time with a few co workers who also tried the steak and liked. The second time I ate here, I ordered the steak again and it was great however, the server this time was a bitch, so I ended up asking for another waitress and got the nice one from the previous night. One other disappointment was I ordered a salad this time instead of the two sides and when I got my salad it was literally half of a cabbage sliced in half sprinkled with bacon and little tomato's on the side....Really? I asked my server if they have actual greens and she looked at me and smiled and said nope sorry. Yeah.Overall, I really enjoyed my two steaks I had here. I liked the atmosphere and found its rustic charm appealing and entertaining ( they also play live music there on the weekends) The service ( for the most part with my server) was sincere and friendly, not so much with the others.

When I first arrived and was helped by various airport and hotel employees, I found the accent absolutely charming and it made me smile and feel like I was in a different world.

But if you compare this Chinese buffet against the competition in Nashville, it easily deserves 4 out of 5 stars.Most of the sushi except one or two dishes were sub-par. However the sub-par items generally found throughout the entire buffet aren't bad by all means. Most of the items were in fact decent for Nashville standards. The best items in the entire restaurant are against the back wall where most of the grilled items are found, including the 'choose your own ingredients' Mongolian BBQ. However I suggest to everyone to stay away from their Teriyaki sauce (way, way too sweet). Stick to the soy sauce, it's much more tolerable (unless you like your Mongolian BBQ to be overly sweet).The shrimp and fish items do not taste old or stale, which is quite surprising for Chinese buffet standards. While it's certainly not the best seafood in town, I can easily say that the coconut shrimp was much better than most shrimp dishes offered at non-buffet Chinese restaurants in Nashville. I personally stuck to that and various chicken items and grilled BBQ pork near the Mongolian BBQ area.For those who don't like Asian buffet items, you'll always find the random pizza slices somewhere. I personally did not like the dessert options available, but I rarely go to Chinese buffets for the desserts. $8.99 per person without drinks, before tax and tip.

Now generally one does not go to an all-you-can-eat buffet for quality (especially if the price is $6.99/lunch, and that's before the coupon I used), but it's actually not bad. It's ten or twenty times larger than Golden Coast, and while there's not as much \"traditional\" or \"dim sum\" items as GC, let's face it, Golden Coast wasn't very golden in that respect either. If someone from Japan or China came to visit this buffet place, they probably would not recognize most of the items being served, but hey, Americanized Asian food can be tasty too.There is a \" Mongolian\" grill section with foods cooked-to-order, a sushi bar, an ice cream cooler, a fruit / desserts bar, and then about 8 islands of hot foods. From a vegetarian perspective, the options are more limited, but you can definitely make a very full meal with your basic Americanized \"Asian buffet\" spread. Here's what was available on a Saturday lunch for vegetarians: \u00a0spring rolls (the thin skin was crispy, hot, and overall surprisingly decent), fried donuts (like a mini-funnel cake), mei fun, chow mein noodles, fried rice, vegetable delight (broccoli, waterchestnut, lettuce), string beans, spinach with cheese, sauteed potatoes, sweet corn, inari with seaweed, veggie sushi (not labeled, just have to choose carefully, but it's usually the one with lots left as the non-vegetarians have grabbed the fish ones), fried plantains (not very good), fried zucchini (disappointing), mac & cheese (actually not too bad), cheese pizza (I didn't even try...), onion rings (decent!), french fries, garlic bread, sesame balls (a \"dim sum\" item I suppose), assorted salads, cut fruits (watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, oranges), and tons of desserts (cookies, cakes, ice cream, etc).

(and it's a buffet I can't expect too much).I have come here for Dinner with the family and lunch on my own. My latest visit was a solo lunch close to 1pm. The restaurant was fairly busy with a mix of families and work-lunch goers like myself. I was seated right away and offered a drink. I proceeded to grab my first few items, starting with the sushi bar. I was disappointed to find a mix of mostly imitation crab style rolls, and a few with cheap veggies and cream cheese. I grabbed a few that looked okay and moved onto the hot bars. Being that I don't eat any meat other than fish, this was challenging. For those who enjoy meat dishes, there are plenty. A lot of tasty looking chicken dishes both traditional Chinese/ Japanese fare and American fried foods as well. You have your run of the mill cream cheese won ton which I enjoyed, and some different items like a meat carving station which I thought was a nice touch for such an inexpensive buffet.They offer as the name indicates a Hibachi style grill, the crowd was a bit much, so I didn't partake this time around. I opted for some veggie dishes, noodles and rice all were hot and had good flavor. Each of the hot bars appeared to be fresh and the items recently rotated, I noticed there was an attendant each time I went up tending to them and cleaning the counters. On my next round I checked the sushi bar again, still lacking, many empty spots so i skipped it and grabbed another small plate of a few choice items on the hot bar. Finally at my third attempt the Sushi Chef had placed a few rolls on the bar worth trying, salmon and tuna included. I enjoyed both. This buffet is ideal if you are looking for a busy place with quick turn over of foods, I don't see how anything could \"sit\" for very long here as the crowds keep it fresh.

While there is a plethora of good Mexican places in the neighborhood (El Jalicience quickly becoming my favorite), Las Fiestas has been recommended most often for breakfast. There are few things in the world that get me as excited as a breakfast burrito (one of the worlds most perfect foods as far as I'm concerned) so I knew I was going to have to check this place out. The decor is \"meh\" at best. It looks like they picked up their dining sets from an old hotel that was letting go of their continental breakfast area. We went on a Sunday morning and the place was empty. For most of our dining experience We were the only people in the restaurant. And let me take a guess at why: They were BLASTING TV preacher Joel Osteen on the two large screen TVs. In addition to the unwanted religion I was getting with my burrito, they were playing salsa music over the televised church service. I'm all about mashups, but this was downright annoying. If I wanted to hear a sermon, I would spend my Sunday morning in church. I wanted a burrito, which has nothing to do with Christianity in the slightest. My one major recommendation for this restaurant would be to show sports/music videos on the TVs on MUTE, and play the salsa music in the background. We started out with our morning coffee. It was fresh, but unremarkable. It tasted very much like typical bottom-less cup diner coffee.But we were there for the burritos, and boy did we get them. Las Fiestas' breakfast menu is pretty traditional American/Southern stuff, with the exception of the Burrito Loco. The Loco is filled with eggs, your choice of chorizo, bacon or beef, topped with pico and queso. Since I'm not a big queso fan, I asked for salsa verde instead. This burrito was MASSIVE, filling, and very tasty. For the price, you can't really beat this breakfast.Let's also talk about their home fry potatoes- possibly my favorite thing at this place. They are half circles cut thin and pan fried until almost crispy and dusted with a great mix of spices. These little slices of heaven tasted really good dipped in my leftover salsa verde. By the time we were finished eating, Reverend Osteen finished his programming and was replaced with an informercial on skin cream- which was also at full volume and not shut off.

Well if you find yourself still feeling some sushi, their nigiri is fresh and well-made, and their rolls have some novelty but never try too hard. You won't be disappointed!

You can tell that's it's a Japanese restaurant the moment you walk in. It is not trendy. The decor shows its age, but I just love how traditional it feels.

Swank, swank, swank.Off to the side, there's another room designated for hookahs complete with a second bar (only open on the weekends). And if we can talk hookah for a second, I'll just go ahead and recommend the Blue Magic (tastes like blue raspberry + heaven). The downside is the hookahs run steepish at $25/each. Also, it appears they're still working out the kinks with their hookah hookup. We arrived at 6pm and were told the hookah lounge would open in an hour. Later, we found out the \"hookah guy\" was supposed to be there at 4pm. Not that we were upset, but Brian (the GM) was so nice about it anyway, making sure to comp our pipe when another hookah competitor was chomping at the bit to save the day.On the way out, my fiance announced we'd found our new neighborhood bar. Looking forward to a pitcher of mimosas next time, I'm definitely okay with that.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 88 reviews", "date": "2013-02-21"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nJenifer G.\n", "review": "Beautiful place! \u00a0I went on a Saturday night and the place was packed. \u00a0I stayed through the set of old school the DJ played and loved having space to sing and dance (with my friends). \u00a0The bartenders were swamped and I only saw one waitress weaving through the crowd. \u00a0I had the cran-daddy, virgin mixed fruit drink, which was tangy-sweet. \u00a0I also had to sample the hand-cut fries. \u00a0I'm not convinced; they were no match for M's fries. \u00a0Anyway, people were friendly enough though like most places, mingling seemed to be minimal. \u00a0It's best to go with friends, unless you'll be at the bar, but perhaps that's a no-brainer for those of you who hang out more than I do.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 155 reviews", "date": "2013-02-24"}, {"rating": "2.0", "name": "\nAltovisse R.\n", "review": "I'm really trying to love this place. I am really trying. I have gone twice- once on a friday after work (when they first opened), and then most recently for Sunday Brunch. The first time I went, the waitress took what felt like 1,000 years to come and take my order- then once we got our food and drinks- she dissapeared for long periods of time. I got smart and ordered 2 drinks at once because I knew that I would not see her again. I gave the Wknd a pass because i'm sure opening a new establishment is hard work-and it takes time to get your staff up to Par. Round 2-several months later- I go for sunday brunch. This time was even worse. My food was decent-and my order was correct. 2 of the ladies that I was brunching with were not so lucky-everything was all wrong- one girl ended up sending her food back and cancelling all together. I asked for a glass of water to go with my Mimosa. I didn't get it. Each time my waitress came to our table (which was rare)- I asked- after I got my check- I asked- after i paid my money- I asked. I never did get my water (I was there for about 2 hours!), but I did get the luxury of paying the automatic gratuity that they add to the checks!", "location": "\nAntioch, TN\n", "exp": " 1 review", "date": "2013-06-05"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nJason M.\n", "review": "First, a disclaimer: I've heard that WKND has a totally different vibe on the, uh, weekend than it does during the week. \u00a0You can tell that the owners are really trying to keep certain riff-raff at bay since they actually have their descriptive dress code plastered all over their front doors and website.My fiance and I first heard about this place on the news - apparently having 1,000,000 pennies on the floor and bar places you in the timeslot before the weather report - but WKND has become my favorite neighborhood bar for weeknight happy hour drinking. \u00a0The place has a very chill-out feel to it; big, comfy couches are just begging to be lounged on while you drink pitchers of Long Island Iced Tea. \u00a0You read that right. \u00a0WKND offeres a variety of delicious drinks in pitcher form. \u00a0We also couldn't resist pitchers of margaritas and sangria. \u00a0They range in the $25-$35 price range, but they are actually worth it.The drinks are the main reason I love WKND. \u00a0Their Manhattans are top-notch, and you'll want to keep them coming. \u00a0In back, they have a really neat hookah lounge and a separate bar. \u00a0The hookahs are $25, which is way too expensive. \u00a0Makes me miss the old days at Aladdin's.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 9 reviews", "date": "2013-03-13"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nJenny S.\n", "review": "I really enjoyed myself here and the biggest surprise was that the Lemon Pepper chicken wings were so good!

We sat at the back bar and I ordered a grilled chicken salad. The plate that came for me was standard, bland, lunch time food. A couple pieces of lettuce, some quartered tomatoes, and a slab of reheated chicken. When my server finally came around with silverware, I received a fork wrapped in a paper napkin. Just a fork... in a paper napkin. I only emphasize this because compared to the overall ambiance, I expected something more substantial. The music was also being played so loudly it was nearly impossible for my friend & I to enjoy our conversation.
