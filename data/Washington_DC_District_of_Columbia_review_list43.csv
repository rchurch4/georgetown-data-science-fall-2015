4.5,"Hidden gem, with bogo?!","As usual, with most of the Columbia heights bars, I tend to forget about this place, which is truly only to my detriment.
Every time I come here I'm impressed with the ambiance, service, deals, food and the whole place to be honest.
While I'm not sure what this spot is like when it's not nice weather, I do know...

4.5,Unbelievable Happy Hour,"The Happy Hour here is RIDONKULOUS! Every drink--I mean EVERY drink--is BOGO (buy one, get one for the uninformed) from 5:00 until 9:00. That's right--until 9:00! And they don't have crappy rail drinks. They have EXCELLENT, really EXCELLENT bourbons, whiskeys and scotchs, among other liquors and beers. (To be fair, wine not so much, but who cares, it's not a...

4.5,Good food in a great setting,"A group of us enjoyed their back patio under the warm Saturday night. The place was hopping at the bar but the picnic style tables were comfortable.
We sampled a variety of local beers and had the skirt steak, pork belly sandwich, lamb gyro and the scallops. Apart from the scallops which were rather small, the rest of of the...

4.5,Surprisingly good food in a dive bar type atmosphere,"Okay, so I'm not American and where I live we don't have the term 'dive bar' but I've been to enough (good and bad) ones in the States to feel like I can use that word to describe an establishment with confidence. DC Reynolds was recommended to us by the locals we were staying with. We go and stand outside...

4.5,Unique and surprisingly good,"Attended a birthday celebration on the outdoor patio. Super pleasant bartenders, creating tempting mixes from scratch, including margarita's and fresh squeezed lemonade (not the fake powder stuff). Enjoyed deviled eggs with a horse radish blend topped with pork belly, fresh burger ground with bacon (inside the meat)...really cool, with a super fresh bun. French fries among the best anywhere. Met...
