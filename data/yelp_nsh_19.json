My friend ordered chicken wings with Ranch dressing. Again, simple. Right off the menu. However, when our order came, my quesadilla was plain cheese. \"Um, there's no bacon? And no chicken?\" He replied, \"Didn't you order vegetarian?\" No. No I didn't. How can you confuse bacon with vegetarian? More importantly, why would you? Bacon is delicious. I'm pretty sure I look like someone who likes bacon. Because everybody does. My friend's wings arrived sans Ranch. Actually, there was a complete lack of dressing, not even the traditional blue cheese. Asking again for Ranch yielded nothing. At this point, I think Dustin realized that we were unsatisfied but, instead of trying to fix the problem by bringing Ranch or some bacon, or refilling our water glasses, he avoided us. He would mumble something that resembled \"How are you doing?\" but he didn't even slow down, he just buzzed right by our table. We finally had to ask him for the check after being there well over an hour.

What they did not tell us is that the free pizza was only valid for 30 days. Either they left that detail out on purpose, or whoever we spoke to forgot. Just called back tonight and they essentially said there's nothing they can do.

There is a difference between a dive and a sh*thole, and this is a dive, which is fine. Anyway, the food is really what counts, and for my money (and not much of it either!) the food is really quite good and consistent. Trivia: these guys used to be in Harding Mall, back when it wasn't a Walmart, and moved up the road when it got knocked down. Anyway, food: I'm not sure what they do to their \"ranch sauce\" but it's delightful and if you get fries always go for the seasoning they offer. I generally stick to their gyro meat (a blend of lamb and beef) but the chicken is a strong choice too. The food is fresh and the staff is friendly. I would call this more \"Mediterranean\" than Greek (splitting hairs?) but mostly because the people who run it are Egyptian, so I think that brings a slightly different flavor profile to the food other than what a straight up Greek influence would.

The truth is that a celebrity chef, a menu that reads like a biology experiment, or a bar staff that is dressed like they stepped off of the Titanic is not a caveat for being a great local Nashville restaurant.Enter Fat Moes.Fat Moes was a Nashville original when Ruby Tuesdays was considered a local restaurant. Every single thing that comes off the Moes menu is delicious.Yes it is fast food. Er sorta..it takes about five or six minutes. However, just because it's fast doesnt mean it belongs lumped together with the other corporate garbage out there..In fact, you'll will question how they have not put the taco bells and bk's out of biz in the Antioch area. Unlike the aforementioned, Moe's uses actual ingredients that resemble real food..not only do the beef and chicken taste like beef and chicken should, they taste better than what some of the twenty dollar burger joints around town are offering.Also, did I mention that the menu has almost fifty items..Burgers, chicken sandwiches, CORN DOGS, philly cheesesteaks, stuffed jalapenos, mozzerella sticks, gyros, milkshakes(32oz made with ice cream and milk, not 'frosty slurry') etc. I've eaten almost all of it and have yet to reflect upon the meal as not worth every fucking penny I spent..I can't say that about all the local places floating around(looking at you barista parlour).Ontop of all this glory, the burgers and chicken sandwiches weigh about THREE POUNDS.As a final note of awesomeness, this place is not trendy..there is nary a hipster or millionare 25 year old to be seen..Which in itsself is a great reason to go..This city is trying too hard to be cool, kinda like that nerdy kid who goes out and buys Affliction brand clothing..He should have just rode it out..Same with nashville..Fat moes oozes and sweats genuine nashville.So do yourself a favor.

It's a truck that brings you delicious biscuits. Amazing!I've been working my way through the menu for the past few weeks. I first saw the Biscuit Love banner at the Franklin Farmer's Market and decided to give it a try. They were being served out of a Red Pony Catering truck and I'm a big fan of that restaurant, so was optimistic. I don't know if they are officially affiliated or what.My wife (who is obsessed with biscuits) and I decided to try one savory and one sweet to share. We ordered the Princess and the Gertie.Right after placing our order a woman walked up and looked interested. She said, \"Hm. Looks interesting. I just saw a lady over there moanin' over some of these so I thought I should come and check it out!\"The Princess is hot chicken with honey, pickles, and mustard. It wasn't nearly hot enough for my taste (and to be worthy of the \"hot chicken\" name), but it was a great combo. The sweetness of the honey is a nice complement to both the spicy chicken and the biscuit. The freshness of the pickle is a nice touch. The Gertie was way too intense. Just before they served it to me, the other customer in line was asking about it. They said, \"Oh, here's one right here if you want to see what it's like.\" The woman replies, \"Oh yes. That looks like a GREAT way to die!\" It's a single biscuit split in half. On each half is what seems like a quarter cup of homemade peanut butter and on top of that is caramelized banana \"jam\", some melted Olive and Sinclair chocolate, and crushed pretzel bits. Wow! The first 3 or 4 bites were heavenly. But, I wouldn't order it again unless I had 2 or 3 friends to share it with. It was amazingly rich and delicious, but I could not finish it. I wish they would drop the price a dollar and reduce the quantity of toppings. It would be much better.I also recently noticed that they are joining the Sunday line-up over at Elmington Park off West End. Went back and tried something a little more tame. Ordered the biscuit with blackberry jam and lemon curd. Wow! Now this one is just right. It has just the right amount of tasty topping. The zesty lemon pairs perfectly with the tart and sweet blackberry and buttery biscuit. I will definitely get this one again.Also decided to just try a biscuit plain. They seemed good, but smothered with everything else it was hard to tell for sure. When I ordered it, they said, \"You just want it plain? No butter or anything?... Okay. Yikes, that's a lot of pressure.\" No worries. It's fantastic. I'll probably buy a half dozen plain biscuits the next time I stop by.The prices are a touch high, but it's worth it.The one thing they really need is a much more visible sign. The logo and colors are very cute, but it's difficult to see from a distance. I suggested they get a huge banner with the word \"biscuits\" to face West End when they are over there on the weekend.

Facebook, maybe? I think. I'm not sure, but I somehow knew about them and knew that my next trip to Nashville would require a trip to get a biscuit. That simple. We spoke via Twitter and I headed over while there last week. And let me be extremely clear: I recently paid WAY too much for biscuits at a restaurant owned by a world-renowned chef. These biscuits - from the back of a truck - were exponentially better. These biscuits were as good as my mama's. And please understand that my mama's biscuits are the ones by which all other biscuits are judged.I tried the Princess (based on Nashville's famous Prince's Hot Chicken), which has a piece of spicy fried chicken, drizzled with local honey and topped with hand-made grain mustard and homemade pickles. It was serious. I also had the East Nasty, topped with buttermilk fried chicken, Kenny's Farmhouse cheddar cheese and a homemade sausage gravy. Ummm... That one was ridiculous. I wanted to propose, but since the owners are married (to each other), it certainly seemed out of place. I might have been in heaven the whole time. I'm not sure. It was an out-pf-body experience. I saw the white light and everything. Because I am a glutton, I tried the \"Bonuts\" for dessert and let me say that NYC's famous \"Cronut\" has nothing on this sucker. Made from the leftover biscuit dough (the parts left over after the biscuit cutter has done its job), the bonut has a flakey exterior and layers of flavor inside. Mine were filled with a lemon curd cream and sat atop homemade strawberry marmalade. Seriously, is there anything they serve that is mass-produced? I asked. The answer is no. Biscuit Love Truck is a must-stop for foodies, with buttermilk coming from Cruze Farms, spices coming from Chef Lior Lev Sercarz, freshly-milled wheat and so forth. I suggest you follow them on Twitter (@BiscuitLuvTruck) and go wherever they are, get a biscuit. No, make that, get a couple of biscuits, and eat till your heart is content.Oh, and I forgot to mention: price-wise they're dead-on.

It finally happened last Friday. We drove all the way over to Cool Springs from Smyrna. Side note: there is no direct route to Cool Springs from Smyrna. You either have to take this wind-y backroad or drive all the way down to 840 or 96 or all the way up to Old Hickory Boulevard. There is no really good way to get there. Anyway...back on track. Drove all the way over there. My husband wanted the East Nasty, but they had already sold out of that, so he settled on something that had pork tenderloin and chili verde sauce (I can't remember the name, so pardon the less-than-eloquent description). I ordered The Princess. I had read the review that said they had fruit tea, and I was super excited about that...but they only had sweet tea that day. I've lived in the south all my life, so that's no big, but still. So we get our food. Fellow Yelpers, you were spot on about the chicken. It was SO. GREASY. I couldn't even eat it. I couldn't even really enjoy the biscuit. That was basically $8 down the drain. Yeah. The thing is $8. My husband's was $10. He liked it all right, but he said it was definitely not $10 worth of food. Now the sweet tea? was phenomenal. They used waaaay too much sugar, which is just the way I like it. I really hate that I can't give a better review. We got great service. The lady that took our order was really sweet. However, if you are going to serve over-priced food, at least make GOOD over-priced food.

Biscuits? In a truck? Yes please! After much deliberation I chose the East Nasty. I proudly walked my biscuit sandwich back toward our booth and presented my husband with my wonderful find. Fried chicken! Gravy! Cheese! Biscuit! Hooray!I chose to use a fork to eat my meal. I started picking apart the chicken, and I swear I couldn't find an edible bite in the whole piece. I'll echo a few other sad reviews when I say that my chicken seemed like a big slab of fried fat.Ok, I'm an optimist. I still have gravy, cheese, and a biscuit. That's still a hearty meal! I snatched up a piece of the biscuit, and... my god, it was horrible. I implored my husband to try a bite. \"There's something wrong with that,\" he said. I know! What is it? Stale? Chewy? Completely missing an ingredient? Something was horribly wrong with this biscuit. I was NOT in biscuit love. I was in biscuit hell.So what do I do? You can't eat gravy for dinner. I was so, so disappointed. I contemplated asking for a refund, or maybe just asking for a trade-off of sweet tea, but by this time there was a line of about 30 people outside the truck and I didn't want to wait nor cause a scene in front of anyone. Maybe I just got a bad batch of food.. Even if the chicken OR biscuit had been good, I would have gladly just eaten that. But for BOTH to be horrible, I just can't explain that. Had we been at a restaurant, I would have had a refund or something different. The unique food truck experience means that I paid $8 for something in edible that I threw away.

The reviews were overwhelming so I could not resist going there. We had some small sausages for an app. They were served hot off the grill were good. Only so much you can do with just meat though. The Chicken Cordon Bleu was fantastic (we split it)! The best that I have ever had!!! And the mashed potatoes are to die for. We met the owner and she is very nice. It was just my wife and I in the restaurant and she turned down the lights, lit candles and put on some music. Wow. A tip to the owner, some indirect lighting, some nice curtains on the windows , and kill the lights on the fridge and you will have a very romantic place!

Standout dishes were the homemade sausages we had for an appetizer--great, and the burek(spelling?) with a white cream sauce--great. And, yes, the pita bread is good but it's just out of a bag.It was really my mistake about that I ordered (the cabbage rolls) because I thought \"gravy\" would be a meat-based brown sauce but it's actually tomato-based and I don't like tomato sauce. Also, with the lamb chops there's an extra charge for the white sauce but actually it's pretty mild and didn't really add to the dish.The biggest problem was the timing of our meal. We waited quite a while for the appetizer and the main courses came out immediately within seconds, except for one of us who got our dinner about 5 minutes later.

The restaurant also serves 'American' food, so it was a good match for my brother's girlfriend and her family members who came along and are more used to eating at Cracker Barrel. Her dad ordered the burger, and was later tempted to eat some of the new cake cooked up by the chef - so new that it has no official name, but is just called creamy pecan cake or something to that effect. He cleaned his plate and even tried a piece of my brother's baklava. But, more to the point - most of the folks at the table of 8 ordered the schintzel and were very happy with it. There are two varieties - breaded and non-breaded. One is the Jaeger and the other is the Wiener, I think. You can get your choice of two sides, and one of the home made sauces. Each plate was brought to our table hot off the stove and all of it was freshly made. It was delicious, authentic and served in large portions. What really put this restaurant over the top, though, was the chef and the atmosphere she created in this small but cozy storefront restaurant that is easy to miss. She was so friendly and new every customer who came in while we were there by name. Her welcoming nature, careful attention to detail, offers of free desert samples to entice the weary American food fans to try some strange sounding treat like baklava, and her wonderful cooking skills are sure to please. My brother, who is in the restaurant biz, commented afterward that the chef really just needs to get more folks coming through her doors for the first time, and she'll build a large clientele - because one you try the delicious, fresh food which is so reasonably priced and served with such friendliness, you will become a regular customer.", "location": "\nNew York, NY\n", "exp": " 8 reviews", "date": "2009-10-09"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nAnton V.\n", "review": "Great tasting food from a wonderful chef. \u00a0I just love small restaurants where you know who's cooking the food, and feel welcome when you come in the door.", "location": "\nDavidson, TN\n", "exp": " 16 reviews", "date": "2009-07-28"}], "num_reviews": 68, "address": "\n            5751 Old Hickory BlvdHermitage, TN 37076\n        "}, {"rating": 4.5, "name": "Nashville Night Life", "phone": "6158855201", "url": "/biz/nashville-night-life-nashville", "reviews": [{"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nTonya M.\n", "review": "This was my 1st night in Nashville and this was a great start.

Drinks and dessert are included in the price, but beer/wine is extra.The decor is very dated and has the feel of a mom and pop local venue just trying to scrape by. \u00a0 I initially saw that as a negative, but as the lights dimmed and the show began, I realized that it added to the hometown charm of the Nashville Night Life.The show itself was exactly what one would expect at a tourist venue, \u00a0good and bad. \u00a0Each of the performers played to the crowd with a forced sense of enthusiasm that made me question their sincerity. \u00a0They all seemed to be former band members or backup singers of renowned country stars, and each of them were hawking their CDs in the back. \u00a0In this age of auto tune and the plethora of competition singing shows, it's easy to be critical of such performers.But as the night wore on, I came to realize that they were pretty amazing musicians and singers. \u00a0I found myself clapping and singing along to some of the numbers. \u00a0If you look at if from a sheer economic viewpoint, the buffet was probably worth about $14.95. \u00a0Was the show worth $25? In a town where there is free music on every corner? It's certainly debatable, but what is not debatable is the fact that I had a FANTASTIC time at the Nashville Night Life. \u00a0Sure, it's a tourist attraction, but if you know that going in, you will have a good time.Would I go again?

We were both super excited about going there for dinner. Though, there were last minute changes because City House couldn't host a party of 25 so the venue quickly changed to Giovanni's a day before. My husband told me about the change and pulled up the menu for Giovanni's for me to review online. Boy was I floored! The ungodly price on just the salad itself was ridiculous? What person on this Earth would pay $12.75 for iceberg lettuce salad with a sprinkle of pancetta, shallots, and a light gorgonzola dressing? Seriously, for the amount of money you spend on a salad, you better load it up with all kinds of fat to make that worth my taste buds! Where should I begin on where this restaurant went so wrong in many ways than one.1. Soup of the day. The soup of the day was carrot soup with mussels. The carrot soup was garnished with 3 mussels. Yes! 3 mussels swimming in this \"delicious\" carrot soup. For a cool price of $9.75. (Yeah! Don't let the online menu fool you. Add a dollar to each price because apparently from then to now they umped the price.) I could've made this soup for less than $10 for my 15 month old and last for the whole week for under $10 with just 2 stops and 45 minutes of my time in the kitchen! Trader Joe's organic bag of carrots: $2.99. K&S Market for mussels: $4.99lb (Fresh might I add.) Carrots washed, peeled, steamed for 15 minutes, and with the use of my wonderful Magic Bullet and BAM! --- Carrot soup! Let's not forget to garnish the carrot soup with yummy mussels. As many mussels to one's taste, YES! That means more than 3 mussels that Giovanni provided for their \"amazing\" soup of the day!2. Entree.\"Ravioli di came al pomodoro fresco e mozzrella di bufala\". Sounds fancy, huh? HARDLY! Let me break this down to you, Chef Boyardee's ravioli is better than what this restaurant had to offer. Oh yeah, for the price you spend at a wonderful $24.50, you can purchase 9 cans worth of Chef Boyardee's and be set for 3 meals a day for 3 days out of a week. So for 3 pieces of these overly sized round pasta, stuffed with what I thought tasted like dog food, but really it was just minced ground beef. (YUCK!) To be honest, I don't even know if it was real ground beef. Mystery meat, I'll go for that? Moving on...Pasta sauce was bland. It tasted like tomato paste, watered down. All this \"yumminess\" garnished with 3 measly pieces of buffalo mozzarella cheese. Awesome! -- NOT!3. Side dishes.Maccheroni allo Speck. In latent terms: Mac and Cheese with Speck and Peas. Now, the mac and cheese was really good. Then again, it's hard to go wrong with mac and cheese. If nothing looks appetizing on the menu, go for the mac and cheese. I know, I know! $9.75 for mac and cheese when you can make that at home yourself and have an endless amount of leftovers for the next few days is pretty expensive. Though, $9.75 versus anything else on the menu, this is relatively cheap and fulfilling! At least once you get the bill it will be under $15.4. Drinks!Okay. From the time we arrived which was about 7PM all the way to around 10:30PM, I had ordered a Coca Cola and asked for water as well. There was ample of refills on the water. Of course, our server was a bit squirrelly and allowed my glass go empty several times before I received a refill, not ONCE did I receive a refill on my Coca Cola. Not that I'm that type for constant refills, but the amount of time I stayed there, you'd think I'd get a second refill, but noooo. Not even once did the server asked if I wanted a refill on my Coca Cola. You'd think I was drinking Cristal.To end this wonderful birthday dinner party gone wrong many ways than one, we were told by the absentminded server that all orders will be on 1 ticket! Say that again, please? I think I just heard you incorrectly. No No! I didn't. All orders will be on 1 ticket! Not only did we have to sit there and separate all 18 orders, when we got down to the bottom of the ticket, they tacked on a cake cutting fee charge of $60! Say what?! Damn right, we brought in our own cake for the birthday girl and they charged us a cake cutting fee! And because they failed to mention the fee over the phone ... did they take the charge off? Hell no! For the amount my husband and I spent here, we could've gone to Antonio's and had superb service and beyond excellent, authentic Italian food!Here, I just felt like I had just been raped by the overly priced meals and then some by these hidden fee charges.

Pretty sure it would have covered my mortgage payment for the month of October. I can only marginally review the price/value/flavor because I don't know what everyone ordered. So this will mostly be about my personal experience, which was good but didn't knock my socks off.* The Godfather: champagne with Aperol and an orange slice. TASTY. * Caprese for the entire table: The only caprese I've ever lost my mind over is at Saffire. This one was good but nothing special.* Mac and cheese with speck and peas: retarded tasty. Also retarded small. And retarded TEN DOLLARS. For about six bites. Way, WAY overpriced. And just as a matter of presentation? Don't bring out a half-full ramekin. It looks like you're ripping off the patron even if you aren't. (My husband bought me a package of speck at Costco the next day so I can try to replicate this without ending up in the poor house.)* Nobilo Sauvignon Blanc 2008: one of my favorite wines. I can buy a bottle at our local shop for $13.99. I can buy a glass at Giovanni's for $13.50. You do the math.* Filet style ribeye, prepared Tuscan style and served with roasted potatoes: You need to know this about me going in. If there is an option for steak, I will almost always order it. I love steak. This was one of the steak specials. It probably cost $800; I have no idea. It was good, but it wasn't life-changing. I'm not sure the olive oil and herb marinade did anything for it. I really couldn't tell anything but that it was a good cut of slightly charred ribeye (I like a good caramelization, but I don't like getting the occasional taste of charcoal). If I had served those roasted potatoes to my Brit husband, I would be off the island so fast it's not even funny. Not crispy enough! And presentation was a little meh. * Dessert: some chocolate souffle thing with a melty center. I don't like dessert. I didn't even try it.Service was very good. Staff members were attentive but didn't hover (and there were a lot of them for a barely occupied restaurant). Ambience was nice. Did I mention the entire upstairs was empty and the downstairs was only sparsely seated? I did? Never mind.Our entire table seemed very happy with their food. Plates were mostly empty; talk was animated; laughs all around. That's what you want for a nice dinner out with friends. On that count, great success! We were all full and happy when we left. That's nothing to complain about. I will consider trying Giovanni's again, but since there are so many stellar restaurants in the Nashville area, it might be a while. I've had a few of those restaurant experiences that I couldn't shut up about, a place I was dying to go back to for whatever reason. Sadly, Giovanni's didn't do this for me. It was overpriced, and the food was just okay, not terribly memorable.

He was very friendly but it was kind of a strange question to ask because, I mean, if I wanted my photo taken, I would have asked myself. We ordered the \"quattro formaggio\" pot as our appetizer - came with apples, veggies, and bread. It was actually pretty good! Really cheesy and went really well with the bread & veggies. We also each ordered caesar salads - the salads were pretty good but for some reason, they added candied pinenuts to the salad. The candied pinenuts were disgusting - I feel like a caesar salad is meant to be a salty salad so it was a strange mixture adding the sweetness to it...Did. Not. Like. That. For the entrees, we settled for the Seasoned Court Bouillon. With that broth, we chose the: spinach ravioli, potstickers, andouille sausage, sirloin, shrimp, and duck. Six dipping sauces came with the meal, as well. Some sauces were good, others weren't. It seemed that none of the sauces really worked well with the ravioli so I had to ask our waitress for some pesto on the side. Our waitress was very sweet, enthusiastic, and friendly. She was great.

This place is so corporate, I would expect them to force their servers to wear flare. Everything is super scripted, the menu is a disaster, and you cook your own food.

It looked like something I would have put together in the 6th grade for a snack. The entrees are even worse. There is no rhyme or reason to what sauces they serve with the dinner. We ordered chicken pot stickers, and it came out with the following dipping sauces: blue cheese, spinach dip, coconut curry, and miso ginger. The only sauce there that remotely complements pot stickers is the miso ginger, and that tasted like it came straight out of a bottle I could have bought at Kroger. The dessert consisted of a few slices of banana, strawberry, mini brownies and \"pound cake,\" with a pot of melted chocolate. Again, the quality of the brownies and pound cake were on par with the pre-packaged bites you would buy in the Kroger deli. To recap: you could purchase everything for this meal at Kroger for way less than they charge you at the Melting Pot, and either way you have to cook it for yourself.

From a novelty perspective and \"neat\" perspective, it is probably really cool to 90% of people as 90% of folk in America don't cook these days and if they do, it is to the extent of boiling some noodles and throwing ragu on top of it.We had the full 3 courses of fondue. The cheese course was neat, but nothing more than cheese dip in a fondue bowl that you dip your bread and other items in. The meat course was simply cooking seasoned meat in the boiling bouillon and then dipping in a sauce if desired. Lastly, the desert round was simply melted chocolate with assorted deserts (which were amazing).All of this rambling is to say, that if you don't cook a lot or know how to cook, you'll probably give the food a 5/5 and the price a 5/5.

My family and I went on fathers day. If it were any day other that fathers day it would have been twice as expensive. We paid $40/person. This include an appetizer, all you can eat dinner, and desert. The appetizer is just cheese and hard bread. Shredded cheese that they mix with Natural Ice. For a supposed high end restaurant why are they using cheap beer. With as many local breweries in Nashville would it not be hard to do something special, maybe some Yazoo, Hap'n Harry's, or Blackstone. \u00a0This is just one example as to why they are nothing special. No worries I have more to share. \u00a0 For dinner you are able to choose from different cooking styles. When I hear cooking, especially when it pertains to meat (such as Filet Mignon,) I'm thinking its going on the grill. No, no thats not what happens. Instead you choose what would better be named as \"what broth should you boil your high dollar meat in.\" With several different cuts of meat I was excited. Up until I had to submerge the meat into a vat of broth, and wait for it to cook. One broth is complimentary, and the other two that are offered are an additional cost. The table also has to agree on one cooking style. I have already been waiting. I do not want to wait any longer. If I wanted to cook my own food I would do so at home. At home where its not going to cost me an arm and a leg. Finally desert. I don't know about you, but in my opinion desert is what caps the meal off. Its what I wait for. If it were carb less I would have desert for all three courses. The idea of dipping different things in melted chocolate sounds amazing. I like chocolate and guess what, I like different things too. When they come together I'm thinking, \"Oh boy, I am in for a treat.\" In this case those things aren't anything special. No treat here, move along. If you want to try this, get your self a bottle of Hershey syrup and warm it up in a sauce pan. Take a few skewers and poke them through sliced pound cake, about 6 sliced strawberries, a couple of banana slices, pineapple pieces, and a couple of marshmallows. Like I said, nothing special. Why not use cheesecake? Instead of tiny strawberries, how about big juicy strawberries? Pineapple is a plus on any palette, but why do I only get 4 small pieces. WHY ARE YOU WITH HOLDING THE PINEAPPLE!?? Marshmallows are nothing special either, keep them and give me more pineapple.The service was also sub par. We waited a while for drink refills. We waited a while on our waiter when we sat down. We actually had two, the waiter seemed like he was in a bad mood and annoyed with us. The waitress how ever was very nice and quite attentive. We ended up talking to a manager, and he was accommodating to our complaint. Which was actually not that big of a deal until the waiter decided to get an attitude. The decor was nice, a lot of stone work which I thought was awesome. On the down side it was a little dark and it lacked natural lighting. It had a dungeon feel to it. The booths were way to cushiony, I swear I sank down about 3ft when I sat down. Not a lot of lumbar support.We had a group of 7 and paid around $350 (tip included.) We had three men with us and each one received a $25 gift card to use on our next trip, as well as a free gift. The free gift consisted of a money clip (they were out,) a hand towel (now sitting in my floor board,) a golf ball, and a jar of their house spice. All in all, I would not return. Not even to use the gift card. For such a high dollar restarant it lacks in a lot of ways. I feel like they need to do something that sets them apart.

Yes, it is a chain. Yes, they have the option to \"cook\" your own food, and yes, it can be pricey, but it is ALL worth it. It's an experience. Granted, probably not a pleasurable experience for people who's normal idea of a special dinner is going to Golden Corral. I've been here on 3 different occasions and each one has been memorable. The staff has always been very courteous and polite. I like that the restaurant sits underground. It's very relaxing with a great ambience without being cheesy. They have a few different options for meals. You can do just a cheese fondue, a cheese fondue, then meat, then a dessert fondue, or just a dessert fondue. They may have entrees but I really don't know. Who comes to a fondue place and doesn't order fondue?? I'm pretty sure you get a salad before any of the courses. I don't pay much attention because I'm always eagerly awaiting the cheese fondue to get going! They make all the fondues right at your table. You get to see all the ingredients being used. They have several different options for each type of fondue and they gladly explain all of them to you. With the cheese fondue you get a variety of raw veggies and breads to dip along with Granny Smith apples. YUM. If you choose to do the meat course (which I STRONGLY RECOMMEND) then you get to choose which type of broth you want your meat cooked in. They set that up right at your table as well. The meats are absolutely delicious. The options I can remember are chicken, pork, tiger shrimp, filet mignon............. Probably more but that's what I can remember at the moment. The meat comes to you raw and seasoned and they explain to you how long to cook each type in the broth. For those of you complaining about cooking your own food, get over it. It's really not hard. You stab the meat with your stick and sit it, stick and all, in the broth for a couple of minutes. The end. When it's finished you take it out and top it with one of the amazing sauces that are made to accompany each type of meat and you eat it. Then you moan because it IS THAT DANG GOOD. Repeat process until all meat is gone while wondering why you have never cooked meat like this at home. Let's move on to the dessert fondue. You would think that the dessert fondue would automatically be the bast part of the meal. But honestly, I can't really say that. Don't get me wrong, it's absolutely divine and I LOVE ME SOME DESSERTS. It's just that EVERY course here is amazing. Seriously. There are several options for the chocolate fondue. Smores, peanut butter, caramel, white chocolate, dark chocolate, etc. They bring you brownies, bananas, strawberries, cheesecake, Rice Krispy treats, angel food cake and more to dip in the fondue. Take my advice and REALLY cherish that first bite. While that first bite is melting in your mouth everything is right with the world. There is no war, no starving children in Africa, you're not in debt, you haven't just gained 15 lbs since the meal started, your child doesn't wet the bed, and your dream of becoming a country music sensation REALLY WILL COME TRUE. Now, after that first bite you may feel like a gluttonous pig but that won't stop you from devouring every last drop. Trust me. Overall, The Melting Pot is a great place for special occasions and I believe even the naysayers will enjoy it if they just get over themselves and try it.

Well, I know how to cook and I saved my pennies throughout the year! Put on your best outfit and let's go!!!I've have two different fondue experiences at The Melting Pot. Both were equally satisfying. Very romantic feel, laid back and good music.I'm not going to go deep into details about my experiences, but yet, I'm going to take a different approach. Guys, this is a place to take your chick! You want to impress your woman? You want to get some cool points? This is the place to do so! Right here!Great wine selections. Make sure you order by the bottle instead of by the glass. It's much cheaper that way.Your fondue experience kicks off with the cheese fondue with all the breads, veggies and apples. Take your fondue fork and get to dipping! The cheese is so good! I think it's called the Beer Cheese Fondue that we tried. After your cheese fondue, you get your salad while your broth is boiling on the table. Then all the excitement begins when the raw chicken, steak, shrimp, duck and pork is brought to your table! Stab your different selections of meats with your fork, put it in the pot and let it sit there for a couple of minutes. Everything you put in and take out of that pot will make you shake your head in shame. How can that broth make everything so good?? I don't get it. It's some of the best food i've ever had. I can't even describe it like most people can, so ill just try my best. It's so good! Then the chocolate fondue. I'm not really big on sweets but i really enjoyed the experience. Strawberries and brownies to dip. It's a great ending to a romantic evening.Although the Melting Pot is one of the best restaurants i've ever experienced, it's something I can't do every month...more like annually. Special occasions like anniversaries or that first date with a chick you just met and want to impress! Haha!

Once as a Valentine's Day present from my husband (my first time ever there), and the other time as a gift to my parents since they had never been. Both times were completely wonderful. Our waiter (first trip) and waitress (second trip) were both amazing. First trip we got the Big Night Out, 4 courses - Cheese (with bread and other things to dip in it), salad (The Big Night Out salad is AWESOME! The honey roasted almonds are the best!), your entree (steak, chicken, pork, ravioli plus you CAN get lobster tails for an extra charge), then chocolate fondue (with rice krispie treats, strawberries and other things to dip in it). It was so filling, and was really too much food. Second visit my parents did the big night out and I just did cheese, salad and chocolate, but the waitress was sweet enough to bring me a plate with the entree too so I could snack on it as well. Of course, as with everyone else, it is pretty pricey depending on what you go there for. Their menu is available on their website, so check to see if it's in your spending range before you go. I didn't mind it since both times were special occasions and the food and the experience was wonderful, which is what we went there for. And to all of those complaining about having to \"cook your own food\" it is totally part of the experience, maybe better research a place before you go or ask to see a menu when you walk in and ask questions. Yes your entree is raw when they bring it and you stick it on the fondue sticks, dip it into a sauce or batter (if you want to) and put it on the pot of hot oil on your table. But it's pretty foolproof and they explain the cooking times, that plus using your own judgement and it's fine. I'm a horrible cook and I didn't burn anything.

The food? Mmm.. where should I start? I'm a huge fan of the cheese fondue and the multitude of dippers make it fun to mix flavors. I won't bother mentioning the salads because they're honestly just average -- no complaints -- just average. The entrees give you a variety of flavor options and all come with dipping sauces and vegetables. I've used both the oil cooking method \u00a0and the vegetable broth; both were great. I've heard good things about the coq a vin option as well, but given that it does cost more I'd say you aren't missing out by ordering one of the standards. The plus side with the oil option is you can make stuffed mushrooms and things tend to cook more quickly but I think the vegetable broth has more flavor.Moving to the dessert... the white chocolate brulee is, hands down, the best option on the menu. A warning, it is very very sweet, but I think it's delicious. Be sure to save room.Service/Atmosphere: Call ahead and make a reservation. The service has always been great and waiters/waitresses always very polite and accommodating. As for atmosphere, I know it's Melting Pot's deal to always be underground, but I'm not a fan. Personally, I need windows. Anyway, it's still a very intimate/romantic ambiance so no windows aside, I like it.Cost: If you go for the fixed price \"big night out\" I believe it's about $86 per couple (don't quote me, though. it might be a bit less.)

The lighting is quite dim and the ambiance is rather cave-like, but not unpleasant. We opted for the Pacific-themed Big Night out with a couple alterations. We started with a simple cheddar fondue which was quite good. Beer + cheddar + a little Emmenthaler swiss. It matched well with the variety of bread but not as well with the apple chunks. Next was a Caesar salad. Most Caesar's are pretty generic but this one stood out with the addition of candied pine nuts. Next was the entree which had a mix of pork, chicken, beef and ahi. The beef and ahi stood out, but like other reviewers, the idea of paying this much for food AND having to cook it myself is a bit disconcerting, especially since there is a learning curve to the cooking. Lastly was the Yin-Yang chocolate fondue which was a mix of white and dark chocolate. This was easily the standout. With a $10 premium beer thrown in, the tab was just over $100.

You know, those little thin pancakes? :p Anyway, I resolved that I would return to try them out and I did indeed do so this past week. They are tucked in a stall next to the new sushi place, along the parking lot side wall of the Market House. The facilities looked very impressive and they displayed a stunning 100 health department rating. The service was friendly and informative. Their menu offers a mix of sweet and savory crepes, ranging from buttered or cinnamon sugar to chicken. I only tried the sweet crepes, because I had a hankering for something sweet that day. I had a lemon crepe and a cinnamon sugar crepe. The lemon crepe was excellent. Perfect combination of sour lemon (squeeze in front of me), sugar, and butter mixed in between a perfectly cooked crepe. The cinnamon crepe was good, but less perfect. There was too much cinnamon and not enough sugar, so it was a bit bitter, and this crepe was a bit too crisp. However, it was an excellent meal and the prices were very reasonable. I paid around $10 for two crepes and a bottled drink. They take credit cards, btw, which is a major bonus at the Farmer's Market. Some constructive criticism... They should stop with the hawking style check out our menu calls to passers by. It puts off customers. They also shouldn't be asking for tips on checkout, since no service is provided aside from making the item, which presumably the price should cover. I gave a tip...but I view it as rude. Finally, I'd like to see some more emphasis on the sweet side, like maybe a blintze type sweet cheese item. Overall, a wonderful addition to the Farmer's Market.

The food was good, not great just good. I hear for delivery they are fantastic, however I went in. I wish I hadn't. The wallpaper was ripping everywhere, it was very dark inside and when you go in you can see stains where little kids have been touching the wall. Also when you first go in it smells musty and it is damp in there. I'll be honest I almost turned around and went home, however I got it to go, no amount of money will get me to eat in there! It took about 15 min to get the food. We got home and opened it up and our order was accurate, hot and plentiful, it was a ton of food and it was good. I had spicy chicken and my wife had sesame chicken fried rice and the legendary hot and sour soup. The soup isn't that good, it was l little on the bland side. The reason I gave them 4 stars is because the waitress was very friendly and the food was good. I mean it is cheap Chinese.
