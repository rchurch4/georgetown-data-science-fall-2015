4.5,"Superb Food, Erratic Service","We thoroughly enjoyed dining outside under an umbrella with the breezes blowing by. This is a perfect place for a leisurely - emphasis on leisurely - meal! Superb Mediterranean food, beautifully presented in more than generous quantities. NOT a good place if you are in a hurry! You can also dine inside, and there is an outside area that is...

4.5,Continued Good Food and Good Value,"We tried Cafe Ole again on a whim the other night. We decided to pass up the outdoor seating because of the dubious weather and sat inside; fortunately, the inside of the restaurant was not crowded, so we could converse in a normal voice. The service was better than usual, although it is still slightly off-putting for the wait staff...

4.5,This is a must stop!!,We had the hot sampler and Lebanese celebration....everything was bursting with flavor and served fast. It was reasonable with portions bigger than you can eat.

4.5,Love Cafe Ole'!!,"This place is so delicious. I have been there a bunch of times over the years. It is a simple setting with outside patio when weather is suitable. The owners are really hand on and almost always there. They have the best Baba Ganoosh I have had in my life and the owner makes the best homemade brownies. Sometimes they...

Their Mediterranean small plates are very varied and consistently good. Several excellent homemade soups are available every day, and the staff is very friendly. Finally, it is inexpensive, a great value for the money. Overall, it is just what you want in...

September and October are beautiful in Washington so guests can sit outside and enjoy the change of seasons. It's in a quieter part of town -- nice walkability and it's near the Tenley Town Metro.

If the weather's nice or even not so great, there's a partially covered/partially open brick patio area for dining outside. (On a crowded Friday or Saturday night, the indoor seating can feel a bit cramped.) A few favorite dishes: Tel Aviv nachos, black bean soup (great on...

4.5,Why you should eat dinner across the street from the awful post office.,"Our family has lived in DC for 14 years. We're pretty xenophobic, at least within the confines of DC -- mostly because I keep comparing DC to NYC and husband keeps comparing it to CA, both no-brainers -- but Café Olé is near our house and has great, affordable food with a FANTASTIC waiter whose name I have never learned....
