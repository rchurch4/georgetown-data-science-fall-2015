"407 53rd Ave NNashville, TN 37209",4.0,Pulled this up as a convenient place to stop on the way north. Turned out to be a good place as it was not far off the interstate and the food was fast and good! We had a meat and three and a breakfast omelet. The fried chicken was above average and all the sides were good. The sourdough roll was very good. Service was super friendly and efficient and it all added up to a solid four star rating for an old school diner!,Wendell Smith’s Restaurant,6153837114,493 reviews,2015-05-20,"Memphis, TN",/biz/wendell-smiths-restaurant-nashville-2,4.0,43,"Washington, DC",Chris M.

"407 53rd Ave NNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"I don't give out one stars often. In fact, this will only be my 34th one-star review out of 423. Aside from friendly service, there is nothing else good to write.At the recommendation of the waitress, I ordered the roast beef. I am from Texas, and in my mind, roast beef is sliced. Instead, it arrived in the form of chopped beef with brown gravy on top. It looked like vomit, and the texture was that of canned tuna. As I chewed, the meat made a squeaking noise against my teeth, just like tuna. It was disgusting.I ordered three sides. The first was macaroni and cheese. While the mac and cheese was creamy, it lacked much flavor. Garlic powder would've gone a long way to spice up the dish. The mashed potatoes were hard, but not cold, upon arrival. This indicates lack of milk or cream. The turnip greens were so sour I couldn't eat them. It's a good thing I declined extra vinegar, which was offered to me after the food arrived. The dinner roll was probably the best part of the meal.I was appalled at the portion sizes, which were meager compared to most soul food restaurants. There should've been double the sizes, even at the cheap prices. I've eaten at numerous soul food restaurants across the nation, and by far, this is definitely the restaurant with the smallest size portions. So, at this point, due to taste and portion size, I would give two stars.Add a hot chocolate, and my bill was $10.50, pre-tip. That doesn't seem bad, but I left unsatiated. In addition, the food upset my stomach (a rarity on my travels), hence the one-star rating. My stomach was so upset that instead of running errands, I had to return to the hotel for an hour.

"407 53rd Ave NNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"During a time in Nashville where all of these specialty chefs open up their boutique restaurants where they charge $15 for a burger, it's nice to see places like this still around.

"407 53rd Ave NNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"Super crowded and limited seating.We waited a good bit before we were seated.  By the crowd, I was expecting a lot, but maybe that's where I went wrong.I had the catfish and it was average at best. It wasn't horrible but it was a bit saltier than I expected and the seasoning was pretty bland. The sweet potatoes were so sweet they hurt my cheeks and I couldn't take more than one bite. The service was horrible. I might have given them another chance if the service wasn't so bad. We didn't get any refills and they switched servers on us because the first one called my husband a lady because of his long hair.

"407 53rd Ave NNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"Wendell's is a staple in my life. You cannot beat Wendell's for an early-morning breakfast. Two eggs, bacon, home fries, biscuits and gravy for about $8. You can't beat it. Lunch and dinner are good, too. I try to go on Wednesdays when they have fried chicken. If you happen to stop in on a fried green tomato day, get them! My other favorite sides are the white beans and baked squash. They are so delicious. The crowd is usually older, and the waitresses are the best. The owner is usually lurking around, and he's incredibly friendly as well.

"407 53rd Ave NNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"Drat.. was so enjoying the myth of southern food when I saw the SYSCO truck pull up and deliver case after case of generic, low quality product :(  Nothing fresh or southern about food that is essentially an agra business depot.  That got me thinking...why are the biscuits shaped so?  Turns out they are freezer Pillsbury!!  I can buy em myself, bake em at any time of day and skip the hype.Two stars only because I love the side of fresh tomatoes...never had a mushy or bad one yet..too bad that care is not applied to all the menu.

The blueberry cheesecake was great, but it would've been just as good if it didn't have any toppings on it.Overall friendly service, good food, pretty fair prices. Would've given it a four star review, but I didn't get all of my order. We didn't get there until 15 minutes from closing (I found out afterward) so it's hard to fault her too much there, but still... if you pay for food you expect to get all of it.

"407 53rd Ave NNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"As long as you are not comparing it to something else, it deserves a 4. The food is good for cheap diner food and the staff is really friendly. Seems like most of the people in here are regulars because te waitresses address some customers by name and ask about their family members.It's a cute southern spot behind a liquor store. Seems like the perfect truck stop. I didn't get BBQ on the fourth and tried to go to another BBQ spot on 54th but they were closed. So I came in here and got a pulled pork sandwich with fries and strawberry shortcake. The sandwich and fries hit the spot but I didn't like the strawberry shortcake. That's likely out of preference, I prefer them with sweet biscuits. What I got from them appeared to be soggyish cornbread when I got towards the bottom.

"407 53rd Ave NNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"Since moving to the Nations a few months ago, I've had a great time exploring my new neighborhood and trying out all the restaurants that are now within walking distance to my new house. The number one type of place I look for in a neighborhood is a great local breakfast joint. While I do sometimes miss Nashville Biscuit House in East Nashville, I believe Wendell Smith's has won my heart. I've always been a little bit nervous about trying out a restaurant that's in the back of a liquor store, but I'm sure glad I went for it. I've been there several times now and have taken some out of town friends there, and we all agree, the breakfast here rules! The bacon is cooked to perfection (something most places screw up), and when I order over medium eggs, they are actually over medium and not too runny! I usually double up on the breakfast potatoes and can rarely finish them, but they are some of the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had. They're sliced sort of like chips, but obviously way thicker, and are cooked to that perfect mix of crispy outside with a soft inside. The biscuits here are also done well. They are tiny, but super fluffy and don't have that bland flour taste that can happen with biscuits sometimes. Bacon, biscuits, and potatoes are my three favorite breakfast items and they deliver on all three. A rare feat in my book.The staff here is also extremely friendly and make you feel welcomed. I've always had great service and conversation with the wait staff and cashiers. I've never tried any of their meat and three options, but if I'm getting breakfast on the West Side and it's not Sunday, I'm definitely heading to Wendell Smith's. That's what's keeping me from a 5-star rating. I'll have to update when I try out the lunch options.",Wendell Smith’s Restaurant,6153837114,23 reviews,2013-07-22,"Nashville, TN",/biz/wendell-smiths-restaurant-nashville-2,4.0,43,"Washington, DC",Ryan S.

It is busy during the week at lunch, but you can still be seated and served quickly. This is not a 'posh' place, so if you are a snob, this is not for you. If you only want gourmet food, this is not for you. But if you really need some delicious home-style food, come here at least once a week, like I do. I have tried most dishes, and am always satisfied. Fried green tomatoes every other Monday. Wonderful sides--sometimes I just get a vegetable plate.

It was very difficult not to eavesdrop into the neighboring conversations. You seat yourself in a variety of booths and tables neatly packed into a space barely able to accommodate them.

"407 53rd Ave NNashville, TN 37209",4.0,Pretty good place for the Meat & Three category. The atmosphere is very laid back and has the local feeling that everybody knows everyone and their families. It's just what you expect from a Meat & Three dining experience. The fried catfish on Fridays is some of the best I've ever had.

"407 53rd Ave NNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"Wendell's is one of my favorite places to stop by and have a better than home cooked meal  on the run. They have fast service unless you go during the lunch rush where sometimes people may have to even wait for a seat because the place is still so small. The tables are close together with mostly booth seating which I like. The decor is definitely vintage retro 1950's and you can count on it being the same week by week and year by year.          The menus are handwritten and you can expect  the same menu on the same day next week. That is a plus in my opinion in case I am craving something in particular. The vegetables are like your grandma cooked them so if you are on a heart healthy diet this might not be the place for you; but if you want fried chicken, cat fish, liver and onions, green beans, turnip greens, cream potatoes,fresh squash , flat cornbread or  cornbread muffins dished up in large portions  with fudge pie and coffee for dessert  then this is your kind of eating. You just have to call ahead to ask if your craving is on the menu today! They will also make you a great ""to go"" take out plate to take to a sick friend or to have for a nice picnic in the park.             This is a family run business with hard working waitresses who get to know their customers so well they welcome  them with familiar greetings  and many if not MOST all the patrons are regulars. The cozy atmosphere and down home cooking make it  feel like a  delightful blast from the past  of  familiar Southern hospitality and down home cooking at its BEST.

"501 Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",5.0,"Lately I've been searching for a good butcher shop. Nothing fancy, just something better than the Kroger meat department. When I discovered that a small barbecue venture known as The Gambling Stick operates out of east Nashville's Porter Road Butcher on Saturdays, I had no choice but to check things out.The Gambling Stick is a pretty simple operation: smoker, table, coolers. What more do you need? I'd love to see these guys get their own brick-and-mortar shop, but for now their beach canopy setup at Porter Road Butcher works just fine. It's a pretty symbiotic relationship anyway, since these guys work at and get their meat from PRB. The butcher shop has some picnic tables on their patio, which works great for lunch. The smell of delicious smoke was almost too much to handle. I had to get my hands (and lips) on some barbecue ASAP!Each week The Gambling Stick has a slightly different menu. Today's special Barbecue Plate came with two meats, a summer vegetable salad, baked beans, cornbread, and sauce. Considering my third option was pulled pork, the choice of two meats was a no-brainer: brisket and pigsket (pork brisket). The pork brisket isn't something I've encountered before, so I was especially intrigued.Their summer salad had quite the assortment of julienned veggies: zucchini, squash, green beans, red onion, bell pepper, and probably some other stuff. The light, crisp vegetables were a good pairing with the heavy meat. I also really enjoyed the baked beans, which had only a slight sweetness to them and were more savory than typical baked beans. The cornbread came straight from a cast iron skillet. Mmmmmmm. Sweet, buttery, fantastic.For a native Texan, brisket was a welcome sight in a land of pulled pork. I asked for mine extra fatty, just to be sure. The crust was black as night, with a deep red smoke ring beneath. It was extremely tender, and each bite was packed with smoke and their tasty rub. I can easily say that this was some of the best brisket I've had in Nashville so far.Even though I knew this pigsket was likely coming from the lower portion of the pig's shoulder, I still wasn't entirely sure what to expect. Overall, it tasted similar to a pork loin, except way better and much more tender. No surprise, the pigsket had a great smoke level. The combination of crisp bark and well-rendered fat was awesome. This might be my new favorite cut of pork.The meat was so good on its own that I completely forgot to try the sauce, which is exactly the way it should be. Despite the 25-minute drive, I will definitely be back.",The Gambling Stick,5026498894,541 reviews,2014-08-02,"Nashville, TN",/biz/the-gambling-stick-nashville,5.0,6,"Washington, DC",Jared K.

"501 Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",5.0,"How long have I been missing out on this place?  First time there was today and it was transcendentally good--possibly the best smoked pork (I had the ""pigsket"") I've ever had.  I didn't even use/need the sauce. Be warned that they have odd hours if you're counting on them to be open later in the evening and if you are jonesing for some Q on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday you're out of luck entirely.  Also, if you go on Thursday (as I did today) you won't be able to get the meats that take longer to cook  (beef brisket and pulled pork).  That was ok however because the pig ""brisket"" was other-wordly. This is solid BBQ and worth leaving work early for.UPDATE: ok, in the interests of serving the Yelp community, I seem to have managed to eat at the Gambling Stick on four (!!!) separate occasions last week.  Each time the food was exceptional with the pigsket, the pulled pork and beef brisket all being equally superb. I cannot really say which one I like ""the best"" but if you've never had *good* beef brisket you should try that at least one time as the balance between the beef flavor and smoke was just perfect.  I tend to not get too excited about side but I will say that the collard greens are really good and are not wilted to the point that they have no texture of their own.  The BBQ beans were also great and contained some nice hunks of smoked pork as well.  Oh, and the cornbread is exactly what cornbread should be, savory (not sweet) and moist.  They also seem to have a lot of ""occasional"" offerings (ribs, sloppy joes, peach cobblers) that look like they are only available in limited supply and only while they last.  Only criticism I have is that when they are busy they might sometimes miss putting an item in your order, so definitely check to see if you are missing anything.  I cannot recommend this place highly enough.  If you appreciate good BBQ, just go.",The Gambling Stick,5026498894,52 reviews,2015-05-21,"Nashville, TN",/biz/the-gambling-stick-nashville,5.0,6,"Washington, DC",David R.

I have tried and liked them all.They serve rice with most orders and it is soooo gooood. Also a kabob of vegetables that I freaking love.

"48 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.5,"There is nothing particularly wrong with this place.  I had a perfectly decent meal.  That said, maybe my expectations were set a little too high by the reviews on here, but it just wasn't a 4 or 5 star experience for me.  The food was good but not great.  We started with the appetizer sampler.  The grape leaves appetizer was cold.  Not like room temp or fresh but very very cold.  Maybe that's how it was supposed to be, but I thoughtit would have tasted better a little closer to room temp.  They were also oilier than similar appetizers that I've had at Greek or Mediterranean restaurants, but that didn't bother me.  The feta wrapped in filo was wonderful, (especially with the rose jam) but how would one screw that up?  The hummus was OK, nothing special, and most of our pita was burned.  Dinner (chicken shish kabob for me, turkish gyros for the man) was fine but didn't blow my mind.  My veggie kabob was a little overcooked, his was undercooked and neither were seasoned.  Finally, for the amount of food (and for its location), it just seemed a little overpriced.  In conclusion, I'd go back.  It certainly was A-OK, as the 3 stars indicate.  But nothing blew me away and there are a lot of other places on my ""to try"" list that I'd probably go to first.",Anatolia Turkish Restaurant,6153561556,417 reviews,2014-05-16,"Nashville, TN",/biz/anatolia-turkish-restaurant-nashville,3.0,143,"Washington, DC",Cassie S.

Finally, we had the kunefe.  I have never had anything like it and ordered it based upon Yelp reviews I was not disappointed. My wife and I were stuffed after the appetizer and kabob and asked for the dessert to go. Our waiter insisted that we try it warm. We listened and it came out on a plate with an inlaid pan. It looked quite pretty and tasted better than it looks. I can't explain the taste, but the pastry combined with the cheese and syrup was the perfect end to a perfect meal. All of the portions were sizable and we took half of the dessert home with us. I also cannot say enough about the service. We came in around 8 PM after driving all day. We were dressed casually (wife in sundress and me in shorts and T-shirt).  Other people in the restaurant were dressed more upscale, but we were not treated any differently.  Our waiter was extremely nice and helpful--helping us navigate an unfamiliar menu.

"48 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.5,"Road-tripping, I have Yelp to thank for landing in a Turkish Restaurant in Nashville--not exactly what we were planning.  Living in New York, I would never pick a restaurant in a strip mall, because, perhaps with some suburban prejudice, I assume all food in a mall or strip mall is watered down and commercial garbage.  Hopefully I've learned my lesson because Anatolia is outstanding in every way.Started with the sampler, including the best grape leaves I've ever had. I don't usually like them but these were unique, much more sophisticated flavors than I've ever had. The Hummus was light, creamy, and tangy, but the real stars were the filo dough/cheese thingies you dip in a rose petal and cherry sauce. I could have eaten many more of them, and my girlfriend and I thought of a friend of ours who would have gorged himself! For dinner I had a spinach stuffed chicken breast and got both sauce options, as suggested by our excellent waitress. The coconut sauce was forgettable but the tomato was among my favorite from any cuisine. It was bright and tangy with just enough sweetness, and the basil came through in a refreshingly subtle way. Regarding the rice pilaf, my girlfriend said, ""I shoveled a fork into my mouth before I swallowed the last bite. I almost choked."" Some greedy eating, which only happens with food you love.We finished the meal with a couple of Turkish coffees, and, you guessed it, the best I've ever had. As a testament to her love for me, my girl pushed her coffee my way, and said, ""Finish it. You obviously enjoyed yourself.""The service was excellent on all fronts. Ayla, our waitress, was attentive but not overly so, which I find is sort of the southern style. I kind of prefer to have my food put down, maybe one follow up, then to be left alone while the server can be reached visually if anything comes up, and that was Ayla.

"48 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.5,"Huge fan of this place!  It's not the sort you would drive by and think, ""Wow, I have to try that Turkish restaurant in the strip mall.""  However, if you do, you'll be pleasantly surprised.The atmosphere is much better on the inside than the exterior.  It's not the swankiest restaurant around, but it's definitely passable.The food is outstanding.  This is a great place to come for dinner, and recount the day's events over food that is reasonably healthy, with a glass of red wine.  There are a number of great vegetarian dishes on the menu which I usually gravitate towards--even though I am not actually vegetarian.  Hummus is delicious, but the haydari is something I can't live without.  My husband and I usually order an appetizer with half of each, and it's gone in 60 seconds.  There's a ravioli dish on the menu, and every time I order it, the server cautions me that patrons either love it or hate it.  I always smile and say I know...but you can safely place me in the ravioli-lover camp.  I can see why people who order it (thinking it's standard ravioli fare) would be disappointed, because it's nothing like it.  It comes in small bite-sized doses of ground lamb in pasta, with a thick tangy yogurt sauce laced with butter and mint.  But if you're in the mood for something a little more uncharted, it's a total win.  Still, you may want to try the haydari as an appetizer to test out your response to the yogurt, before committing to the entree.The ravioli is good, but my favorite dish is probably the Turkish stew (either with lamb or the vegetarian option), which comes in a Very Hot bowl.  You're probably going to want to let it cool off a bit, but the vegetables have always been cooked to perfection, every time I have ordered it--and that's at least three dozen times.  The veggie sampler is a veggie stuffed eggplant with a stuffed artichoke on the side.  This is the entree that may inspire me to write a pine-nut love rhapsody at some point.  The rice pilaf is delicious dipped in the yogurt sauce accompaniments.  And I would be remiss if I didn't mention the shrimp saute.  I've never been able to tear myself away from the other options to order it myself, but I always steal some of my husband's and it really is all that.  He also enjoys the fish specials (salmon and halibut).Hot Turkish tea is good but Turkish coffee will always have my heart.  And their baklava.  Oh, baklava...just take my advice, save room for dessert.Finally, I really love the servers.  They are just wonderful, friendly and attentive.  All around, a great restaurant!  Probably just as well (for me) that it isn't as high profile as some of the trendier spots, because I love being able to always get a table for some of the best food in Nashville!",Anatolia Turkish Restaurant,6153561556,20 reviews,2012-05-28,"Nashville, TN",/biz/anatolia-turkish-restaurant-nashville,5.0,143,"Washington, DC",Anne D.
"48 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.5,"Anatolia is one of my favorite places to eat and I've been there a number of times now. The staff is always super friendly and graciously answered my dining companion's questions. Anatolia is part of a strip mall, but don't let that fool you. The inside is nice enough for a Saturday date yet casual enough for a Tuesday night after work when you don't feel like cooking. It would be a killer stand alone restaurant, but it's good as is too. Anyway, here's what I recommend:Stuffed GrapeleavesHaydariHummusIskender Kabob (I order this every time)Grilled Veggies (seriously, omg)Kunefe (order ahead of time!)If I tried more items on the menu, I would probably like those too but I always seem to order the same thing over and over. Portions: I usually have enough left over for lunch the next day. Consistency: Not too bad, but my rice was a little chilly the last time I visited. The Haydari seemed slightly different than last time too, but still delicious. Wine: They serve it. But, there's a reason Turkey isn't known for their wines. They definitely have other wines too. Prices: A little pricey, so I don't make it here as often as I want to. Service: Top notch. Very accommodating. I've rarely waited for a table.Comparisons: Compared to other Turkish restaurants in TN, this one is probably my favorite, although each has their strengths.

"48 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.5,"I enjoyed the appetizer sampler, particularly the hummus and stuffed grape leaves. The lamb chops were good and the lamb shish kabob was good.I ordered the kunefe dessert with my meal because it takes 20 minutes to prepare.

Well after we finished our meal he finally returned to take our plates and ask if we wanted dessert. We asked about kunefe, and got it approximately 30 minutes later.The atmosphere on a weekend evening was nice.

"48 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.5,"While Anatolia is in an area that we frequent, this was my first visit to the restaurant. What a great visit it was! I had the Veggie Sampler, which was an eggplant (stuffed with onions, pine nuts, tomatoes and parsleys), an artichoke (stuffed with pine nuts, rice and currants), a skewer of grilled vegetables and a side of rice. While the stuffed eggplant and artichoke were good, the skewer of grilled vegetables was my favorite of the three. The food overall was very flavorful. I also tried two of the hot teas on the menu: the Turkish Hot Apple Tea and the Rosehip Tea. I highly recommend trying the Rosehip tea. Both were served very hot. Finally, the best part was the dessert. Upon recommendation from a friend, we tried the Kunafeh, which is a cheese center and a whispy crispy top and bottom (similar to shredded wheat). At first I thought it would be overly sweet, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was just the right amount of sweet. It's good to order this dessert when you order your main course because it takes about 20 minutes to be made. The service was superb. The server must have known we were new to the restaurant, because he was patient and helpful by describing the menu items when we asked and telling me his opinions of the tea. He was super nice to us from the beginning to the end, despite the restaurant getting very busy toward the end of our meal.

Properly seasoned, correct texture of the veggies and chicken, all around winner!We also got the appetizer platter to try a variety of what they offer. Stuffed grape leaves were good. Hummus was above average, but nothing that blew your socks off. The fried filo dough with rose petal jam was sneaky good. My complaint is that I felt like it was overpriced. Maybe it's inflation, maybe it's just poorly priced. But the food bill alone was $43, and many of their offerings are served in a similar Mediterranean way at many restaurants in town for about 25% less.

A little larger than those that I encountered in Turkey but very, very good. The bread is great and the rice is also really good. My husband had the gyro platter and he raved about it as well. We split a nice bottle of white Turkish wine that paired nicely with our food. Yes, the decor could be better but if the food is good I could care less.

"48 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.5,"The Saturday following Thanksgiving.  Since I was away from home for the holiday, I didn't have any turkey leftovers.  So I asked myself: ""where does one go for leftover turkey?""  I answered myself: ""Why, Turkey, of course."" Since a flight to Turkey was out of my lunch budget, I opted for the Anatolia Turkish Restaurant, on Nashville's west side.  After driving over the hills and through the woods (well, I assume woods once stood in the area, now it's mostly Interstate) I began my Turkey hunt.  It was truly a hunt, since this restaurant is back from the road, hidden behind Calhoun's Pub.  My GPS also indicated that they were on the left hand (south) side of the road, and they were not.  That's what I get for putting my GPS on the British voice setting.  Always doing things on the wrong side of the road.The restaurant itself looks like it could of been selling clothes a week earlier.  The walls have the grooves to hang shelves or slanted racks.  Some of the shelving even held wine bottles, which was a nice touch for a place with no concept of ambiance.I seldom pass on a shot at a decent bottle of wine, and their wine list was an actual list, which is a good sign.  But the menu also had 2 hot teas available.  Noting that tea is a Turkish custom, and the hot apple tea would fill my 'thanksgiving leftover apple pie' need, I opted for the hot beverage.If you like hot cider, you'll like the hot apple tea.  Not very tea like, but quite delicious.  They serve it in a funny little glass, and keep it refilled.  I had like 3 or 4 glasses of the stuff.  It was good.The bread came out.  Now to get a review on the bread, well, it must be really good, or suck awfully bad.  This is the former.  Hot, toasty yet thick enough to still be bread, and tasty - with or without the flavored olive oil for dipping.The appetizers (5 stuffed grape leaves), were also quite flavorful.  They were cold, and that surprised the both of us.  I'm not sure if that's normal, but it tasted like it was right.  Like a salad in the shape of a egg roll.The Lamb came with a fair amount of spice.  Not hot spice, but a powerful spice that may wreak havoc if you have heartburn issues.  Not familiar enough with Turkish spices I couldn't tell what they were, but it pleased my palate.When they brought the lunch, we went ahead and ordered the Kunefe (they suggest a 20 minute lead time).  Of course by the time I finished my meal (and make no mistake, I couldn't stop eating) I was sorry we ordered even more food.  My sorrow would have to get buried in a plate of wheat and thin filo dough covered cheese.  The desert was clearly meant for 4, but there were only 2 of us.  We ate the whole thing.Nothing like being stuffed on turkey, unless it's not turkey.  And it wasn't.  It was lamb. The lamb might have been from Turkey, so I guess that counts. Did you know they don't have turkeys in Turkey?  Now I have to drive to Sandwich, New Hampshire to see if they have sandwiches there.  Maybe a turkey sandwich.  I digress...As a bonus, we came here armed with a coupon from the ""Entertainment"" book, which saved us $10.  After taking the $10 off the bill, the waiter gave us the coupon back, to use on our next visit.  And we will use it again.",Anatolia Turkish Restaurant,6153561556,63 reviews,2010-11-30,"Nashville, TN",/biz/anatolia-turkish-restaurant-nashville,5.0,143,"Washington, DC",M.

"48 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.5,"I came for lunch with a couple of friends today and ordered a gyro sandwich (reasonably priced at less than $7 with an accompanying side of fries).The waiter kindly offered alternatives to the fries, including a salad.Waiter: ""Would you like everything on the salad?""Me: ""What's everything?""Waiter: ""Tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, etc.""Me: ""Oh, sure.""(Well, you have to ask when someone says 'everything'. Otherwise you might inadvertently end up with sheep's tongue or something on your salad. Not that there's anything wrong with that, if you're into sheep's tongue.)Anyway, the gyro was good, the salad was small and *very* lightly dressed, but it tasted fresh. My dining companions seemed to like their food (another gyro and a shrimp kebab plate).Incidentally, when my gyro arrived, it still came with fries, so I ended up with both fries and salad, but I think that was a small oversight on the kitchen's part. Having sampled both, I would encourage you to go with the salad. The fries are fine, but unremarkable. The salad is better and healthier for you.Service and ambiance are both nice. Restroom was clean. I like the bowl of chocolate mints available on the host stand.Tip - If you're in the mood for a different sort of beverage, try the sour cherry juice.The only low note?

"48 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.5,"I tried Anatolia based on the yelp reviews and I am VERY glad that I did! The staff is extremely friendly, and the atmosphere is very welcoming and relaxed--sort of felt like a casual dinner party at a friend's house. The groups of diners were pretty diverse-- a large, multi-generational family, a group of dressed up elderly folks, and couples on dates. Despite what you might think, it worked to have everyone all together in one big room; in fact, I think enhanced, rather than detracted from my dining experience. As for food, we started with falafel and hummus. The falafel had a bit of a kick, which I really liked. It's hard to mess up hummus and pita bread. I had the chicken kabobs and my dining partner had the lamb kabobs. Both were excellent - the meat was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Very juicy and tasty. I think someone else said you can tell all the ingredients are fresh and I would have to agree.The dinner was flawless - I will definitely be back!",Anatolia Turkish Restaurant,6153561556,19 reviews,2010-05-24,"Richmond, VA",/biz/anatolia-turkish-restaurant-nashville,4.0,143,"Washington, DC",Dessa T.

"48 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.5,"Anatolia is the best Turkish restaurants in Nashville. How do I know? Well, I am Turkish and I have been to all Turkish restaurants. I go there quite often and find the atmosphere to be pretty good. The food is also very good. I really like the Turkish meatballs and mixed grill plate. The appetizers are also very good. The sample appetizer plate is very good. Now, if you go there you must try the Kunefe desert, they make it very good. You have to order this in advance though becuase the prep takes some time.

"48 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.5,"I first went to Anatolia with a group from work. I had never been even though I don't live very far away. I mainly followed my coworkers'  suggestions on what to get, and I was not disappointed. I've since taken friends and relatives to this unassuming place in the Lion's Head strip mall off of White Bridge Rd., and they have loved it as well.Definitely start with the sampler appetizer platter. Depending on how many people you are dining with, you may be full after polishing off this huge plate which includes delicious dolmas, some fried phyllo dough stuffed with feta, and really fresh hummus with a nice tang of fresh lemon. It's definitely worth it, though. You can always take your entree home in a doggie bag. I wasn't very familiar with Turkish food and still wouldn't claim to be an expert, but the Iskender Kabobs are awesome. They have a great tomato sauce and are definitely worth a try. I've also had a couple of chicken dishes -- the chicken stew and spinach stuffed chicken -- which were worth it as well.I wouldn't be intimated by this place if you've never had Turkish food or aren't sure what kind of food you might get.

Anatolia is a lovely gem of a restaurant located in an unassuming strip mall next to the White Bridge Target. The interior is lovely (oriental rugs don the walls!), and the service is always gracious. You really can't go wrong with anything you order, but my favorites are the Anatolia sampler platter (particularly their filo roll, which is basically deep-fried, salty cheese in a pastry), the chicken stew (reminds me of a high-fallutin' chicken pot pie), and the iskender kabob (kabob meat topped with a savory tomato sauce).

"48 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.5,"Very, very tasty food here.  This place is tucked back in a strip mall, so it is very unassuming, but the food is first rate.  They have some delicious vegetarian menu items, like their vegetable Guvec which is a Turkish veggie stew with too many types of veggies to list! ( eggplant, zucchini, green beans, bell peppers...).  But their specialties are their their lamb dishes and their kebabs. They really know how to grill the lamb, it was  full of flavor.   My mouth is watering just remembering this...I went to Anatolia for a birthday party with friends and got to taste a lot of the dishes,  they also let us bring in our own wine.  We had a big table of people and spent most of the evening in the restaurant.  Anatolia is small and intimate; the decor is modest but classically 'nice.'  We all felt really relaxed and had a great evening.  Oh, and the desert, it was classic Turkish Baklava and Turkish 'cup o mud' coffee, which both made a great finish to a good long meal.

I wanted every inch of that cheese stick covered in rose jam and then even more! Very sad when the jam was gone. Absolutely delectable! I also ordered the apple tea which was a great end to lunch.

The food is high quality, seasoned perfectly, and uniformly delicious. I haven't tried anything here that I haven't loved.

It's the little things that make this a great restaurant though - the delicious skewer of grilled veggies that come with the gyros, the grilled pita bread that comes with the hummus, the tasty and usually warm wheat bread served with olive oil & spices to start your meal. These little touches move it from just being a good restaurant to being great. In addition, if you eat in, the service is always excellent. The waitstaff are knowledgeable and efficient and are there when you need them, but don't disrupt your meal otherwise. If you really want a treat, order the kunefe (for dessert) when you order your entrees. It's big enough to split between several people, but a delicious ending to the meal.

"48 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.5,"Anatolia may be the best restaurant I've visited in Nashville.  The food was simply outstanding.  And Turkish?  In a strip mall?  It doesn't get any more funky than this.Walking in I felt like I re-entered the 1980s.  The Mediterranean-ish theme put me back more than 20 years.  I'm surprised I wasn't given a bottle of Aqua Net and some Reebok pumps upon entry.  I guess that's my way of saying you won't be blown away by ambiance here but it's the food that really shines.  For starters they bring you some bread with a small bowl of spices to which you add as much olive oil as you please. We ordered the Haydari to start, a thick homemade yogurt with chopped walnuts, garlic, carrots and dried mint folded in and served with triangle slices of toasted pita bread.  I'm not lying when I say this was one of the best things I've ever eaten.  I could eat that everyday, it was delicious.  It was so good that once the pita bread was gone, I began dipping the other bread in and eating that.  Had we run out of bread, I may have just dipped my finger in or part of my shoe or anything else within reach.  I think you get the point.  Seriously...order this.For dinner I went with the Turkish gyros served with cucumber sauce, rice and grilled vegetables.  The vegetables were charred and had that wonderful smoke flavor to them that reminds you of summer.  My only complaint is that I wish there was less meat and more vegetables.  But if I were honest, I would say that you can do better in selecting a different entree.  It's not that I didn't like it, I just know there are better options on the menu.  And after mowing through the Haydari in record time, my expectations rose.Will I be back?  Hell yes.  That Haydari is something I may almost fly to Nashville to order.  I love this place.",Anatolia Turkish Restaurant,6153561556,327 reviews,2011-04-28,"Chicago, IL",/biz/anatolia-turkish-restaurant-nashville,5.0,143,"Washington, DC",Dusty K.

"48 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.5,Went here for dinner on a Sunday night.  We were really impressed.  The wait staff was attentive and pleasant.  The homemade bread was fresh and warm and tasted fantastic with the olive oil & spices dip.  I ordered the roasted lamb and my husband got the mixed grill plate.  The portions were generous and tasty.  The roasted lamb was particularly good and very authentic.  We were so full we didn't get dessert!,Anatolia Turkish Restaurant,6153561556,18 reviews,2010-09-07,"Sugar Land, TX",/biz/anatolia-turkish-restaurant-nashville,5.0,143,"Washington, DC",Carla C.
"48 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.5,"Not busy on a Thursday night. Being a slow night, we had excellent service. I hear that this place can get pretty slow when crowded, but we did not have that problem at all. The Turkish Apple Tea was great and every time I finished a cup, they were right there refilling it. My friend and I had the Mixed Grill and the Veggie Sampler. It was a nice way to sample a lot of different things. I was very pleased. The kabobs are excellent. The vegetables are nicely seasoned, but a little oily from the grill. The rice pilaf was not amazing, but still quite good. The yogurt dip was very flavorful. Overall, it is a surprisingly authentic Turkish experience. The brothers who own this place wanted to give a sampling of what people would actually eat in their homes in Turkey, rather than what a Turkish restaurant would offer. While the dcor is a little sparse, I highly recommend this restaurant. p.s. Turkish is very similar to Greek and other Mediterranean cuisine. Expect yogurt sauces, garlic, mint, lamb, thinly layered pastry dough, and cheeses.  p.p.s This place has a great selection of vegetarian-friendly options.",Anatolia Turkish Restaurant,6153561556,63 reviews,2008-05-28,"Franklin, TN",/biz/anatolia-turkish-restaurant-nashville,4.0,143,"Washington, DC",Matthew S.
"48 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.5,"Just moved from Nashville to TX, and this is one of the few restaurants that I will miss. Frankly, there just aren't many good, reasonably priced restaurants in Nashville. Many places are over-priced or mediocre, catering to the country music tourists. There are also lots of large, generic chain restaurants. This place is unique, tasty, and very reasonably priced.  Don't let the strip mall exterior fool you! (The inside is actually very comfortable.) I wanted to write a positive review as my thanks for all the delicious meals I ate there over the years. We ate here on many occasions, and we never had a bad meal or bad service. Honestly, I can't think of a negative comment. The sampler platter is a great appetizer and the Turkish pizza is yummy.

I had called ahead to ask about bringing our six year old child and they were beyond hospitable.  I think that they gave us their head of the house,  someone extraordinarily good with children.  He made what might otherwise have been a somewhat difficult dinner with a child who does not like to sit down long enough to eat  something extraordinary.  I had  their grilled wild caught salmon, served with roasted tomatoes.  It was  tender and moist and very nice, although, aside from the way the tomatoes were cooked, would not have known what made it Turkish.  The next time we go I think I will have their sampler platter- or ask what the regulars are eating.  Delightful place, great food, outstanding service.  I we lived in Nashville, I would eat there regularly, as I think a lot of fortunate Turkish people do!",Anatolia Turkish Restaurant,6153561556,3 reviews,2013-09-20,"Clarksville, TN",/biz/anatolia-turkish-restaurant-nashville,5.0,143,"Washington, DC",Miyo K.

"48 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.5,"Anatolia was my first and only foray into Turkish food, and I certainly wasn't disappointed!  My husband and I passed this restaurant for months on our way to our favorite haunt, Sonobana, and finally decided to try it out.  I love Greek food, and haven't been able to find an authentic Greek restaurant that I loved, so I figured Turkish would be close enough.  I was both right and wrong.  Anatolia definitely squelched that craving of mine, but I discovered so much more in the process.  Anatolia is my new comfort food!  Whenever I'm feeling less than my best, my husband knows to pick up the chicken stew and sigara boregi on his way home.  The latter is thin fillo dough rolled with feta and parsley and served with a rose petal jam.  Technically, it is an appetizer, but I love the salty sweet roll-ups as dessert.  Anatolia is the kind of restaurant I love to eat in and love to review.  They aren't trying to gussy up Turkish flavors in any way or fuse them with something else.  They make real rustic food using the real rustic flavors of Turkey, and I wouldn't have it any other way.",Anatolia Turkish Restaurant,6153561556,7 reviews,2012-01-11,"Nashville, TN",/biz/anatolia-turkish-restaurant-nashville,4.0,143,"Washington, DC",Jamie P.

I'm not a big fan of lamb, so I can't really comment on that, however, I did partake in the appetizer sampler, which was a good way to start a meal. I'm a sucker for good tzatziki especially when it's smothering a tasty piece of well-seasoned meat, and Anatolia definitely gave me the package. Their rice and tea was also quite good.

"7657 Hwy 70 SNashville, TN 37221",4.5,"This is a very good place with extremely good service.  First of all this is located inside a pretty large strip mall, so there is plenty of parking.  However, it's obscured from the highway due to a bank and a restaurant in the way, so it is somewhat hidden.  They also don't seem to have a website to check out the menu (which I like to do before going to a place) but this one was worth the blind plunge. The food here is pretty much what you expect from a sandwich shop, I ended up getting the ham and cheese, with roasted potatoes on the side.  I've only been here once (I just saw it today), so that has been the only thing I've tried from here.  It was tasty, on a bun with ample amounts of cheese and sauce.  The potatoes were tasty as well, and would definitely order them again.  It looks like a family owned business so it doesn't have the glitz and glamor of big food chains, but the food is good and the prices are definitely good.  Furthermore, I think the service is impeccable.  Probably one of the best services I've seen from a fast food shop, as the person (who I believe was the owner) was very helpful, courteous, and friendly.   They weren't very busy, which I believe is mainly due to the location being somewhat hidden from the highway, but I think this is a very good place to check out.  I would recommend this place to everyone, for the food, the price, and definitely the friendliness.",3rd Coast,6155307475,50 reviews,2014-04-30,"Nashville, TN",/biz/3rd-coast-nashville,5.0,32,"Washington, DC",Alvin P.
"7657 Hwy 70 SNashville, TN 37221",4.5,"This is an update from my previous review, in which I gave 3rd Coast four stars. This place deserves a better rating than that. I've probably been here seven or eight times at this point, and each time has been a good experience. It's a small, family-owned and operated place. The interior isn't very impressive, but then again I've never been impressed by a sandwich shop's interior. Each time I've gone, the owner has been the only one working (well, sometimes his daughter is there helping), and he's a really nice guy who makes great food and takes pride in what he does.As other reviewers pointed out, it's important to consider the alternatives in this area. 3rd Coast, for the price, puts these places to shame. Sure, it's not as quick or convenient as those places, but the quality of the food and the service blow the competition out of the water.  I'd much rather support this kind of place instead of yet another crappy chain. With only one person working, there can be a bit of a wait sometimes. Again, if you want truly fast food, this is not the place for you. If you don't mind a little extra wait for a better product, you won't be disappointed. If you have to wait a little longer than usual, Frank will gladly give you a free drink or maybe even a cookie. He's a great guy. I came in once when my wife was sick and mentioned it to Frank, and he quickly put together a ""get well soon"" container of cookies for her. No charge.The sandwiches are great, and so are the prices. Some sandwiches, however, are better than others. I'm partial to the roast beef on the pretzel roll. I love the mac and cheese. You really can't go wrong here. The meat is fresh and cut thick. The ingredient combinations are tasty and creative. I have enjoyed everything I have ordered.

That is a plus.The menu is small. It has up to 15+ items but hey that can be good sometimes.As others say, this looks like any build your own sandwhich place at first.The price on everything is low/cheap which is under $7 (including taxes) Everything is fresh made which is another plus.You can chose to make a sandwhich however you like or just chose one from the menu.I got the broiled Shrimp sandwhich.I was surprized to see how perfectly cooked the shrimp looked. The taste is another story. It left a yummy taste in my mouth that I could remember. Just for that alone, I would come back for.In addition the that, the owner gave me and my friend a side cup of beans/corn with cream for free!He wanted us to eat the food first while it was still hot and fresh before we paid.Sure it took like almost 10 mins to make the both of our sandwhiches but it was extremely worth it.I'd like it if he added Fish. The menu says it could be changed from time to time.You have choices of Chicken, Roast beef, Turkey, or Shrimp sandwhiches.I want to try the alternative Mac and Cheese platter.Everything is homemade and fresh.I can tell its basically healthy food.At first look of the sandwhich, it seems like you could easily make it at home yourself. That maybe true but it's not the food itself that makes it good, it's also the person that preps/cooks it. That's something that you won't have at home (unless you are a good cook). This means the owner is passionate about making the sandwhich which really makes it good.I rather go here than some fast food place which untrusting people who handles the food in nasty ways.If you want a quickish good food to eat, come here.Help spead the word, 3rd Coast deserves it.",3rd Coast,6155307475,1 review,2015-02-08,"Nashville, TN",/biz/3rd-coast-nashville,5.0,32,"Washington, DC",ZiShu G.

"7657 Hwy 70 SNashville, TN 37221",4.5,"I didn't want to go with one star because that gives an ""ewww"" impression, but I'd say 1.5 - 2.0 is a fair evaluation. After reading the previous reviews I was excited to try out this place. I do like to support local businesses and small business owners. However, what I got was just ""meh."" I mean, it wasn't bad. It just was not anything I couldn't make at home in about 10 minutes (minus the roasting time of the turkey and simmering time of the black beans.) Someone at work wanted to try the place so i looked over the reviews here and just told my coworker to grab me a Cajun Chicken sandwich and some sort of healthy side.When my coworker returned I was told that she decided not to get anything but had picked up a Cajun Turkey Sandwich for me and a side of black beans and corn. Since I'm probably the least picky person on earth when it comes to food I was fine with the substitution of turkey instead of chicken.When I opened the to-go container I was honestly shocked. From the reviews I read I was expecting a juicy, tasty sandwich with scratch made condiments and a flavorful mix of black beans and corn.  However, what I got was simply boiled black beans and corn. No seasoning at all and the beans could have been canned. The sandwich was just a white sesame seed bun with two pieces of iceberg lettuce, one tomato slice, two pickles, and a green onion cut in half and laid in two sticks across the turkey meat. The only thing that came close to making this ""Cajun turkey"" was a splash of Louisiana hot sauce (at least that's what it seemed to be.) There was very little seasoning on the turkey as well. It seemed as though maybe it was kissed with very little salt and pepper and oven roasted. There was no mayo or mustard or condiment of ANY kind on the sandwich except for the splash of hot sauce.The turkey meat was juicy and properly roasted but that was about the only highlight of the entire meal.  Maybe it was an off day. Maybe other menu items are better. However, based of what I received today, the only reason I would go back is because the meat seemed to be from a turkey breast that was actually roasted in house which puts Split Bread ahead of Wendy's, Hardee's, Sonic, etc (the other fast food places in the area) but unfortunately the service is not fast due to no employees and very few cooking appliances and the rest of the meal was just completely forgettable.I really wanted this to be a place I could get behind and enjoy on days I don't bring lunch to work. Sadly, I will not be back.  The prices are not bad and the food does seem to be fresh but it's nothing special and could be made at home without any trouble. When I decide to order food from a restaurant, I want it to be something I don't or can't make at home.I wish the nice owner lots of luck but I feel if he plans to be successful he needs to create more memorable dishes and figure out how to get the proper equipment and staff to in order to operate a restaurant efficiently and profitably.",3rd Coast,6155307475,11 reviews,2014-03-12,"Nashville, TN",/biz/3rd-coast-nashville,2.0,32,"Washington, DC",Brian N.

I got the special (turkey, pepperoni, spinach and cheese) it was very good with their homemade dressing and a side of corn&beans and roasted potatoes. The weekly special w/ one side was $5. Very reasonably priced. Their meat are not shaved cold cuts but nice carved slices, chicken you get a full chicken breast.When we were there only the owner was working.  He got our orders and 5 lunch plates made within 20 min. As more people find out how good it is they will need to get more employees on hand to keep up with the demand. While we were there they were not very busy so we enjoyed talking with the owner Frank.

"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"My husband and I went here for our anniversary earlier in the week wanting to support a local business. Ellendale's is marketed as an up-scale place and, for the occasion, we figured we'd splurge. My formula on this star count has everything to do with price vs. the food. Had it been a little less expensive, I would have given 3 stars.First, the Pros:-Friendly Service-Easy Seating (we went on a Monday night so didn't expect a huge wait but still...)-Eclectic atmosphere. I like that this place is in a large, old house up on a hill. The inside looks very much like a historic home. The rooms are well-painted and they had someone playing piano; it made for a little bit of elegance.-All the food is organic and either grown at the restaurant or locally sourced (big points for that!)The Cons:-First and foremost, the food was just not cooked properly. Looking at the menu, I was a bit surprised things weren't a more expensive given everything was local and organic but, after it arrived, I felt like we paid too much. I had the ""Romeo & Juliet;"" steak medallions with mashed potatoes and greens. I ordered the steak medium rare and, when it came out, the overall appearance of the food was just blah and the steak was very overcooked. The taste of the food was good but I left feeling I could have cooked everything I had there myself and, possibly, better.-My husband's lasagna was about the same. Tasted good but not good enough for the price tag.-The menu was a bit mixed up. I got the vibe they are possibly trying to do too much and don't seem to have a true focus.I hear this place is going to be on Restaurant Impossible and I look forward to trying it again after the revamp. I think they are going in a good direction and, it seems to me, they do care very much about the quality of the food they are serving.

The restaurant itself just didn't seem clean.  There were items on the buffet which were unrecognizable. I believe a goopy light green tureen was spinach/artichoke dip. There was another offering of some type of salad, maybe shrimp salad, which would have been a choice for me if it was labeled.The buffet had the usual meats, veggies, waffles, biscuits and gravy, shrimp cocktail and an omlette station. Honestly, the best part for me was a nicely cooked piece of ham. Otherwise every thing else was either almost empty or just overstayed its welcome (dried out).The only shining spot was the server.

The attractive $16.95 plus the 3 mimosas for $10 incentive makes this a regular stop for my local family and friends as well as those that visit to satisfy that weekend hunger one only feels between 10am- 2pm. It should be illegal to serve Premium cuts of beef and pork accompanied by fresh fish, chicken, shrimp, various pastas, pastries, and a table of homemade deserts all together...all at one time...impossible to sample it all. Then for all those craving breakfast fare a delectable selection of biscuits, gravy, waffles with fruit and whipped cream topping...and as every country boy knows, a Southern breakfast table is only complete when fresh hominy cheddar grits also adorn it. But wait fellow fat kids theres more...lets put all of these options out to satisfy that breakfast and lunch crave, but lets also throw in a salad bar in which only local, organic fruits, veggies, and meats are served....and for shits and giggles lets let our award winning restaurant  owner/chef man...or in this case...woman the omelette station where her first question is ""oil...or butter."" A question never asked to me by IHOP or Waffle House before making my omelette, but one I was asked twice on this fine Sunday for 2 magically prepared omelettes. 3 different types of cheese to choose from,  shrimp, ham, chicken...very basic, but throw in fresh minced garlic, locally grown artichokes, sundried tomatoes, broccoli, mushrooms, and im looking at her hand while she is flipping this buttery masterpiece to see if she married or not... Because if she is regularly serving omelettes with all these options...someone has hit the jackpot. Of course there is nothing like washing all of this down with 3 mimosas for $10. Not just any mimosas but a variety to choose from as well as the best damn fruit tea this side of the Cumberland river! I must mention the Beautiful garden at the restaurant, which the waitstaff said they use for some of the fresh vegetables in the food. The restaurant  seems to be a bit dated, it is a somewhat renovated old farmhouse, so expect that Victorian vibe...also expect tables that probably were used by the originals inhabitants of the home 100 years ago...but no need to be snobby, tablecloths masquerade the age well, and still allow the food to be served in the most proper manner.

I was told it's unique, interesting, not cookie-cutter corporate, and very Nashville ex-urban. And it is! The food was fine. Enjoyed the Wedge Salad with Blue Cheese Dressing; thought the Southern Fried Rabbit was great, flavorful but better be very hungry cause it's heavy; and the Honey Whiskey after-dinner drink a perfect ending.

"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I love the ambience of Ellendale's and their food is fresh and delicious. The menu offers an array of variety embracing people with varied tastes. They offer indoor and outdoor seating, small intimate settings, as well as a large open indoor room. I went with friends and family and each one of us loved our meals. I had the shrimp and grits, which I typically try anytime I see it on a menu. Ellendale's chefs definitely put their own tasty spin on this dish by adding a hint of hot sauce to the rich cream based sauce and pairing it with grit cakes instead of typical boiled grits. The shrimp were large and cooked to a perfect texture. The blend of shrimp, sauce, and grit cake created a symphony of flavor that lingered ever so perfectly on the palette.The staff is professional, courteous, and thoughtful. The musician performing on a 20 string acoustic guitar performed a great blend of original compositions and popular hits. Yes, I said 20 strings. His guitar was a lovely historical instrument with multiple necks and his musicianship and expertise were exceptional. Throughout the evening couples would dance as the guitarist played and sang. Our evening was capped off with warm varieties of cakes and coffee. All of which were rich and delicious. The chef truely weaves a variety of flavors together that cause the senses to explode.

"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I had the eye of the tiger pasta dish. Very large portion size. It was ok... I guess I didn't know what cheesy Philly sauce was until now. It tasted like cheese and the red pepper flavor overpowered it too much. And it was not thick enough at all. It was as if the pasta sat in a pool of red pepper/cheesy liquid that made a mess when you ate it. The beef tips were good, until I bite into a piece that had fat on it. Wouldn't order this again. For dessert I had the lavender cheesecake with raspberry sorbet. I am a lavender fan, I enjoy the smell a lot. Never have I eaten it before. Frankly I am a crossroads on the taste. Not sure if I enjoy the flavor as much as I enjoy the aroma. I felt like I was eating my car air freshner a little. The sorbet was delicious, pure raspberries and exactly what I would want from a sorbet. Watch out for the seeds tho. Not a good date food. I'd come back again and try something different.

You ever eat somewhere and the first thing you start to think of is ""I wonder if Gordon Ramsey takes referrals or if only the owners can call him?"" Flies in dining room. Seated next to AC intake that was dusty and funky. AC vent overhead hanging cockeyed out of wall. Service was a bit slow, but friendly and accurate. Bread was a little stale. Stuffed mushroom app was fishy and bland and not cooked all the way, cheese on top still shredded and not melted let alone bubbly and browned. Mushroom hot not cooked though. Can't imagine that was how this was intended when it was dreamed up. Fish and chips? Yeah, so thin overcooked rubbery white fish in tempura batter laid over homemade fries like your mom would make from potatoes when she ran out of store bought.

"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"The wifey and I came into Nashville on business, but we also wanted to mix in a little fun by meeting some friends for dinner. We decided to try out Ellendale's on a whim, mostly because it was on the east side of town where both we and our friends were at.I was really excited to try Ellendale's after reading their menu online. To my disappointment, the menu on their website was definitely not the same as the one on site. The online menu had several entrees that I was considering (like Mahi Mahi Sliders), but sadly they were nowhere to be found once we arrived. I could understand if one of the review sites or Open Table had the menu wrong, but this was from Ellendale's own website.All of us seemed pretty famished, so we started with the Mediterranean Nachos for an appetizer. Basically, it's crisp pita triangles topped with garlic, hummus, red peppers, pico, goat cheese, pesto, and some sort of balsamic reduction. The pita was rock hard and there wasn't nearly enough of it to finish the toppings. The hummus was creamy and I really enjoyed the balsamic. Something had a spicy kick to it, but only intermittently. The flavors are there, but it's lacking in execution I think.For my entree, I picked what I thought was a safe choice: 14-ounce New York Strip with asparagus and a baked potato. I ordered my steak medium, but it was definitely well done. There wasn't even a hint of pink left. The steak was also a little gristly and tough to chew. I did like the Country Topping (bacon and bleu cheese), which had a nice bite to it.Disappointing food aside, the service was also a bit lacking. We didn't get silverware and napkins until after they brought our appetizer, and even that was only because I asked for it. Our entrees were also very slow to arrive. The restaurant didn't seem horribly busy, so I'm not sure what the hold up was. Our server was really nice at least, so that's something.I feel like Ellendale's has the potential to be a really great restaurant, but there are quite a few fundamentals that need fine-tuning first.",Ellendale’s,6158840171,541 reviews,2014-05-05,"Nashville, TN",/biz/ellendales-nashville-2,2.0,233,"Washington, DC",Jared K.

"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Disappointing.   We are from out of town and ended up staying overnight at a nearby hotel.  It was Mothers Day and on the spur of the moment, we thought we would go out for dinner and were looking for something a bit different.   Called in advance and we were happy to hear that they had a reservation!   Walking up, we were pretty excited  - the establishment looks like a house and definitely not ""cookie cutter"".   However, the experience went downhill from there.   We ended up in a line (3 or 4 groups) but that is not a surprise given the date.   I was surprised that there was one hostess who seemed to disappear for minutes at a time - to take care of one thing or another.  And she did not even seem to acknowledge any of us still waiting.   Finally after about 7-8 minutes (yes, I started timing it), another manager came up and let us know that they were a bit backed up and it would ""be just another few minutes""    He suggested we wait at the bar.   We chose not to (thankfully) because the first hostess came back to explain that the actual problem was that the kitchen was backed up and they were pausing on seating anyone else (including those of us with reservations) - it would likely be another 20-25 minutes.   This was after waiting for 10 minutes already.   I understand that things get backed up but when I have a reservation I don't typically expect to stand around waiting for 30-35 minutes because they didn't plan well.wish I could review the food but we chose to leave - as did others that were in line.   Since I will not be back in the area, I may not have a chance to go here again.  Then again, I am not sure I would want to rely on them.",Ellendale’s,6158840171,17 reviews,2015-05-11,"Glenview, IL",/biz/ellendales-nashville-2,2.0,233,"Washington, DC",Kelly T.

The food was described by the waiter fabulously however actual taste was meh. Kitchen staff came out to replenish the buffet bar with no hair nets, no gloves, etc. The building has crossed over from that quaint lovely farmhouse atmosphere to run down and shabby. The silverware looked old worn and cheap and was rolled into the napkins wet. The napkins smelled so musty/soured that I had to ask for paper as the smell was making me nauseous. The salt would not even come out of the shaker because of some kind of moisture problem. We were seated by a window that had a ""family"" of flies buzzing around - a couple of which constantly buzzed our table. Annoying at best - not good to think of with an open buffet of food. We went upstairs to the banquet room to check it out as a possible venue for our Holiday event. Up here you can really see the slopping ceilings, where they have had water leaks, horrible shape!

The toasted focaccia was hard as a rock and wouldn't even soak up the sauce.  This place would be  consistently great if they cared as much about the sides and service consistency as they did the more expensive entrees.  My party was disappointed.  The lunch buffet is renowned, but the phrase ""all you can eat"" covers a lot of woes.  We realized it was an early Monday timeslot, but stale bread, grits made like polenta and bitter, steak medallions too tough to eat, and less than attentive service with an almost empty restaurant really brought down this review.",Ellendale’s,6158840171,14 reviews,2015-08-25,"Livingston, TN",/biz/ellendales-nashville-2,2.0,233,"Washington, DC",Danny L.

However, it was suuuuuper pricey. I went for Sunday brunch, and brunch for two plus two mimosas was over $50. Maybe we weren't charged properly or something, but that seemed insane to me.

"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"It had been over a year since I visited Ellendale's for Sunday brunch. In the past, it has been very hit or miss. Today was definitely a miss and I can say with certainty that I will never return here for brunch again. The quality of the food just isn't there. More than half of the items on the buffet were picked over, nearly empty and looked very dry. When you're paying over $15.00 for brunch, you expect better quality. We informed the staff that several of the items on the buffet were empty and it took a while for them to refill it. The cheese fondue, which is usually one of my favorite things,  was completely empty and people were actually scraping the pot in an attempt to get some of the remaining cheese residue. Why were we the only people who saw this? Whose responsibility is it to keep the items fresh?I thought I'd get a salad while they refilled the buffet, but my Caesar salad was swimming in dressing to the point where the lettuce was soggy. Not appealing at all. The only thing I enjoyed was the fresh watermelon, an omelet and a few strips of bacon. The items on the hot and cold buffet fell extremely short.As if all of that wasn't bad enough, a woman took the stage and began singing and playing the piano. If she was talented, it might have been enjoyable. Her singing actually prompted me to get the check and leave. We couldn't take anymore.The only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one is because our server was very attentive and kept our drinks filled. I don't blame him for the poor good quality and empty containers.",Ellendale’s,6158840171,75 reviews,2014-08-10,"Nashville, TN",/biz/ellendales-nashville-2,2.0,233,"Washington, DC",Jeannie G.
"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I'll preface my review by saying three things: 1. I had Ellendale's New Years Eve and it was incredible. 2. I did not retaliate against the server he did fine and I tipped 20%. 3. Everything I'm about to tell you is 100% true. So, it all began a couple weeks ago as me and my girlfriend were discussing Valentine's Day plans. She wanted something a little trendier, a little newer, something close to downtown. I told her repeatedly how amazing Ellendale's was on NYE. The place was packed, service excellent and quick, and the steak and baked potato was incredible. So she gives way to recommendation and we book a 7:30 Valentines dinner. It all went down hill from there. We walk through the front door and it reminded me of an overcrowded doctors office. The wait staff and hosts were frazzled noticeably. There must have been 20-25 people crowded in the hallway of this restaurant. All had reservations. I heard rumblings of complaints from other patrons. The vibe of upset customers and frazzled staff members was almost to much to bear so I headed for the bar. Went with a Dos Perros which turned out to be the best purchase of the night. As I'm headed back to the crowded hallway to wait, I don't believe my eyes. IS THIS REAL. A mouse scurries past the hoards of people waiting just feet away from people eating. Unreal. 30 minutes and 2 beers after our 7:30 reservation we are walked upstairs to our seat. I actually looked around for cameras. This had to be a joke. We were seated at a rickety old table covered in cheap table cloth right next to a utility closet. WITH THE DOOR OPEN AND LIGHT ON. Servers were coming in and out of the room to grab cleaning towels. There was also small heater of some sort plugged in and a bucket of ice. These were in my sight line and my girlfriend was directly aligned with the toilet. The bathroom door remained open when not in use (with the light on). So we're literally placed between a utility closet and a bathroom. Both less than 3-5 feet from us. If the mouse didn't kill the romantic vibes, this seating location certainly did. All this and I'm still not to the food. Honestly, I won't drag it on much longer....as bad as the experience was leading up to our food being served, it didn't really matter how good the food was...but, on par with the rest of the night, it was awful. They had a ""special Valentine's menu"" with only like 4 entrees to choose from and they had names such as ""sloppy kiss"", ""hugs and kisses"", and ""she's a V"". With 4 entree options how hard is it to mess up?? Oh and we started with an appetizer sampler plate which wasn't THAT BAD. It was a little cold and the kale chips tasted rubbery and cold but were seasoned nicely? As I feared, with people still waiting downstairs, the food was rushed out to us in no time. At least they're trying to get people seated?? My 6oz steak wasn't horrible but the ""loaded baked potato"" looked and tasted like a microwavable item from Wal mart. My one regret is not taking a picture. The potato I was served was nothing close to the one I was served on New Years Eve. My girlfriend tried her best, but couldn't force down anymore of the bland chicken she ordered. I was especially appalled at her side of asparagus. It was especially bad because I had cooked asparagus the night before that was 5x as good as what was served to us. In closing, I apologize for the length of the review and I do truly hate leaving negative feedback. I've never once left a bad review on any website for any restaurant. As I previously mentioned, the waiter did his job so I tipped appropriately. I wasn't looking to pull the scam of complaining to the manager and getting free food (although the table next to us was offered ""desserts on the house"" to which they declined). I can truly say, for $104 dollars, it was the worst dining experience I've ever had.",Ellendale’s,6158840171,1 review,2015-02-15,"Nashville, TN",/biz/ellendales-nashville-2,1.0,233,"Washington, DC",Lackey S.

"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I honestly don't even know where to begin. We too fell prey to the outrageous ($32 a person) Mother's Day Buffet. Never again. Please know that I rarely leave negative reviews and often support local restaurants, but felt very compelled to write this after yesterday's experience.Upon first entering the restaurant for our special family lunch, I immediately noticed how uncomfortably warm it was. The temperature was reaching 90 outside and it felt like a sauna inside the restaurant. Every server in the place was covered in sweat! One diner was even crouched in the hallway with a glass of ice water to her neck trying to cool off. Since the restaurant is in an old house I decided to overlook the lack of air.Onto the service...I was a waitress for 4 years and am very forgiving, but I saw our bus boy more than our waitress! I wish we could have given him the tip! Especially considering we waited for her to greet us and take our drink order for 15 mins and when she returned she had to ask each of us what drink we had ordered. Again, as a former waitress I realize that Mother's Day is one of the worst days to work, so I tried to be understanding.As for the food, I'm not even going to waste your time reviewing each thing we had.

"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I ate at Eelendale ' twice this week, first because it was close to my hotel and the 2nd time because I enjoyed so much the 1st. I sat on the patio the first time and had the healthy hugger with a glass of the citrus sangria. The weather was perfect and I loved looking over the garden. The chicken was overcooked but the broccoli, steamed kale and baked sweet potato made up for it. The sangria was only ok.Tonight, I sat in the bar area next to a window looking out on the patio and enjoyed the music of Mandy Cook while I enjoyed the vanilla beet & goat cheese salad with shrimp.

Dining in parlors and bedrooms fostering remnants of lives long past and the conception of the yet to come, Ellendale's was built in an nearly untouched historic farmhouse. The staff is extremely fun with pranks like bringing you a Bloody Mary when you order a Budweiser then trying to convince you that the Bud is a Bloody Mary! They have an untouched dirt patch on a hill you'll wonder about but eventually you'll learn it's the veggie & herb garden that supplies the whole restaurant year round. The staff made of robots, aliens, and animated corpses tells fantastic stories, it's how I know of the Japanese hornet that spits acid in your eyes. The drinks are never dull, the ingredients change with every order! If you're bored with the sounds of live bands they have an organ which is to die for.

The coy pond, fed by a fountain you can buy anywhere but won't look as good as here, is like none other!

We got a table with only about a 10 minute wait but the serve never brought our drinks and got our salad order but never took our food order. After 46 mins we decided to leave without eating. We asked for our check and the owner was very nice to comp our salads. She also offered to comp our meals if we stayed but we were thoroughly frustrated and didn't want to deal. Our server was Lance and he was obviously preoccupied.

"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,My review is mainly based on Sunday Brunch but I can't imagine any other time being much different. On the surface the buffet seems like an upscale buffet with some pretty cool choices but after the meal is over I always feel underwhelmed with the food! Bland all the way around. Really love the old home but an interior remodel starting with the carpet is past due. The piano player in the large room is a nice touch. Service is usually equal in quality to the food. Really wish I could be excited about Ellendals but I just can't.,Ellendale’s,6158840171,59 reviews,2015-03-22,"Nashville, TN",/biz/ellendales-nashville-2,3.0,233,"Washington, DC",Robert P.

"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"By FAR, the WORST place I have stepped foot in.  We can start with the organ music playing on a sunny afternoon  - more like a morgue.  There was an eerie feeling that this place is hiding something - every server told a different answer for each question - down to what whiskey the restaurant even served.   - The bartender did not speak - and would only respond to the owner.  I had to walk in to get my drink as it took over an hour and I saw my waitress dancing in a circle  - she waved and told me to take it and kept moving to the organ - I was in disbelief.   - They told us to turn and see the garden, we did, and there was a cut branch off a willow tree stuck in a dirt mound.  I thought it was a joke. - no, that was the garden. - The buffet leads directly to the restrooms and has a strand of lights over it - when my friend went inside the restroom he was greeted by a catatonic waiter standing, not moving - he was in a state of shock  - The waitress finally came back for a drink order and told me that she was so busy with a party - there was a party, but there were also 40 people on staff.  She started yelling and stating that she was indeed serving 28 people and that she was 65 years old and knows how to multi task - apparently I was not a ""task"". - The next waiter told us he was a bird in his past life and loves insects that can kill you with acidic sprays - we were appalled.  He was lying to us and trying to scare us.We literally ran out - and I mean RAN OUT",Ellendale’s,6158840171,5 reviews,2015-05-14,"Nashville, TN",/biz/ellendales-nashville-2,1.0,233,"Washington, DC",Dave W.
"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Like other reviewers, I took my mom for Mother's Day.  We had an 11:00 am reservation and were not seated til around 11:45 am.  We stood in the foyer watching the hostess almost have a meltdown.  They were scrambling, and it almost seemed like they didn't understand why or how to fix it.  A manager or someone with experience really needed to step in and help, but that never happened.  I kept joking with my family that I was treating them to dinner and a show. Once we were finally seated, the room we were in was miserably hot.  Thank goodness I had a sundress on, so I was comfortable, but the rest of my party was not.  Even the servers were dripping sweat.  The food was ok.  Not exceptional but for $16.95 it was good.  Then, like the others, I got the bill and it was double what I was expecting.  False advertising for sure.  We were so miserable that we didn't have time to wait for the manager. I called back later but no one would answer after 5 attempts.I really wanted an omelet from the omelet station but after standing in line and watching the omelet chef's messy cooking style, I decided against it.  Toppings were going everywhere and pans weren't cleaned properly between omelets.  I didn't want some of the toppings that were left in the pan or fell in when they were making others.  What if I was allergic to one of the toppings?After deciding against an omelet, I went over to the cold salad table.  I was excited to see shrimp cocktail but then noticed the shrimp were not on ice anymore but were bobbing in water.  The ice hadn't been changed, and I didn't know how long they'd been in the water.  I warned my entire party not to eat the shrimp for fear of getting sick. Ellendale's has the potential to be something great, but it sadly is underwhelming. If the pricing was as advertised or if they did something to reimburse me for the false advertising, I would go back.  But since it is likely I will never hear from them, I will not return.",Ellendale’s,6158840171,11 reviews,2015-05-11,"Nashville, TN",/biz/ellendales-nashville-2,1.0,233,"Washington, DC",CC S.

"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I really, REALLY wanted to have a stellar experience here.  ...and for ""stellar,"" I'm sure you'll agree that it has to be a perfect combination of food AND service, along with ambiance.Well, it just did not quite happen this particular night. (Please note:  this is not the first time I've dined here...far from it.).Ellendale's is an unpretentious little house nestled in Donelson, with a casual dining atmosphere, but a topnotch menu.To be clear, the food here is very good.  There is ample variety and a nice mixture of entrees, along with an attractive array of veggies and starches.  (They also change the menu periodically.  Sometimes, they add more attractive entrees, sometimes not.  By the way, I REALLY miss the smoked Ribeye.  Brink it back, won't ya?)Additionally, the wine selection is good and they pour a healthy bourbon.This evening, we had a family dinner for a special occasion.  We sampled:Me:- The Filet  - an 8 oz. slug of beef (plenty), cooked medium rare.  Very tender and full of flavor. Scalloped potatoes and roasted green beans.  The Wife: - The Amaretto Chicken:  grilled chicken breast with amaretto glazed mushrooms and almonds.  Paired with sweet potato spaetzle and wilted greens.  Very good.The Daughter: - The ""Romeo and Juliet""  - a nice blend of sirloin (12oz.!) served with blue cheese cream and demi glace. Paired with truffled mashed potatoes, wilted greens and a grilled tomato.  She really enjoyed it.  (I tried it, too - and, the tastes were excellent with both the blue cheese cream and the demi glace.)The Son: - He wanted the Rabbit! And it was very tender.  It had a white wine sauce with rosemary, thyme, and portabellas.  The ginger mashed sweet potatoes were particularly tasty!As I've described, it was very good food.  Alas, it was the service where they fell short this evening...nothing outright bad, per se, but it just did not seem we received the attention a $150 tab should command.  The server gave us adequate time to select our entrees, but never returned to learn if we were satisfied, until we were done.Nonetheless, I've given a 4-star rating, as it was good food and ""okay"" service.  BUT, to really set themselves apart, it would be nice to see Ellendale's step up their service and attention.  The menu implies it is to be expected.  Customer loyalty should certainly command it.  And, I deserved it.",Ellendale’s,6158840171,106 reviews,2012-10-08,"Nashville, TN",/biz/ellendales-nashville-2,4.0,233,"Washington, DC",David L.

With food, wine and a cocktail, I thought the total bill was reasonable.I snagged the last available reservation for this restaurant, not realizing it was Valentine's Day. My first clue was when the parking lot was full with all the nearby street parking taken as well.Being Valentine's Day, the place was incredibly busy. I was offered a seat immediately. I opted to sit at the bar and ordered promptly. My entree (NY strip with sweet potato) took just over an hour to arrive. The food was slightly warm. The steak was overcooked, lacking the topping I'd ordered, and the sweet potato was fully garnished, even though I'd ordered it plain. The bartender recognized the issue with the steak topping and sweet potato and immediately fixed it.Two or three people sitting at the bar mentioned that they had eaten here two days in a row. I had the impression they, like me, were travelers, and they obviously had good experiences in their prior visit here.Overall, I had a very nice evening, and I enjoyed the food even though it wasn't perfect.

"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"My husband brought me here for a surprise dinner date. I liked how the restaurant looked like a historic home. We were seated right away in the music room, where there was a great duet singing covers of recent hits. They were the best part of the night. My husband ordered the shrimp and grits, which he loved. I tried some of it and thought it was a little on the spicy side, and I wasn't a huge fan. I got the Romeo & Juliet sirloin, which was well-cooked and seasoned (minus the bleu cheese that was a little funky). The wilted greens and the mashed potatoes were excellent.  The dessert was my least favorite part. We got the tiramisu. I was really excited to see that it had coconut on it... but the taste of brandy was so potent that I could only eat two bites. I know you can usually taste a hint of liquor in tiramisu-- but it's usually more subtle than what I had at Ellendale's. The average price of an entree for dinner was around $20, which isn't terrible, but at the end of the night... I felt something was left to be desired.

I settled on the ""Romeo and Juliet"" for my main course--a  combination of steak with a blue cheese sauce and steak with a wine sauce separated by a large helping of mashed potatoes, tomatoes, and greens.  I must say that it is the very best dish I have ever had in a restaurant.  Everything tasted fresh, and the beef was obviously grass-fed.  To finish, we had the ""paulamisu"",  a layering of cake, pineapple, coconut, and brandy.  The service was excellent and as we finished our early dinner, the entertainer began playing wonderful ballads on the grand piano.  Great experience!  I will definitely be back!",Ellendale’s,6158840171,12 reviews,2014-05-04,"Marion, AR",/biz/ellendales-nashville-2,5.0,233,"Washington, DC",Elizabeth B.

Here for a family event and wishing I had ate before I got here. We were seated in a private room with 2 person wait staff. We had a pre set menu for our party of 25. The waiter was pretty good but the waitress was horrible. He may as well have waited on us by himself. It took 30 mins to fill our drink order for water. Refills were by inquiry only. Caesar salads were served without Caesar dressing. It took 20min before I realized my waitress wasn't going to bring it so I asked the waiter who took less than 1min to bring it. My gf's medium steak was as flavorless as it was devoid of heat. My exact sentiments for the uncajun pasta. Only if we had known that the prearranged menu meant we would be served previously cooked food. *** FINAL NAIL IN THE CULINARY COFFIN***HOWS ABOUT A LITTLE STOMACH BUG TO TOP OFF THE NIGHT!

We should have bailed at that point, but we didn't know where else to go. Once we finally got inside, the service was slow (drinks took about 15 or 20 minutes to arrive), and frankly the food was a real disappointment.  The turkey looked and tasted like chunks of turkey loaf, smothered in some sort of gravy, and several of the items had what could best be described as an ""odd"" taste -- not spoiled, but just not appetizing. They also tried to crowd too many tables into the restaurant. It was difficult to navigate through the restaurant without bumping into another diner.

"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Came here looking for dinner since I was staying at a hotel down the road. The house is a neat setting and they grow a lot of their produce on site. I sat at the bar and the bartender was super-friendly and attentive. Great service. They had some live music, an acoustic musician which was really nice. Regarding the food, I found it a little hit or miss. I had the Iceberg Wedge salad and it came with crispy onion straws, bacon, sun dried tomatoes and bleu cheese dressing. It was very tasty and I liked the combo of toppings. The proportion was slightly off so I needed to ask for more onion straws. Next I had the bruschetta. In my experience, bruschetta is always a gamble. They make their bread in house and then make the crostini from that and the texture of the bread was very good. My problem was the bread was soaked in the balsamic vinaigrette. You only need the slightest hint of balsamic, so a strong a flavor it is. There was basil ice cream to cleanse the palate, which was tasty, but it more like rescued my palate from the balsamic overkill. Again, proportions were off.Lastly, I had the Tiramisu. Be forewarned -- this is nothing like tiramisu. It was a real disappointment and I should have sent it back but I was so exhausted from my day I just tried to eat part of it. It was basically a slab of cream cheese and I do mean a slab, with some shredded coconut sprinkled on top, a few bits of pineapple thrown in, and some dry cake. Again the problem was with proportion. A ridiculous amount of cream cheese to all the other ingredients. Also, you need mascarpone to make tiramisu. When I heard it was all cream cheese, I was a bit confused, but decided to try it thinking maybe it was creamy like cheesecake, but no, it was literally like they unwrapped a package of cream cheese and threw it on a plate. I still get a bit queasy thinking of it. The ambiance is for the older crowd. Meaning on a Friday night there were a lot of elderly people. I was just looking for a quiet dinner, but overall not that impressed and if I'm in Nashville I wouldn't return. Service was great though, they just need to re-work the food.

We stumbled upon it looking for something that was close to the hotel we were staying at and am glad we gave it a shot. Cool ambiance once inside. some guy was playing a set on guitar that added to feel. Since it was our first time there out waiter walked us through the menu. I had the rabbit. That's right. Rabbit! Was super good, would have been better if not fried. Every thing on the menu looked great and the portions are massive! They had about 5 craft beers on tap and a large selection of wine.

"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Thoroughly disappointed in Ellendales! Went for brunch today with a reservation. Stood in the entryway for 15 minutes (10min past our reservation time) without even being greeted by the hostess, who was apparently in the back clearing tables. When we were finally greeted, there was no apology. In fact she barely acknowledged that we had been waiting. Brunch buffet was sub-par at best and overpriced for food that obviously came from cans and boxes. My date had ""orange juice."" We had to wait for them to ""make a fresh batch,"" so he was expecting fresh squeezed; instead, he ended up with Tang or some other orange koolaid equivalent. Biscuits were hard as a rock and the bacon in the buffet line was nearly raw - can you say food poisoning waiting to happen?

"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"So I'm giving this place 5 stars because it's just downright incredible. The ambiance is great. It's like Walking into somebody's warm and welcoming home. The service was world class. Our server was Rod and he was great. Knowledgeable about wines, the menu, and anything you could ask him. So we started out with a glass of wine. It was reasonably priced for a house brand. We had an order of bread with garlic butter. Now the bread hits you with a punch to the face with garlic. This is a good thing. If you like garlic don't miss out on the bread. It was incredible. We moved on to the bacon wrapped shrimp stuffed with crab. This was sooooo good 4 large pieces of shrimp with crispy bacon wrapped around it. Prepared perfectly. My wife had the new York steak and it was tender and juicy and prepared just as ordered. She had the baked sweet potato along with it. I had one of the best ribeye steaks I've ever had. I had the baked potato which was prepared perfectly. Both dinners came with asparagus that was very good. Oh and I forgot. We both had a wedge salad. The wedge was pretty good. Not the best I've had but still very good. We were too full for dessert but damn they looked good. The entire time we were there we listened to some local entertainment. It was a couple playing soft country tunes. They were great.

"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"As a Donelson resident, I certainly wish I could give this place a higher score. You see, the dining pickings are slim in 37214 and after a 5+ year wait from the last time I tried Ellendale's, I was hoping to add this option back on my list of neighborhood places I could count on. First bad sign - party of 6 was able to get in on a Saturday night at 7:30 without a wait. Second ding - they were out of rabbit. Third ding - didn't get our salads (to be fair, only 2 people ordered them). Fourth ding - only one person truly enjoyed their dish. Two of us had the shrimp and grits and man, it was just plain bad. The shrimp were the toughest I may have ever had and lacked seasoning - they may have been boiled. The dish was also lacking the dijon slaw accompaniment (which I didn't realize until after we left...I kept thinking it was missing something). Another person ordered the scallops and said the flavor was okay but they weren't cooked properly - no sear at all. Yuck.At least the bread was good, along with the herb butter. Someone at our table mentioned that it seems like nothing is made in house, and I tend to agree.

Everything was excellent! Our server was friendly and prompt. Food was great. Lots of variety and everything very tasty. The oyster shooters and shrimp were fresh, not soggy which can happen on a buffet line.

I would just suggest calligraphed name tags on some of the less known dishes. I got a sample of what I thought was fondue but it was squash based.

Mine was the ribeye and I must say that I was disappointed in how fatty the steak was.  I like the flavor of ribeye, but this was a bad piece of meat.  Everyone else enjoyed their meals.Service was good.  Drinks were reasonably priced.  Overall, it was a good meal and I would go back.",Ellendale’s,6158840171,351 reviews,2010-05-21,"Keller, TX",/biz/ellendales-nashville-2,4.0,233,"Washington, DC",Marc M.
"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"After reading mixed reviews,  my family and I decided to try the Sunday brunch this afternoon.  I was anxious to try all the delicious things, but I didn't see any of it on the brunch buffet. The blue cheese sirloin was very chewy and hard to cut, and the only other entree choice was bbq porkloin that had been there for awhile. I decided not to eat, I couldn't see spending $15.95 on dessert.  The omelet station was the only redeeming quality about this visit. The air doesn't keep up, so the whole family was covered in sweat. Almost everyone kept asking to move, and they just kept seating people in that room. My biggest disappointment was that what is charged for your children is based on server discretion.  Meaning they can guess how much your child ate, and then charge you accordingly.  I've never heard of anything like that in all of my restaurant experience!  My 1 and 2 year old who split an omelet and drank nothing were charged $10.

I laughed at the one where the youngest guy was 44 (in my case I was the youngest at 33). I took it at face value the poorer reviews and came because of the strength of a 4 star.The appetizer was awesome. I highly recommend the Mediterranean nachos. The Caesar salad was ok. I liked the baked cheese touch. The main course was a sweet n sour fried tofu. This was not what I expected. The tofu was good. However the be of greens and unidentifiable white stuff was weird. Next time I'd order the other tofu dish (something about tofu, zucchini etc). The ginger ice cream was ok but not as good as you can get in any Chinatown.I will say the service was amazing!

"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"What a neat spot.  I've been here twice now while in Nashville for work and really enjoyed it.  The reviews on Yelp directed me here and the hotel I stay in is only about a mile away, so it's perfect.The first time I dined here I had the Salmon Pasta and it was outstanding.  The caper (one of my favorite nuances) and olive marinara was unique and mouthwatering.  The second time I went (last week) I had the ""Raspberry Lava Chicken and it was just OK.  The chicken could have been a bit more tender, and maybe larger in portion.The environment is entirely unique, however.  It's in an old huge house and everything is nice and rustic.  Service is very friendly and I believe I heard the bartender say that they have live music every night?  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town and I'll stick with the Salmon Pasta.",Ellendale’s,6158840171,100 reviews,2011-05-03,"Saint Louis, MO",/biz/ellendales-nashville-2,3.0,233,"Washington, DC",Benjamin S.
"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"We went here two nights while we were in Nashville.  The reason we went back was for the BBQ pecan bacon wrapped shrimp.  Other than that everything else was hit or miss.  Service was mediocre even though our server was very nice.  Anything that had bread with it (hummus plate, chicken burger) the bread was hard and dry.  The appetizers are where it's at.  The James Bond, shrimp, and stuffed mushroom caps were all delicious!",Ellendale’s,6158840171,8 reviews,2013-09-28,"Port Moody, Canada",/biz/ellendales-nashville-2,3.0,233,"Washington, DC",Kendyl M.

"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"My wife and I came here on New Years Eve and were subject to the special Holiday Menu. It all looked good and we went there based on a review in our hotel magazine. I also liked the fact that it was a local business wanting to use as many local products as possible. The setting being in an old house as well also helped make our deicison.We arrived and had to wait a few moments to be seated, this was expected being New Years Eve, so it was no big deal. There was a nice dark room to sit near the bar which was very relaxing. The staff asked us if we wanted to drinks and that we would be seated shortly. No problems here.When we were seated, we were enjoying a local musician at the piano singing everything from Billy Joel to Elton John to basically everything on the Classic Rock station. She was enjoyable for the evening and very welcoming to all the patrons and took requests.Our server surprised us from behind as our seats were put in a way to face the stage. He went over the menu with us and we ordered our appetizers and dinner. My wife started with a salad. It was decent but nothing over the top. I ordered the rabbit pate and found it pleasant. For dinner, my wife order the half chicken. It looked good, but it was rather tasteless. The barley on the side was tasteless as well. I ordered the advertised New York Strip medium rare, which turned out to be a rib eye instead according to our server. That sparked my interest even more since I like that cut better. The steak came out and was undercooked. The server even asked me to check while he brought it to the table. Hmmmm.... It was still rather rare and in about five minutes he brought it back and it was cooked to my liking. After a few bites, one would expect a little fat here and there, but when each piece turned out to be fatty and stringy, I was getting annoyed. On top of all this, the steak was way too thick to be the rib eye's that I am accustomed to. I am almost thinking it was a chuck steak bought in bulk for New Years made to look like something else. I sent back the steak and decided to order the pork chop instead. The pork chop probably faired much worse than it actually was as my appetite was waning. The side of mash potatoes was decent but by that time I was done.I felt that all the servers were running around frantically for no reason. My wife and I both have worked in the restaurant business so I want to make it clear that I am not just complaining. They were far from understaffed but could not seem to accomodate their tables in a timely manner. At many times, I found servers hiding in the bathroom hallway or servers not even present and rarely coming out of the kitchen area. I cannot speak for other tables, but for the few around us, there were not many smiles based on the service and the food. If something was happening in the kitchen, it was very obvious on the faces and personalities of the servers.At the end of the night, our server tried to make nice with us and tried to make conversation over my wife's South American name. It did not help his tip at all. I think he knew we were upset with his service as well as the food.All in all, the best part of the evening was actually the OK lounge act the restaurant offered. She made the rounds to each table and wished us all a Happy New Year. What bothered me even more was that the restaurant was not overcrowded. There were empty tables scattered throughout and still the servers were unable to perform their jobs properly. The kitchen had a smaller menu for the holiday and still they were not able to make quality food for the price we were paying. The restaurant must have known what the dinner service was going to be like with the reservation book as well as the usual walk-ins.This restaurant we will definetly overlook the next time we are in town to visit.",Ellendale’s,6158840171,63 reviews,2012-01-02,"Kansas City, MO",/biz/ellendales-nashville-2,1.0,233,"Washington, DC",Ian P.

"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"My first inclination was to give Ellendale's 4 stars but taking everything into consideration it comes up a little bit short. First the bad: when we first arrived my wife and I were left waiting in the reception area with no staff in sight. That lasted for a few minutes. Not a good start. I really like the location of Ellendale's and the fact that its setup in an old farmhouse. The ambiance is very nice. Our server was friendly, the guy in the corner playing piano was good and not too loud. I ordered a Gentleman's Manhattan to start the meal and it was excellent. The restaurant was out of both appetizers we were thinking of ordering so we jumped into the entrees. This is where I really felt let down. I ordered the Creole Chicken. The rice and the tomato were very good. The sauce was very good. The chicken was leather. I mean really tough. I'm not one to leave food but I left a good portion of that shoe on my plate. My wife ordered the grouper and was a little surprised that it came breaded.  We reminded ourselves that Ellendale's is ""traditional"" American and not ""new"" American.  Never one to turn down anything breaded and served with a cream sauce (her words), she enjoyed it.Dessert was where Ellendale's really stood out.  My cheesecake with ginger ice cream was excellent, and my wife's sorbet had thick chunks of raspberry that made it more substantial than you would expect.  Glad we went.  Liked the atmosphere.  Would probably give it another shot if we were back in town and staying in this area again.",Ellendale’s,6158840171,32 reviews,2009-10-11,"Portland, OR",/biz/ellendales-nashville-2,3.0,233,"Washington, DC",David H.

"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"After hearing so many awesome things about Ellendale's, my boyfriend & I decided to enjoy our Valentine's Day dinner there.  However, enjoy we did not.  The host wasn't there for the first 5 or so minutes that we stood in the main lobby area, and when he did show up he didn't apologize for the wait or even wow us with his niceness.  In fact, he didn't even speak to us while he walked us to the table, which was right by the far too loud entertainment of the night (basically a moderately talented piano player belting out cheesy songs).  Then on top of this...they didn't have calamari, which surprised me considering it's one of the only real appetizers and it was Valentine's Day weekend!  Our dishes were very bland, and my boyfriend's ""Romeo & Juliet"", which was supposed to be 12 or so ounces of meat, looked like it was approximately 5 ounces.  He ordered it medium rare, and it was well done when they brought it out.  The entire experience was less than ideal.",Ellendale’s,6158840171,244 reviews,2012-02-26,"Nashville, TN",/biz/ellendales-nashville-2,1.0,233,"Washington, DC",Sam L.
"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Went for Thanksgiving dinner.  The buffet was reported to be one of the best in the area.  Food was good, but a bit disappointing experience overall.Arrived a few minutes early for our 2:30pm reservation, had to wait outside.  Watched as several larger parties arrived (with 2:45pm reservations) and was surprised to see that they were immediately seated.  Once we got inside it was complete chaos.  Servers and guests bumping into each other.  We struggled to keep up with the speed demon hostess - my father-in-law moves in an obviously slowly manner  - the hostess didn't care and wanted us seated, her impatience was painfully obvious.The waiter we had was great.  Attentive, quick, friendly - he saved us from a horrid experience.  Buffet was full of Thanksgiving favorites.  Turkey, Ham, Roast Beef.  Tasty food and plenty of it.  The flow of the buffet was very odd, as if they just randomly placed tables of food out and hoped for the best.  The chaos of guests and servers all getting food and placing food out, made it difficult to navigate.The cleanliness left a whole lot to be desired.  The bathroom was a bit scary.  I saw servers touching food with bare hands, and guests touching serving spoons with their hands.  (edit - people touched the spoons on the serving ends, not the handles, with their bare hands)  Not what I was anticipating given that they are supposedly known for their buffets.  Staff might need some refresher training in proper food handling!Price for three of us, with drinks was $150.00Overall - Worth a try when it's not on a holiday, food was plentiful and tasty.  I might try it again, but might not.",Ellendale’s,6158840171,77 reviews,2008-11-30,"Alexandria, VA",/biz/ellendales-nashville-2,2.0,233,"Washington, DC",Andrea v.

"2739 Old Elm Hill PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,My wife and I got in from Florida on an early Friday evening flight so the hotel recommended us making a reservation here. Very pleasant and exceptional service.  The restaurant is a converted large home on a hilltop in the Donelson area and hold a very nice ambiance upon arrival. We were seated in a front parlor room with a small fireplace by the window which we enjoyed. Martini's and Bruschetta started things off. The wine list was adequate and we quickly found something to our liking.

Even though the crowd was pretty sparse (which always makes me nervous), the food was good.There is a menu, but I did not even look at it. Everyone apparently eats at the buffet, and I can see why. It's mostly southern food on the buffet, but there were plenty of options. You can always fill up on the salads at any rate. There was some good roast when I was there and broccoli salad which is my favorite. I tried not to pig out in front of the recruiter. Ellendale's is not on my side of town, and I'm not sure I would make the drive all the way over there to eat lunch or dinner. If you work or live in the area, it is worth checking out.

As for the flavor heavily char smoked and the meat was on the tough side. Not much flavor, and traditionally the Rib-Eyes have great flavor and tenderness due to the marbling.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"This is such a fun experience! You must be adventurous to come here and enjoy it for your money's worth though. If you are just getting regular cuts of meat like beef and chicken, I don't think this place is worth the price for you.So the basic concept is a buffet where you serve yourself sides and put up a little marker to show you're ready for the meats. Everything is all you can eat.Our server was very nice and even though she's gone through the explanation spiel a million times I'm sure, she was very warm and took time to explain everything. They did a good job of incorporating Brazilian things into the menu--each table gets a starter of 3 appetizers that are all Brazilian themed: fried polenta, fried banana, and a cheese popover. I also ordered a Caipirinha, because it's the only Brazilian drink I know! I got mine with strawberry and coconut, and it has big chunks of fruit in it. It was very tasty!They have an amazing bar of sides. You serve yourself the sides, and then the meat is brought to you by servers. There were so many delightful salads to choose from. My favorite was the roasted coconut salad, it was like a coconut cole slaw! They had couscous salad, quinoa salad, kale salad, and tons of other sides to choose from. They had macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, baked ziti, and a few other non-salad sides. This sides bar is well stocked and has tons of choices--probably 20 different items I woulds say. I could have filled up on this alone.Service was rapid! When we turned our marker over for more meat, they would arrive one after the other! We had to quickly flip the marker to stop them, because they would just rapid-fire offer us a new meat before we could even take a knife to what was on our plate already. It was great! And all the gentlemen carrying the meat skewers were very nice and chit-chatted with us.Meats we tried: Japanese pork, lamb, some kind of white fish (forgot what is was!), sweet and sour chicken, some other kind of chicken, a few different cuts of beef, Rocky Mountain Oysters (Google it...), Yak meatballs, Rattlesnake sausage, Elk sausage... I think that's it?I love the yak, the ""oysters,"" rattlesnake, elk, and the rare beef. The fish was good, but I prefer a whole fish to just a slice :P As for me, yes there were a few cuts and types of meat I didn't like, such as the lamb (it was awful, but I've never had lamb before either). But that didn't detract form the experience at all, since I came prepared for an adventure. Overall, I really enjoyed the food. I do feel it is a tad overpriced at $35 a plate, but I can see how having all those exotic meats can raise the price up. I was originally worried that there wouldn't be enough rare meat, since that's how I like my steak. They had a good mix of rare and more done though, so I was happy to see one steak cut into that was very bloody.

We were both excited about finally trying Rodizio. The food was amazing; we enjoyed every appetizer, every salad bar item, every side, every meat, and our dessert! We showed up with empty stomachs and left absolutely satisfied.Our server was awesome! His name was Will. He rocks! Our gauchos were great, too. Everyone who approached our table with food was very informative and hospitable.So why only 3 stars?We had a reservation. We showed up several minutes before our reserved time. The waiting area was packed. I checked in and was told our table would be ready in a couple minutes. Those without reservations were told it would be an hour. Believe me, I was so glad I made our reservation! While waiting, I overheard a couple parties talk about how they had been waiting for about 30 minutes...and they had reservations, too! We all continued to wait. One person (with a reservation...and at the same time as ours) asked the hostess how much longer till he would be seated.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,Firstly when we called they made us dress up per dress code. Yet the place was full of shorts and slippers/flip flops. It's July and hot. When I went to the bar to get a wine menu. I was greeted with need something.  Had to wait for ever to get water. Way to long. The food at its best was ok. Best part was salad bar. Which $35 per person for that is ahhhhhToo many bland tasting or ugh foods and poor follow up. Ate at many great restaurants this week in Nashville. Try any place else. Trust me.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"Love the atmosphere! Fantastic salad bars & desserts. The garlic sirloin & the bacon wrapped, Parmesan chicken were my personal favorites. My husband like the salt & pepper steak & a little bit of all else. Ceviche on the salad bar was fresh & so refreshing on a hot, humid day. Love the staff & the fact that my water glass was always full! Great service! We enjoyed it so much we had supper there 2 days in a row. Crime brûlée for dessert the first day, they infuse it with oranges so it tasted somewhat like an 'orange creamsicle'....I love cremecicle brûlée so I didn't appreciate the twist, but it was good nonetheless.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"This is a must try for anyone who has never had the rodizio experience (beau was a newbie), and a definite stop for someone who doesn't know what they feel like eating, as you get everything!The location is right off Broadway so it's very convenient, and we made reservations, which I would definitely recommend you do as well--the place was packed.  Would have liked a little more space between tables, but otherwise, it's a very nice set up.With the fixed menu, we paid around $34 for the full meal, which includes appys, salad bar, the meats and dessert.  Not bad at all.  The drinks were a little on the pricey side, but not ridiculous.For appetizers, they bring you banana fritters (from platanos maduros), polenta and Brazilian cheese bread.  You can get seconds if you'd like, but I recommend saving space.The salad bar was very clean/neat, and had a plethora of choices ranging from salad items, cold cuts, veggies, rice and potatoes. Again, you can visit the salad bar as much as you'd like.For the grill, they brought around several varieties of steak, ranging from sirloin to flank, lamb, chicken, turkey wrapped in bacon, sausage, chicken hearts and fish.  Quality ranged from beyond excellent to just okay, but overall, it was all worth it.Price wise it's a bargain, just be sure to come hungry!",Rodizio Grill The Brazilian Steakhouse,6157308358,40 reviews,2015-04-04,"Parlin, NJ",/biz/rodizio-grill-the-brazilian-steakhouse-nashville-2,4.0,185,"Washington, DC",C M.
"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"I won't get into a whole spiel about various Brazilian BBQ , I will just compare this Rodizio to other Rodizio locations (like Salt Lake City) and that comparison is not favorable. I think a lot of the pretty positive reviews may be from less experienced n00bs.Meats- were pretty meh, and that's generous. Cuts were always thin and overcooked, there was almost no outside pieces available when they brought it around, the Gauchos need a little training in how to properly slice the meat (as this as possible for most cuts etc). They came around sporadically and we often went 5 or more minutes with no meat being offered. They also loaded up on like wine marinated chicken and other nonsense meats no one wants but were super light on picanha.Sides- we only got brought sides once at the beginning. They were all cold. The mashed potatoes couldn't have been more than like 3 ounces for a table full of people. The cheesey poofs were very flat and de-poofed as well as cold. They were never refilled. Salad Bar- we went for lunch and got there at like noon which should be busy time but the place was pretty empty. The hot sides had all very clearly been sitting their untouched for quite some time and had a thick skin on them- super appealing. Service- as discussed under meats not great. Also there is valet parking for like 10 dollars since its impossible to park on the street anywhere nearby. The valet parked our car about 10 feet from the valet stand. It then took 13 minutes from when we left the restaurant to when a valet showed up and got our car which we were standing by the whole time.",Rodizio Grill The Brazilian Steakhouse,6157308358,150 reviews,2015-01-14,"Las Vegas, NV",/biz/rodizio-grill-the-brazilian-steakhouse-nashville-2,2.0,185,"Washington, DC",Scott P.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"I have no idea why some people give this a low review. If you look they have minimal reviews, so basically some just come out to complain. And if they complain, they must be either really really mad, or embarrassed bc they don't want anyone to know who they are. We were there for Brunch. I was concerned we would not get the whole experience, but was happily wronged. The Hostess was so nice when I called THAT day for reservations--right before Church--what was I thinking?  God was watching me...saying get in here and we will let you out after. Valet was 7 dollars. I was a little surprised no one warned me here. Shame on you Yelpers. Now you know! Please feel free to tip on my paypal account for these pearls. JOKE BIG JOKE.  So they take my car we are off. Hostess was again as sweet as she was 1 hour previously and I asked to sit near the grill. Another Yelper told me this. No Grill seating but next to salad bar. Yeah OK let's see what happens. Well we had 2 not 1 waiters in about 5 minutes giving us the 411. I was not in the mood for a beverage, but friends had the specialty Cipriahana--spelling but you know what I mean the rum and lime drink and the soda- Antartica which tasted like a sweet Sierra Mist with Orange. Hands down, I liked the water. Salad bar had tons of things, but no Ranch or Blue Cheese Dressing. Had Caesar and Italian and lots of different vinegretts so that was fine. It was Brunch so there were eggs and bacon and different casseroles and rice and whipped with cream mashed potatoes. How many WW points I did not bother to add up. Lots of different salads and black beans and there were rolls and banana bread. They had the largest hearts of Palm I have ever seen. We had a little very little of most things, but did not want to fill up. When we turned the green thing, my friends said it felt the swarmed. Swarm Swarm Swarm like on Seinfeld at the bookstore episode. The meats were steak, sirloin, skirt and 2 others, Not Filet- I did not care, but heard some random guy ask. Well really, we eat Filet a lot, the meats compared to Filet were top notch. Also a few types of Chicken and Sweet and Spicy. Also a white fish and Chicken hearts which reminded me of Large Almonds with a intense Chicken Flavor. There was some Pork around and some Lamb but truly we did NOT gorge. I know that people say to do that, but really the worst feeling in the world is that full feeling.  We also had a birthday but I requested to opt of out of the singing. They do a wonderful Birthday song, but really we did not need that. Some friends had another drink, and we asked for the dessert menu. No such thing, they bring the cart. Would have liked for someone to try the Passion Fruit Mousse, but only the Flan and the Chocolate wonder were chosen Chocolate thing was really really sweet and the Flan was thicker. The Creme Brullee has Orange liguor in it. Oh the apps like the rest of the Yelpers are stating are 3. Fried and bread. Fried banana app, very very very banana tasty, Polenta ""fries"" and then the Cheese puffs. Again we waited for the main course. Oh they give you a drink menu only. The rest is salad bar and the gauchos. Also there was this dreamy guy named Michelle. One of the Gauchos. Could listen to his voice at anytime. He was quite helpful. All our servers were helpful.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"First off let me suggest you make a reservation for this establishment. I spoke in detail with the hostess over the phone discussing the menu as I have a gluten allergy. She was beyond helpful and after learning that it was my first time dining there, suggested that I come on a nearly empty stomach. I'm glad I listened to her. First you start with the run down of how they operate there. Very unique and great experience. Not sure why more restaurants don't incorporate the idea. This is one you'll have to experience for yourself. They have a generous salad bar with tons of fixings. Good crisp lettuce and don't pass up the bacon strips. They are smack your granny good. The other side of the salad bar is all the sides. Each one is labeled GF is they are gluten free which made my life much easier. Then when you are ready the fun begins. The meat begins to come in waves. As much as you want.....yes you read that right. As much as you want. The first meat that came to us was chicken hearts....I passed on this one. The peppered steak and honey glazed ham was some of the best I have had. They would occasionally bring by grilled pineapple which was amazing. The meat was good in its own unique way. Now I like more seasoning on my meats but then again I've never ate Brazilian so what do I know. The food was a great quality and the atmosphere was great. I will probably be back at some point. The price for our meal was $34 per meal.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"Not my first time at this restaurant, but this will be my last. One of the servers was so intent on hitting on (flirting with) the 4 girls at the table next to mine that he ignored me on every pass. I certainly didn't show up at Rodizio's to watch an attempt by what appeared to be a server with a fake limp hit on a table full of young girls while I'm blatantly ignored.  My ""Serve me indicator"" (or whatever the Brazilian restaurant industry calls it) was green up each time he passed my table and I tried to make eye contact with him just for grins.  He totally snubbed me.  I'm telling you, this guy was something else.  If you watched him as he wandered around the restaurant you would see him walk normal if he thought no one could see him from the dining room.  As soon as he stepped into the dining room he would start limping like he just broke his leg.  Crazy stuff.  Maybe he was telling the young girls he was flirting with that it was a war injury.  Who knows? Just for the record, the girls were not flirting back with this loser.  I felt sorry for them for having to deal with this guy.I've traveled worldwide for 29 years for business and pleasure, so I'm qualified to judge the service of a restaurant from a diner's point of view. I continue to be amazed that a restaurant will put people like him in a position to interact with patrons.  What purpose does it serve?  I guess it will remain a mystery to me.   Also, after I told my waitress I was finished eating, it still took her 15 minutes to bring my check (see below - very slow night).  Maybe it's ok to sit there while waiting for your check if you are dining with someone else, but if you're traveling and eating alone, the wait is very noticeable. Now, had the restaurant been overflowing with customers one could almost make logic of the arrogance of the restaurant employees.  But, let me assure you, the number of patrons was so small that they had us all crammed into a small dining area.  I can't figure it out - maybe the owners have so much money that their customer satisfaction isn't important to them.   I wonder if the owner of this restaurant actually reads reviews of their restaurant on high profile websites like this.  I travel on an expense account, so the only skin I have in this interaction is my time and my digestive health.  For the good people that travel to Nashville TN and spend their hard earned money for a good dining experience, please be aware that Rodizio's is not all that it should be based on my personal experience.  Oh well, I guess I won't burden this restaurant with my money in the future.",Rodizio Grill The Brazilian Steakhouse,6157308358,2 reviews,2015-09-01,"Moody, AL",/biz/rodizio-grill-the-brazilian-steakhouse-nashville-2,1.0,185,"Washington, DC",Wayne D.
"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,I visited Rodizios while in Tennesse. I have to say that the food was good. The service on the other hand was absolutely horrid. Worst I have ever encountered. We had a party of 18 since I was visiting family and granted the bill was divided but this waitress took an hour and a half to figure things out and it still was never right. The food is one price but the drinks and desserts were extra. She insisted we ordered more drinks and desserts than we actually did. She apologized for being new which duh we figured. Management kept having her come back when they should have stepped in right away. We ended up overpaying when all drinks and desserts should have been free because of the trouble. Terrible service from server and management. Would recommend finding another steakhouse to visit while in Tennessee.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"Went here for my birthday celebration last year, not being able to find many other options with a table for 5 on a Saturday night without further notice. Had no clue what to expect, but my dad had spoken highly of another Brazilian Steakhouse he'd been to in Germany. Was immediately impressed by the appetizers as well as the size of the salad bar, and who can beat an endless array of meats walking around the building at all times. Chicken hearts definitely hit the spot and a lot of the other meat options were amazing as well. Dessert options looked absolutely amazing, ended up having the chocolate cake option, and would've loved to try everything else as well. Can be quite a bit pricey, but is definitely worth the experience at least once. Servers do an amazing job never seemed to have an empty glass or empty plate of food.

We had the chocolate cake for desert, it has a Brazilian name but I don't remember it either. The combination with the sauce over it was stellar.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"We come to Rodizio Grill on occasion where we're in the mood for a LOT of meat (believe it or not, that does happen every now and then, even to this mostly chicken and fish kinda gal).  We love the atmosphere, the friendliness of the staff and gauchos, the variety of meats, salads and sides, and those incredible cheesy bread things that are part of the appetizers served on every table.  Really, those cheesy bread things are good enough to eat as a meal on their own - YUM.The meats offered have always been good quality and seasoned nicely.  On a few of our recent visits, the chef gets a little carried away with the salt shaker and the meat is very, very salty.  I enjoy salt, but this has sometimes been a little much even for me.  That being said, the meats are cooked well and the gauchos come around to every table consistently.  If you leave Rodizio Grill hungry, it's your own damn fault.  Also, the gauchos will ask you which meat you enjoy the most so they're sure to bring it to you until you've had enough, which I think adds a nice touch of hospitality to the restaurant.  My personal favorite meat is actually not meat at all, but the fish option - it's ALWAYS good and I gobble up as much as I can while I'm there.  The grilled pineapple is also a nice palate cleanser between the different varieties of meat.I will say that I've never been super impressed by the bar selections - the cocktails are often VERY sweet and light on the liquor for their high pricetags.  That being said, Rodizio Grill does offer nice wine and beer lists to enjoy with your meal.  I will stick to those whenever I come again.I've also had a few work functions in their party room, located in the back of the restaurant.  The waitstaff and management do a fantastic job to make sure all of the guests are well taken care of - it's a great place to throw a party or host a corporate event for those who love to chow down on meat.  The $10 valet parking is also a great bonus, especially if you'd like to enjoy downtown Nashville after your meal.",Rodizio Grill The Brazilian Steakhouse,6157308358,126 reviews,2014-04-28,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rodizio-grill-the-brazilian-steakhouse-nashville-2,4.0,185,"Washington, DC",Tracy F.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"Man, I'm pretty torn about this review... I think I should preface by saying I'm not a huge meat eater/lover even though I do eat it and enjoy being a carnivore on occasion. So if you are a meat head and love it... maybe I'm not your best review to read. However, I will continue with that disclaimer! This was my first time ever being at a Brazilian steakhouse, but I knew the standard; price fix menu and unlimited supply of food. To be honest, I have never had a desire to eat at one of these restaurants, but as it was someone's birthday I came along for dinner. There are two options; full rodizio with unlimited meat and salad bar for $32.99 or salad bar only for $18.99. Multiple people have told me this is a great deal as most Brazilian Steakhouses are around $50 per person. After taking a look at the salad bar and seeing all of the food available, I went with the salad bar only and it was PLENTY of food. I enjoyed it; they offered hot dishes and cold ones as well with some hits and misses, but overall pretty decent. I snuck a bite or two of meat from my boyfriend's plate and it was tasty, but I didn't find myself upset that I missed out on it to be honest... some feedback from the table who did partake in the meat selections said that there were some cuts of meat that were amazing, others were a bit tough. They also are pretty good about cutting off big pieces if you want that. I did get a bit frustrated having to say ""no thanks"" over and over again to the gauchos who were bringing by meat. It was better once we told our server that I was only eating the salad bar, but I still had to say ""no thanks"" again and again. One of them it must have been his first day because he didn't have hardly ANY muscle in cutting the meat and had some difficulty getting pieces off. So you see my dilemma... $18.99 is a bit steep in my opinion for a salad/hot bar only, but it was good. It's nice to have the option to opt out of the full experience if you are trying to save some money or have dietary restrictions. I think vegans are a bit screwed....just don't come here if you are vegan period! I keep going back and forth between 3 and 4 stars but I think I have to go with my gut and give them a 3.. I can't see myself rushing back unless it is someone else's choice.NOTE: My BF said he would give them 4 stars if that helps; he had the full meat experience!",Rodizio Grill The Brazilian Steakhouse,6157308358,484 reviews,2013-09-05,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rodizio-grill-the-brazilian-steakhouse-nashville-2,3.0,185,"Washington, DC",Sheena T.
"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"Hands down the BEST rodizio I've been to thus far (been to Fogo de Chao, Texas de Brazil, and a handful of others in various cities)So I arrived at 9:15 thinking I wouldn't get the full experience getting there so close to closing which was 9:30. Boy was I wrong! Between me (I was dining alone) and one other party of six we had the place to ourselves and the service was great! Fast, attentive, asked me exactly what I wanted and brought it right out to me (they don't try to fill you up on the less expensive meats like other places)The salad bar was not as fancy or exotic as other brazilian steakhouses but they had a hot bar that had more choices than any place I've been before. ok best part of the whole thing -- THE TOP SIRLOIN. Simply magnificent! Perfect flavor, tendy, juicy, melts in your mouth! Totally makes up for the fact that filet mignon is not one of the cuts here, because man oh man that top sirloin is better than the best filet you could ever imagine.The second best part is the delectible pineappple they bring around --- it's glazed and grilled over the flame just like all the other meats making it sweet, juicy, and succulent. (see photos!)The only negative I have to say is that the cheesy bread was a little hard, like it wasn't fresh. Probably because it was the end of the night. The bread is my favorite part of the whole experience, so I was disappointed but if that's not the case for you then this is the place to go!",Rodizio Grill The Brazilian Steakhouse,6157308358,44 reviews,2014-03-07,"Charlotte, NC",/biz/rodizio-grill-the-brazilian-steakhouse-nashville-2,5.0,185,"Washington, DC",Alycia B.
"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"OK, so what could make a delicious traditional Brazilian rodizio of meats even better? If you guessed bacon, you would be right.Since living in salt lake city, the rodizio grill has been my favorite restaurant. I went to it for the first time in 1999, right before I went to live in Rio de Janeiro. The rodizio grill is a great representation of a traditional Brazilian Churrascaria and is my favorite place to go to make me feel like I'm in Brazil again . I would also say that the Nashville installment is even better than the one in Utah.Now, back to bacon. When I went in January it was Bacon month, and there were several more of the meats that hat been paired with bacon. Also, at the salad bar there were several different local bacons for you to try. The jalapeño bacon was especially good. If that weren't enough, the pao de queijo also had bits of bacon in it. When we were offered refills on the delicious little cheese breads, we were given both the original version and some more of the bacon ones. They came right out of the oven, and were perfect. The rodizio of meats brought many different varieties. They seemed to have the perfect combinations of degrees of wellness. My wife was able to get the well done pieces she wanted and I could get the more medium rare pieces. Most of our choices were also the ""first cut"" pieces, which are the best. They are the ones who've been exposed directly to the fire and salted directly. I'll still say that the picanha is my favorite. The staff was great and brought us the few meats we wanted to try again at the end of our meal. I want to say Anna was our server's name and she did a great job.For the first time, we also got desert. The brigadeiro cake was an enormous portion that we shared and still only got half way through.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"Brazilian steak houses are always interesting to go to.  It's a contest between your eyes and your stomach and which one will ultimately win (spoiler, its your eyes).  You get not only an endless ""salad"" bar (every side possible under the sun on top of salad) but what seems to be an unending parade of meat.  I mean, all possible kinds of meat.  Not just your classic steak and chicken but ham and pineapple and chicken hearts and every possible piece of cow you could ever think to try.  And admittedly, all really good.  Like, really good.  Some are seasoned and some are just plain perfectly cooked meat.  It comes on a giant metal pike and its cut right onto your already ""salad""-filled plate.  You have a little stop/go button to summon these purveyors of carnivorous indulgence, turning over green when you want more and red when you need a break.  They also come around with carts filled with different shots as well.  I can honestly say this makes a great place for large parties, but not so much for chatting one on one as you are pretty much stuffing your face all the time by default.  But, it was good, filling, and fun, if you're a meat lover of course.  Not so much fun for vegetarians.  Not a quiet place at all also, FYI (complete with birthday party singing by all the staff).  Also, being on second avenue means it's a little touristy.  However, again, if you are having a big party of visiting friends who love meat, or need a serious carb-up before hitting Broadway, this will definitely do the trick.",Rodizio Grill The Brazilian Steakhouse,6157308358,299 reviews,2014-02-19,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rodizio-grill-the-brazilian-steakhouse-nashville-2,3.0,185,"Washington, DC",Bridgette C.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"Was my 1st time eating at this place, I have a number of complaints, (1) Valet Parking. The valet was ridiculous, the car was never parked in one spot it was parked on the street and moved at least 5 times, if a spot opened up further up the road they would move every car behind it forward so the valets wouldn't have to parallel park. I Might as well have just payed somebody to circle the block in it till we were done eating.(2) The Appetizer. when the appetizers came they only brought 3 pieces of 3 different items for a table of 16 people, the server was apologetic and said she would bring more out, by the time more came I was already done eating the dinner part. (3) Meats. we were told we would we have choice of 12 meats, only 7 meats came to our table with a glazed pineapple as one of the meat choices, the meat cuts were small 1 bite per cut, it was also way undercooked beyond Rare, I assume that this contributed to the reason why everybody at our table was throwing up or getting diarrhea for the rest the night, I started getting sick before I left I had to walkout and find a place on the street to throw up because the bathrooms were full and I couldn't wait in the long line.  (4) Price. The waitress said the price for all you can eat was $34.00, when I asked for the check the previously nice attitude of our waitress flipped, She first told me she would get it when she had time in a tone of voice as if It was a major inconvenience I then explained to her that the food was making me sick and if she didn't bring my check I was leaving without paying she then came back very quick with the check. When the bill came she added a $7 Service charge I assume this was because I asked for my check before she was ready to give it to me. When some other people at my table complained to the staff they were offered no discounts no apologies and were told that they needed to have more patience because they were really busy, (on a sidenote it's not the customers fault because you're too busy!) I rate this place with one star because for a high-class dining experience at $50 plus per person I found it appalling that they would expect the customer to pay it forward for their mistakes and overcrowding especially when it's reservation only, I'm usually pretty forgiving and won't write a review on a place till mistakes have been made on multiple visits but for a pricy and classy environment like this I have no patience for the price it should always be 100% good Needless to say I will not go back there ever!

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"This was my first time in Nashville Tennessee and I've been seeing billboards and recommendations on this steakhouse so I decided to try it. My conclusion is 2/5 stars and this is why: Pros: they have a magnificent salad bar with a variety of foods. Our actual server was very nice and attentive. Also, the choices of meat were decent. Cons: their staff is extremely inexperienced and rude, the dining was rushed, the meat was not cooked to temperature, and no variety of lamb. In dealing with staff, their servers didn't ask about how we would like the temperature of the meat. When I asked to have something medium rare, it was given well done or rare. In cutting the meat, the staff had virtually no idea how to properly hold a steak knife and slice the appropriate width of meat. The meat either came too thin that it wouldn't be a slice, or it would be so thick that it was tough to slice through it. Out of our table of 6, they asked 2 people whether they would like the meat. The other 4 were not at all acknowledged. On top of that, when my friend said he wanted a piece, one slice was cut for me, then the server left in a rush bc ""others requested"" that cut of meat. Their staff also pushed through plates, and knocked over forks to sit the meat on the table for cutting. Rather than staying around the empty spots in the table, they chose to squeeze through couples and ""make room"" on the table to cut. After our forks were knocked over, there was no apology and they were quick to leave. I requested back 2 cuts of meat, and only 1 was brought back. The one that was brought back was not cooked to the approximate temperature that I requested, and the staff seemed annoyed that I asked for a choice of meat to come back. Also, The cheese bread was fairly burned and stale. I can genuinely say, I'm extremely disappointed and will never come here again. Maybe because Houston has so much competition, they're precise and detailed in the dining experience. I felt like I was at a fast food Resturant dining here and I did not feel welcomed nor enjoy the dinner. I hope this Resturant takes more detail into presentation, training, and service of their staff. From the time I walked in to the time I left, I was disappointed. Although there might not be many other Brazilian steakhouses in Nashville, that is truly no excuse to serve with less than mediocre service and at a bare minimum standard of food.",Rodizio Grill The Brazilian Steakhouse,6157308358,17 reviews,2014-10-28,"Houston, TX",/biz/rodizio-grill-the-brazilian-steakhouse-nashville-2,2.0,185,"Washington, DC",Julie D.

I will also say it was at least 20 min after turning our marker to green that we finally got the first entree that was actually beef.  Even after all of the meat I ate one of my favorites was the grilled pineapple!

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"Just having a dinner here one night should be sufficient to earn you a Meathead badge.For $32.99, you get a Full Rodizio meal which includes appetizers (Banana Frita, Polenta & Pao de Queijo aka Brazilian Cheese Bread), grilled meats, and full salad bar. To order the meat, you flip the wooden peg to GREEN. To stop, flip to RED. To order desert, flip it horizontally so the YELLOW faces up. Delicious grilled meat runs from beef, lamb, chicken, pork, to fish. The sweet and sour chicken is a must! It was my favorite out of all the 10+ meats I tried. Grilled pineapple and grilled tomato with parmesan cheese are also available if you want to get away from the meat a little bit. The salad bar was pretty amazing. There were so many types of salad, but my favorite was the Quinoa salad. The good thing about this place is they offer variety of Gluten Free salads. For drinks, I had the Hot Sunset (?). My friends had the Caipirinha (Brazilian classic cocktail) and something else on the list Gabriella recommended. They all were very good but not to point that made me drunk. We had the Flan and Orange Creme Brûlée. They both were delicious and not too sweet. Customer service was EXCELLENT. As soon as we turned the wooden peg to green, every 10 seconds there was a Passadores (Good-looking ones *cough*) came to cut us meat. The waitress was also very attentive. We asked for hot sauce and they had Siracha sauce for us (Siracha at a Brazilian restaurant!!). They weren't being cheap on the sauce either and gave us a full cup of it. We didn't need to make reservations on a Monday night, however I recommend to make one if you plan to go on weekend. This place can get crowded pretty quickly. They also offered valet parking here ($7 on weekdays, $10 on weekend) but we decided to park a little farther. After eating all of those delicious food, a long walk was much needed...For the ladies, I recommend you wear a dress or something comfortable (you'll thank me later).Check out this place, y'all.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"Was just alright. I've been to several Brazilian steakhouses, and this was probably the lowest of all of them. The meat was alright, when we finally got it. I think we got kind of screwed by sitting in the corner. We only had steak come around once and there was only a tiny sliver left. We had three kids with us, so sitting around for hours isn't a very good option.The buffet bar had a couple of decent options, but all of the ones I had been to in the past had more of a fresh seafood selection, including mussels with tomatoes and garlic, etc.. I felt like for $32/adult, and a nearly $140 total bill with kids and a tip, we could've had a much better meal just about anywhere else in that price range.The Gaucho's, were all very friendly, and extremely helpful when they did make it to our table, so I left 3 stars for that, instead of 2.",Rodizio Grill The Brazilian Steakhouse,6157308358,170 reviews,2013-07-31,"Maryville, IL",/biz/rodizio-grill-the-brazilian-steakhouse-nashville-2,3.0,185,"Washington, DC",Danny B.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"I went here based on the positive reviews on Yelp. I love the concept of Brazilian steakhouse with unlimited meat and have been to Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil many times. However Rodizio is nowhere near those places. The prices at Rodizio are slightly lower but quality is nowhere near the other Brazilian steakhouses i have been to. There is absolutely nothing I like about this place. The meat quality, the service, and the distribution of meat were all poor. The restaurant's layout is just inefficient. I won't even talk about the salad bar because this is a stake restaurant but if I had to, it would be another negative for the restaurant.The Meat: Every cut, and I will admit there were not many, I tried was dry and absolutely tasteless. The guys delivering the meat have no idea what they are doing. I kept asking for medium pieces but they would serve me pieces that was really well done or rare. Distribution of Meat: This was a complete disaster as we were seated near the bar area which is far from the action. We told our server several times that we were not getting any meat and he assured us that we will send someone over. Nothing changed. To be fair, the brown sugar glazed pineapple came to our table several times but i did not even bother trying it. I went to Rodizio for meat not fruits. At some point we were tired, asked for our check and left the place with some of us being still hungry. Yes, we were still hungry because we could not eat anything. How is it even possible to leave a Brazilian steakhouse hungry after paying $100+ for two. This is a first for me. Those who have visited a good Brazilian steakhouse would understand me here. The Service: Our server was incompetent. Him being incompetent was partially due to the fact that he was assigned to wait more tables than he could handle. But the result for us was an extremely poor service. Our drinks came late (he himself told us he forgot about our drinks). I asked for salt at the beginning of our dinner and he brought the salt right before we were leaving. I had the first couple of slices of meat in my salad plate as he was not around to serve us some clean plates. When I told him that we were not getting any meat, he asked me whether I was serious. I just pointed to the five empty plates sitting in front of us and he felt my frustration but did not do anything about this.Overall, we had a very bad experience at Rodizio and I will not go back. Not even to give it a second chance or even if it was for free. Another reviewer here on Yelp said ""Go to Rodizio, the feast is awaiting you"" .. Yeah, I totally agree that you should go to Rodizio if you are looking for ""a brown sugar glazed pineapple feast""",Rodizio Grill The Brazilian Steakhouse,6157308358,94 reviews,2014-01-26,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rodizio-grill-the-brazilian-steakhouse-nashville-2,1.0,185,"Washington, DC",mumin k.

On the occasions I have been there I have been impressed and very pleased with the food, the service, and the experience as a whole. To me it is an amazing value given the variety and quality. I enjoyed the rattlesnake sausage and the wild boar. There was a great pork tenderloin and an incredible ribeye. Now the sirloin was not the best but when is sirloin the best? The house special sweet and spicy chicken was awesome as was the fish that I had. I will grant that the salad bar is not outstanding but it is fine given the fact that this place is a carnivore's palace.I was just there this past Friday and I was more than pleased. The servers work as a team and the management is on point as well. I would recommend this place to anyone. Reviews are opinions and we know what they are compared to.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,Took my parents here for a nice surprise since my dad is a huge meat eater & my mom loves salads. Win/Win right? Wrong! I'm not sure where these reviews are coming from. Sure I give my bar drink & the experience 5 stars but certainly not the food. Please remember that is what we should be writing about. There were only two pieces of meat that were edible such as the ham & salt/pepper steak. The other pieces were either not cooked to the right temperature are very tough. The salad bar was worse than chain restaurants. I've seen better and tasted better at Ruby Tuesdays. We waited at least 5-8 minutes in between meat servings. It was extremely slow & when you tried to wave them down it was like they didn't see you. When you go somewhere like this  of course you expect greatness and this was far from great. Everything was a bit bland and very under seasoned. The selections for the meet and the salad / pasta bar were so very few. If you have ever been to a Brazilian steakhouse this would have been a sure disappointment. I had planned to bring my entire team of 80 people for a team building exercise. However I am so grateful that I came with my family first so that I wasn't the laughing stock of the building.,Rodizio Grill The Brazilian Steakhouse,6157308358,1 review,2015-03-07,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rodizio-grill-the-brazilian-steakhouse-nashville-2,2.0,185,"Washington, DC",Tiffany S.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"I'll try to keep this one short! Came here with my family on my visit to Nashville. Despite arriving early to our reservation and dodging the meth heads outside, they were able to seat us right away. Service was great. The waiter was very well schooled in his knowledge of the restaurant and knew his wines as well. Basically the dinner goes like this. You receive appetizers first (which were awful), grab your plate at the salad bar and get some sides (which were also awful), and then turn your wooden block on your table from red to green and they start bringing the meat around. The first two courses are probably just there to fill you up and keep you from eating all their expensive meat. Well I caught on to their plan and they didn't fool me, I went and got an empty plate from the salad bar and was on a meat only diet for the night. Well I did try some rice which was all right.The specials of the day were rattlesnake, wild boar, and frog legs. I tried the rattlesnake which just tasted like a piece of chewy fat. The wild boar was pretty good. The steak they brought around was the best of the skewers. All the food other than the chicken seemed extremely salty/overseasoned and I had trouble putting it down. Brazilian food is usually salty, but not this salty. The desserts are probably the best thing they have here. I gave this place 3 stars for their service and funny workers, otherwise it would have been a 2.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,Great Brazilian restaurant in downtown Nashville.  I've ate at several places like this including Texas DeBrazil and this one ranks right up there with them.  There menu has several styles of meat and their salad bar is diverse with lots of fresh and exciting items.  Some folks have commented on here about having chicken hearts on the menu.  First let me say this is a common Brazilian food item.  Second if you haven't tried it you should because they are delicious.  Aside from there vast array of meats they have some spectacular drinks.  We opted for non-alcoholic items.  My wife tried the strawberry limeade and I had a ginger ale type drink that was absolutely wonderful and refreshing.The price was cheaper than other restaurants of this style that we've visited which made it even better.  Service was fantastic and the manager made sure to stop by our table to ensure our experience was what we expected.,Rodizio Grill The Brazilian Steakhouse,6157308358,77 reviews,2013-11-23,"Pollock Pines, CA",/biz/rodizio-grill-the-brazilian-steakhouse-nashville-2,5.0,185,"Washington, DC",Eric M.
"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"Seeing as how I'm a huge fan of Texas De Brazil, I was really hoping for an awesome experience at Rodizio Grill, also. I was NOT disappointed. Rodizio is every bit as good down to the service, meats, salad bar, and even atmosphere. My boyfriend and I had a reservation for 5:30 on a Sunday. We were seated immediately and greeted by Marie, our friendly waitress. She promptly brought over the appetizers (which are included with the price of your meal) of banana fritas (chunks of banana fried with cinnamon-YUM), polenta fries-YUM, and Brazillian cheese bread-YUM! All appetizers are all you can eat. After we sampled all of those we made our way over to the salad bar. They had a huge assortment of crisp veggies to top your lettuce and also had quite a few ""ready made"" salads like Caesar and a delicious BLT salad. Also included were things like potato salad, chicken salad, mozzarella salad, and fruit salad. I believe some of their salad options change based on seasonal items. The ""hot dish"" portion of the salad bar had things like creamy mashed potatoes, different kinds of rices, sauteed collard greens with bacon, grilled vegetables, pasta alfredo, and chicken and beef stroganoff. Everything we tried was delicious! It is an option to purchase just the salad bar and forgo the meat experience and I will definitely say you would be absolutely pleased and full just off the salad bar alone if meat is not your thing. On to the best part- the meats. The Gauchos have 17 different offerings. Out of 17 we sampled maybe 10. I almost feel like I needed a list on the table to mark off everything I tried. My favorites were the Picanha, the bacon wrapped turkey, the sweet and spicy chicken, the marinated chicken, the sausage, the bacon wrapped parmesan pork, marinated pork loin, and the ham. I feel full after just writing that! The oooonly thing I was slightly disappointed with was the Brazilian Brisket. We heard the word ""brisket"" and was like ""Omg. Get that over here!"" Then we discovered that apparently Brazilian Brisket is the same thing as roast. It was served from a bowl with potatoes and carrots and it actually tasted fine but I am not a fan of roast due to terrible childhood roast memories. Ha. (Don't ask) We were thinking it was going to be like BBQ brisket but we were wrong. Oh well.During the course of our meal we had 2 bottles of wine and we got the cheesecake to go.

Nice selection of meat and fish on the skewers, if you have not eaten Brazilian before (no not that kind of Brazilian) then here's how it works. You help yourself to salad, and the gauchos come around with selections of meat from the grill. They carve at your table and you have a little ""device"" to let them know if you want to eat or take a break.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"I'll have you all know that I gave up meat for Lent and writing this review for Rodizio is bringing a tear to my eye.If you've never been to Rodizio, picture this: A festival of meat, where jolly Gauchos carry around spears of deliciousness with a sharp knife. Don't let this scare you, friends. These knives are the bringers of said deliciousness and with this comes a guaranteed happy tummy.Prepare to be served an array of meats from tri-tip steak (my fave!) to sausage to grilled fish (if you're lucky). I know this sounds like a smorgasbord on overload, but really? The entire experience is like a tasting and with the red/green table peg, you control the quantity, speed and everything else. (How does all that power feel?)Speaking of quantity, let's discuss the salad bar. I would have no qualms dragging my vegetarian BFFs down to 2nd Ave for these eats. This salad bar is no janky bed of greens! Instead, you can get everything from stroganoff, soups, caprese, fruit, cheese, quinoa... and yes, typical salads - caesar and strawberry fields, with BLT and edamame salads thrown in for good measure.Lastly, I'll add that the service we've received during our two visits are bar none! We're so smitten that we've even booked Rodizio for our rehearsal dinner. (Sneak a peek at their private event space in the back overlooking Riverfront Park and you'll understand why.)All that to say, GO. But only when you're hungry. Rodizio comes with a little bit of a price tag ($32.99 for the full Rodizio - unlimited apps, salad bar and rotisserie meats; $18.99 for unlimited salad bar), but trust me when I say: WORTH. IT.P.S.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"This is first review on this website, and I'm losing my Yelp-ginity to write an honest recommendation for this incredible restaurant.  Rodizio Grill has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in town.  Yes, I'm serious.  I have been there twice now, and I have even reserved their amazing back room for my Rehearsal Dinner this Fall.Truth is, I'm currently residing far too high on the food chain to be a vegetarian.  That's why I love Rodizio - they are so well focused on meat, and in keeps on coming after you've eaten from their incredible salad bar.  The BLT  and edamame salads are my favorites.Not only is the food completely delicious, the staff goes out of their way to offer you great service.  It's like Mark Rosenthal and his staff are genuinely nice to you and to make sure you have everything you need until you say, ""nao mais"" by turing that ingenious little peg over to the red side telling them to stop bringing you food.The only bad thing I have to say about Rodizio is that the drinks I've ordered from the bar were rather light pours. No big deal - I'll just make it up with some more of that fantastic Maminha.  Mais por favor! Give this place a try.  Just make sure you are extra hungry when you get there, and prepare to loosen that belt when you leave.EDIT: Our Rehearsal Dinner was a smash hit!  Our guests are still talking about the amazing food and service they got from Rodizio.  The Stadium Room is one of the best downtown venues for hosting parties.",Rodizio Grill The Brazilian Steakhouse,6157308358,9 reviews,2013-03-13,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rodizio-grill-the-brazilian-steakhouse-nashville-2,5.0,185,"Washington, DC",Jason M.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"We went with a big party.  Maybe that is why my experience was not as good as the other reviews.  Ok, I am not Brazilian but I am from South America, so I expect some fried Yuca on the side, and the sweet plantains to be just the plantains without being breaded. Also the cheese bread, was made with a bitter cheese, that I am not used to, but not too bad but sadly small. I had only one bite because they never asked if we wanted more.The rotations of the cuts, were OK.  The start was chicken with super small portions, I understand that its suppose to rotate, but the waiters were always rushing, and not very polite. I had to request a clean plate multiple times. The meats were OK, I would say out of the 4,  one  was delicious, in the other hand the lamb was HORRIBLE! tasted like it was spoiled that I spitted it out We also  never saw the sausage or the beef we liked again, it was one rotation and it was gone!  It   The only WOW thing was the Pineapple.  When I asked the waiter what the steak was he would rush with the description, and go to the next person. Not a smile, or a questions if you like it rare or medium or well. I would have to say there was ONE server that was polite and the owner was overseeing the table. The salad bar was OK, there was a good selection, and seemed fresh. We also had to share the green, red thing they put on the table.  It didn't make sense, since the 4 of us that shared it ate at different pace, and liked our meats completely different cooked, which seemed a big challenged for them to provide a well done steak. I preferred mine medium rare but the other people at my table did not, so they probably tried 2 steaks, since all of them were cooked the same way. I was so sad to be disappointed, the word of mouth of this place was amazing, a couple of friends raved about it! If you are in downtown and want a heavy meal before going bar hopping this might be your place, but if not  then is NOT worth it after parking and the small rotations, I would have been more satisfied with a good piece of meat, instead of OK, small pieces. If you are trying to eat on a Brazilian steakhouse I would recommend Bombachas since it has the same idea, and the service is a little better, not the best but they do have free parking! Otherwise, maybe try Rodizio at its lunch hour, they might be less busy and provide better selection and service.",Rodizio Grill The Brazilian Steakhouse,6157308358,1 review,2013-02-25,"Hermitage, TN",/biz/rodizio-grill-the-brazilian-steakhouse-nashville-2,3.0,185,"Washington, DC",Diana V.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"By far my new favorite restaurant in Nashville.  I wish I could score it 6 stars! The service was on point.  Very good, especially for a new restaurant open.  Typically new restaurants are working on kinks and sometimes the staff seems confused, but not here. We were seated immediately.  The server Jason, we very friendly and informative about the restaurant style. The gauchos were prompt and attentive. Great personalities, not to mention they were HOT! The owner and manager stopped by our table which is always a nice touch.  Parking was a convienent $10 valet right in front of the restaurant.  NO PARKING GARAGE FOR ME THANK GOD! Even the valet attendants were very hospitable. The salad bar was sooooo fresh. The couve was my favorite, and the strawberry fields salad was great.  I also loved the fresh mozzerella and proscruitto.  Yummy.The meat cuts were perfectly seasoned.  The variety just did not seem to stop.  The parmesean crusted sirloin was the best!  I could not get enough.  Certainly a great place for a date or group.  But surprisingly kid friendly enough (if you have well mannered children).  My 4 year old loved it!  He is very picky eater, but the meat was tender enough that my 4 year old's little teeth could really eat beef for the first time.  He loved all the beef. I could not believe that he really liked the food.  Normally I have to force him to eat!  It was his dad's birthday and he did a little birthday dance with the staff and the drum.  All the staff high fived him and complimented his dancing.  He was so proud of himself.  It was too cute!  He'll remember that.  We will too.Can't wait for more memory makers at Rodizio!",Rodizio Grill The Brazilian Steakhouse,6157308358,24 reviews,2012-12-16,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rodizio-grill-the-brazilian-steakhouse-nashville-2,5.0,185,"Washington, DC",Marie E.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"Last night in Nashville after a great week and wanted to enjoy a nice evening. CMA week is getting started so lots of people getting in. I had got online for reservations which is very convenient. We were seated and greeted shortly after by the manager. She was very sweet and you could tell she was on top of things. We started off with very nice appetizers of polenta fried and very crisp on the outside with soft middle as well as fried plantains. All were very good. The salad bar was very nice and we tried a tasting of each item. Then we got started with the third course which was the meat. I have been to various Churrascuria's in Queretaro Mexico that were top notch and this one had different varieties of chicken along with sausage, lamb, beef and pork. They do not serve tenderloin but for the price of $68.00 for two people that is not bad at all. In Mexico the pineapples were coated in cinnamon and roasted which were out of this world. Here they are just slightly roasted and carved. Still very good and sweet. The ambience is very nice and the staff are very prompt. The dessert tray is very nice and you must try one as well. When all said and done, we had a wonderful evening for a Ben Franklin.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"I took my husband out to Rodizio Grill last night to celebrate his birthday. He is a big meat lover and Rodizio did not disappoint! I read a few reviews on Yelp where people complained that the meat did not come around fast enough. We had quite the opposite experience- We were presented with a different meat option at our table every 1-2 minutes. Things moved along so quickly that I could hardly finish a bite before saying ""yes"" to another selection (not complaining). We were extremely pleased with the variety as well- anything from fish to chicken hearts to sirloin. I think in all we counted 13 different options, and I'm not even positive we sampled all there was to sample.I was most impressed by the salad bar. It was a great mix of both hot and cold items and offered a good amount of things I had never tried before. Actually if I go back to this restaurant, I will likely only get the salad bar instead of the full Rodizio- not because I didn't enjoy the meats but because there was so much on the salad bar I didn't get to try because I got too full. My only complaint about the evening is that it was not made clear to us at all that dessert was an additional cost (and I'll take the blame for not doing my research online beforehand). However, were just casually told to let our server know when we were ready for dessert, leading us to think it was included with the full Rodizio. My husband and I both ordered desserts, which were also very good, but we were so full that we each only had 3 bites of it before pushing it to the side. Needless to say I was a little miffed when I had an additional $14 tacked on my bill for something we barely touched. Live and learn. On a positive note, aside from this miscommunication, our service was outstanding! I never had to ask for a clean plate or a drink refill. Overall I am giving the experience a 4. Was it the best food you can find in Nashville? No. But if you're looking for a place that's different with a good atmosphere, vast variety, and quality food, this will absolutely meet your standards.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"Brazilian steakhouse, type A. Most of the meats were tasty and presented well. The salad bar is nothing to rave about. Basically an overgrown Ruby Tuesday bar. But, who really cares? Right?What killed it for me was the lack of training in the server corps. The guy serving the brisket got a little perturbed when I stopped him from pouring any more brisket juice on our party from his serving spoon. Our primary server, while a very polite young man, was never shown how to cut the foil on a bottle of wine or to twist the bottle at the end of the pour. Wine on table and mangled bottle = not cool. The above mistakes would usually just knock off one star from my rating. What destroyed the 2nd star was the ""happy birthday drum line"". That's right...drum line. One person with a small drum and another with a tambourine  cadence out from the kitchen followed by the other, embarrassed servers. You know the rest of the story.

Like others have said, compared to Fogo de Chao its probably second in line.  Their salad bar was a bit smaller in size but bigger in flavor than most. We loved their selections. The appetizer selections were slightly different than every other B. Steakhouse though. The cheese puffs were smaller and drier, and their plantains were actually deep fried bananas, which I didn't find as appealing.  They have a very wide meat selection, as well as a pot roast, pineapple and even chicken hearts (no thanks).  I think their price for dinner is also competetive, even cheaper than other B steakhouses.",Rodizio Grill The Brazilian Steakhouse,6157308358,43 reviews,2013-04-18,"Warren, OH",/biz/rodizio-grill-the-brazilian-steakhouse-nashville-2,4.0,185,"Washington, DC",Mjg Y.
"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"Visited Rodizio for the first time last night with my lovely wife to celebrate my birthday and it was absolutely great. We'd heard lots of great things about it both online and from friends and co-workers. When I saw that they served all you can eat meat, I made our reservation! When we arrived, we took advantage of their valet parking service ($7) and went straight in and to our seats. Luckily, we were right by the window and got to people watch as we ate. We were also right by the spacious bar which happened to be empty so I got to sneak a few peeks at the football game on the two TVs they had going. The whole place was decorated nicely and had dark but not too dark lighting, which I personally really like. Our waitress was very informative, nice, and helpful, giving us plenty of information since we'd never been there before. The appetizers we were served consisted of a cinnamon banana treat which was different and also a cheese puff thingy and polenta with parmesan. We liked the cheese the best. The salad bar was fantastic! Could have easily made a meal off of just that. Very wide variety of not so ordinary salads (my favorite was the shrimp pasta and my wife liked the spicy chicken). They also had some cheeses, breads, and meat (bacon, pastrami) as well as some soups, vegetables, and rice dishes. I lost count of how many types of meat we were served but we enjoyed all of them except maybe the chicken hearts which we really only tried to say we'd done it. My favorite was the garlic steak and she loved the garlic chicken. After we stuffed ourselves to the max, we decided to have dessert ANYWAY. Several options were available but we chose a sweet pastry with some ice cream and caramel drizzled on it. Again, I missed the name but it was very rich and delicious. We were very impressed with the atmosphere, quality of food, and very good service. We ended up spending right around $100 for the two of us but we did have a couple of drinks.

I would have gone to Monell and Arnold--both Nashville institutions for meats and 3. Please read their reviews if you ever go to Nashville.We had the lunch Full Rodizio for $17.99 a person.The Full Rodizio is a variety of rotisserie grilled meats, glazed pineapple, a gourmet salad bar and  authentic Brazilian appetizers.We started with the 3 appetizers of banana frita, polenta and pao de queijo, a Brazilian cheese bread made of yucca and cheese. All were tasty and unlimited .We only had a half piece of each.We had fruit salad, potato salad ,chicken salad, strawberry salad, hearts of palm, turkey pastrami ,and shrimp salad. We went easy on the salad bar. We each had about a quarter of  a tablespoon of each item. Needless to say there were more items in the salad bar that we did not take.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"Compared to other Brazilian restaurants (Fogo de Chão, Texas de Brazil) the price was actually decent, but it was immediately evident why. The salad bar was decent but lacking, the meat selection was on par with the above mentioned restaurants but the preparation was poor, and the service was terrible. Don't get me wrong, the staff wasn't necessarily rude (although they did bypass our table multiple times, only to return with either no meat or a poor cut), the problem was in their not knowing how to properly cut and serve the meat. The picanha, which is supposed to be cut so as to have a layer of fat on top, was being cut from the side with the fat being left off, which left half of what makes picanha so tasty missing from your plate. And to make matters worse, we were never once asked how we liked our meat cooked. All in all, it could have been worse, but then again it could have been much, much better. We won't be going back.

I frequented the now closed Bombasha that was located at 21st and Belcourt and mom and pop joint's in Philadelphia. Rodizio's first course consisted of fried bananas, cheese rolls and fried polenta sticks. All three of these dishes were quite delectable. There was a nice selection of salads, cheese's and anti pasta on the cold bar. This was the biggest selection of a second course offering I've encountered thus far. The main course, the meats, consisted of about 13 cuts ranging from Picanha to chicken hearts. There was also roasted tomatoes with a Parmesan crust as well as the always succulent grilled pineapple. As my lovely girlfriend pointed out some of the meats were a little over cooked and dry. Especially her favorite, lamb! We absolutely adored the lamb at Bombasha.

"166 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"So my girlfriends and I went to Nashville for my friends bachelorette party and we went to Rodizio on the first day. Our first trip there? AMAZING.

Now what we didn't know was the price change on the weekends but it was whatever. Our second time there was not so great.. We were hoping for the amazing experience we had received the day before. But our visit was ruined by ONE gaucho. He was disrespectful and rude. He stared us down and made the atmosphere feel really awkward. I know what you're thinking, your visit was ruined by ONE person?

All the other gauchos recognized us from the day before and was really nice to us and amazing but this one person, I will not name who, needs to be trained on how to treat customers better.

Service was excellent and the ambiance is what you would expect in a steakhouse - oaky dark colors.

I was pleasantly surprised by many aspects of Rodizio Grill- the attentive service, the large salad bar with something for everyone, and the properly cooked meat. The only reason they lose a star is because the meat was a little slow coming around, but the manager noticed this and started coming around with meat himself.

The rotation of meats was good and included chicken, spicy chicken, white fish,steaks (3 kinds), pork loin, and lamb. You could select your specific wellness (rare to well) for each cut, but the rare cuts were sometimes hard to find. The serving staff did attempt to please, and continued to bring back additional cuts. While tasty, the meats lacked depth and full flavor. That being said, for the inclusive price of $32.95/pp for salad, appetizer and meat selection the offering was a great value. The waiters, serving staff and cooks were very nice and attentive. I would return, but ask that the kitchen add some depth to the seasonings and possibly marinate some of the cuts.

The mild jerk is boneless, but the spicy appeared to have bones. Everything was good and very flavorful, but I'll branch out a little more with my sides next time. The greens also looked amazing and a jonny cake or patty would have been a good addition to my plate of mushy (in a good way) food.  Others looked like they had 2 sides and a jonny cake, so maybe I just got overlooked on that one?The atmosphere is nothing fancy, just a few tables and worn booths, but it does have it's own separate seating area away from the cafeteria-style open space used by the rest of the restaurants there.",Jamaicaway Restaurant & Catering,6152555920,188 reviews,2015-09-15,"Nashville, TN",/biz/jamaicaway-restaurant-and-catering-nashville-2,4.0,96,"Washington, DC",Lisa B.

"900 Rosa L Parks BlvdNashville, TN 37208",4.0,"This one definitely makes it to my personal top 10. It's a little gem tucked away in the farmer's market, a place that quite frankly, doesn't have a lot to boast of except for the food court which surprisingly offers a lot to choose from. My girlfriend couldn't stop talking about this Jamaican place that Guy Fieri stopped by. So we went. Like always, I asked the most solemn looking person in the staff what the one thing on his menu was that would bring me back to his restaurant and he instantly replied 'goat curry roti'. If you're getting one of their entrees, you get to choose 2 from an insane variety of sides. My girlfriend got the jerk chicken and  yellow rice and corn bread for her sides but I am told the steamed cabbage is worth trying as well. Grab a chicken patty (with warm coco bread, of course) to get that appetite working and a drink of their homemade sorrel and I promise you will hear Bob Marley 'stir it up' right inside your soul!",Jamaicaway Restaurant & Catering,6152555920,22 reviews,2014-10-11,"Rochester, NY",/biz/jamaicaway-restaurant-and-catering-nashville-2,5.0,96,"Washington, DC",Tamoghna B.
"900 Rosa L Parks BlvdNashville, TN 37208",4.0,I finally tried Jamaicaway at the Farmers Market a few weeks ago and can't figure out why it took me so long.When you come in you get in line and order from the people by the counter.  The food is out like a cafeteria line so you pick your meat and sides and they hand it to you.  Don't forget your tray and silverware or you'll have to push through the crowd and get it later.  Ooops.I tried the spicy jerk chicken with fried plantains and greens.  God I love greens and they were great.  the jerk chicken was spicy but not too spicy and was tasty.  Watch out though because there's some weird gristly/chewy parts in there.  Fried plantains were perfect - I don't get a lot of opportunities to eat plantains so I had to have them.  The Johnny cakes soaked up all the tasty sauce from the jerk chicken and made me full and stuffed.Good place to eat lunch when you are at the Farmers Market - just be prepared to be uber-stuffed and needing a nap afterwards!,Jamaicaway Restaurant & Catering,6152555920,1027 reviews,2012-01-20,"Nashville, TN",/biz/jamaicaway-restaurant-and-catering-nashville-2,4.0,96,"Washington, DC",Nickie G.

"900 Rosa L Parks BlvdNashville, TN 37208",4.0,"This is my favorite spot to have lunch in Nashville. First of all, the owners are of the nicest people I've ever met in my life. The wife is a former school teacher and always  finds something interesting to talk about. Even when the owners are gone, the other employees are fun too. They are all about having a good time and crank up the music while they work. Now for the important stuff! FOOD. Every time I visit, I always pour myself a giant glass of raspberry iced tea. It's almost a little too sweet, so I typically cut it with a tad I water (the sweetness adds to the charm though). My favorite dish here is the mild jerk chicken. So fresh and tender...it just melts in your mouth. This meat option pairs very nicely with collards, fried plantain (a must!) and a ""johnny cake"" (basically an unsweetened donut). This meal is so rich that you might pause midway and wonder if you should save the rest for later. Do not. Enjoy it while it's fresh and delicious. They also offer exciting other proteins like oxtail, goat (also delicious and happens to be the owners personal favorite), soy, and gluten. I've never tried oxtail.

"900 Rosa L Parks BlvdNashville, TN 37208",4.0,"I love Jamaican food. A little known fact about my hometown (Toronto) is that it has the 2nd biggest West Indian population outside of the West Indies next to Brooklyn, NY. I grew up around Jamaican food and culture.  Imagine my excitement when I found this joint at the farmers market!As far as Jamaican food goes this joint is spot on. It's a for real Jamaican joint after all. The jerk chicken, oxtail, curry goat, curry chicken (all with rice & peas and callaloo) are the dishes I generally go for with a jamaican beef patty on the side.  Go for the kola champagne or a bottle of ting an you'll be good to go.Another joy was the fact that they have roti, which is a West Indian flat bread like tortillas but in my opinion is way better. It's got crushed chick peas and is as good as it gets. As for the beef patties, they're good, but not as hot (spicy) as I like to have them, but being in Nashville with only one other West Indian joint, I won't complain.Tell the good dude Kamal that eyejammy says ""what up.""

"900 Rosa L Parks BlvdNashville, TN 37208",4.0,"Tucked away in the Farmer's Market, this place serves cheap, delicious Jamaican food.  By far their most popular item seems to be the chicken, which may come spicy, BBQ, or in jerk, curry brown sauce, or with mango chutney.  While the chicken dishes all seem to be chunks of chicken (with bone) immersed in their respective sauces, the meat is tender, and the sauces are deliciously thick, and strong, the brown sauce having a slight sweetness to it, while the spicy sauces have a fairly mild but respectable kick. Other dishes include a Tilapia escoveitch cooked while you wait that comes off quite tender and crumbly, if a little watery, and has a distinct sweet and sour-like sauce to it, as well as curried goat and ox-tails, which I have not gotten around to trying.  All dishes come two sides, which range from three varieties of rice (rice with beans, rice with peas, yellow rice) to fried plantains, various greens (from reallly bitter callaloo to thick turnip greens to green beans), and mashed or sweet potatoes.  A side dish of rice is nearly necessary to counteract the strong flavors of the chicken or fish.  All dishes also come with a choice of Johnny cake or corn bread, which also helps counteract the intense flavors. The Johnny cake comes nearly fresh out of the oven and is hot and crumbly like a very soft biscuit. With a drink, including various Caribbean sodas and  herbal fruit teas, it is just about $10-$15 for a good meal. The restaurant has somewhat odd hours, and is basically a glorified cafeteria. The staff however are friendly and helpful despite the bustle that surrounds them. Jamaicaway seems especially popular on Sundays after church and can get quite crowded at that point, though that is probably also the best time to visit.  Go early, like when it opens at around 11, to beat the crowds and get first dibs on the freshly made dishes.

"900 Rosa L Parks BlvdNashville, TN 37208",4.0,"Good fresh ""fast"" food.  Jamaicaway is laid out ""foot court style"", in that the hot dishes are presented behind glass and are scooped onto your plate right in front of you as you order it.  With the exception of what I ordered today, which was the Spicy Curry Gluten (as in wheat gluten, as in seitan).  It wasn't quite ready, so the man behind the counter told me he'd deliver my food to my table.  He did.  With the curry I had friend plantains and stewed almost Indian-like cabbage.  And a johnnycake, which I will explain later.Jamaicaway has an enticing selection of meat dishes (oxtail, goat, and chicken) with an additionally enticing variety of vegetarian dishes. (Tofu, gluten, etc.).  The price of an entree with two sides was a little under $9.  Pretty good.  Sides include but are not limited to plantains, cabbage, collard greens, sweet potato and pineapple, and different rice preparations.The johnnycake... I suppose I expected an American johnnycake, a pancake flap jack thing.  Was I wrong.. each meal was served with a johnnycake, a palm size piece of deep-fried, dense dough.  Woah.  I'm glad I tried it, but another may kill me.  Small, not a fantastic choice for a huge group of people.  Try Jamaicaway.  Especially if you are vegetarian, as you will appreciate the dishes that honestly do cater to you.",Jamaicaway Restaurant & Catering,6152555920,295 reviews,2009-05-10,"Nashville, TN",/biz/jamaicaway-restaurant-and-catering-nashville-2,4.0,96,"Washington, DC",Rachel S.

"900 Rosa L Parks BlvdNashville, TN 37208",4.0,"I really really want to like Jamaicaway, since my mother is from Trinidad so I grew up on many Caribbean staples that are pretty difficult to find anywhere else in Nashville. This is the only place where I can routinely get a goat curry wrapped in a roti or some oxtail, so for that reason alone, I'd probably give it a pass.But the problem with places that feature food that reminds me of my childhood is that I'm going to have a pretty high bar set and I can't honestly say that Jamaicaway is hitting that bar. While I appreciate how tender they get their goat, I sometimes feel like the spicing is off in the curry base, and if you're going to get the goat roti (which is essentially like a big burrito filled with goat curry), it would be nice to only have boneless meat in there, otherwise you are in for a nasty surprise. My other qualm is with the callalloo, which they make using turnip and other various greens, which is just not the way it's meant to be done. Callalloo is a plant that is very similar to spinach and while you can make it with other greens, it won't officially be callalloo in my book if you do so. Additionally, I hate that they use all the parts of the greens they do use, meaning that you get bunches of undigestible and unplatable fibrous bits that are a bit like chewing bamboo. Not pleasant at all.Also, I don't want to fault Jamaicaway on being successful, but I think it is fair to say that if you come during the lunch hour, this place will be busy and service will suffer for it. Even though it's cafeteria style, the line always seems to stall, especially as I always seem to wind up behind someone who is ordering 5 or 6 meals to go. I do find the hours pretty inconvenient as well, as this is yet another one of those Nashville restaurants that only seems to be open for lunch or an extremely early dinner. I also think that the food is a little bit pricey, personally. Maybe if their goat roti were the best I'd ever had I could see spending $11 on it, but I've had better for a fraction of that price. The portions are generous, but I generally find that I don't want to eat my entire meal because the flavor just doesn't have the proper refinement.I appreciate that Jamaicaway is filling a niche here in Nashville, and for that I give it some extra points, but whenever I go, I can't help but wish it were better. I guess that like authentic Chinese food, I'll just have to wait for the Caribbean flavors I know to make it to Nashville.",Jamaicaway Restaurant & Catering,6152555920,136 reviews,2011-04-25,"Toronto, Canada",/biz/jamaicaway-restaurant-and-catering-nashville-2,3.0,96,"Washington, DC",Steph H.

"395 Haywood LnNashville, TN 37211",4.5,"We woke up on a Sunday morning & decided to run a couple errands. We were craving Thai food so we thought about hitting up Thai Taste. We would be in the area & we always enjoyed it. I looked to see their hours, recently they'd have odd hours. I checked the website & found they'd actually closed about a year & a half ago! It looks like a new Thai place has opened up in it's place, Thai Ville. We decided to give it a try. We stopped in around noon on Sunday & there was one couple at a different table. Not very busy, but that didn't detour us, I mean it's only been open for about 4 months by my calculations. We were greeted warmly & sat at a table & our drink order was taken. If you'd been to Thai Taste, the interior will be very familiar. They haven't change much. It's a nicely appointed restaurant for the age of the building. As we skimmed the menu (all with pictures), the owner stopped by & introduced himself & told us what dishes were his favorite & how this food is different than the other Thai places in Nashville. We decided on the crab Rangoon as an appetizer, I ordered the Pad Kee Mao & Phillip ordered some kind of pork dish. They've got a lunch & dinner price. There's about two dollars in price difference on the items. I told the server I wanted the lunch portion, seeing as it was lunchtime & I wasn't wanting a huge plate of food. She told us that on the weekends is only dinner portions. I thought that was a little odd but I figured we be getting a huge plate of food. The crab Rangoon came soon after. You can really tell they care about presentation here. They use a lot of flowers carved out of carrots & other vegetables. The crab Rangoon was okay. The won tong paper was really thick so it was kind of hard to bite into. I like it when the paper is more delicate & inside crab stuff is fluffy. The food arrived after we were done with the crab Rangoon. The ""dinner"" portion we got looked more like a lunch portion. I think the lunch/dinner portion on the weekend is probably just to make a few extra bucks. The menu didn't have anything on it about no lunch options on the weekend, however on the website, the new menu says dinner is from 11am-9pm on Saturday & Sunday. I enjoyed the Pad Kee Mao. The noodles were cooked well & the chicken was seasoned. I asked for spicy but it wasn't very spicy so we got the 3 little containers of spices. The bell peppers were a little soft for me. Overall I enjoyed the meal. I would've liked the paper on the crab Rangoon to be a little lighter, & next time I'll come when it's actual lunchtime, during the week only.",Thai Ville Restaurant,6158349250,383 reviews,2015-07-21,"Nashville, TN",/biz/thai-ville-restaurant-nashville-2,3.0,19,"Washington, DC",Billy H.

"395 Haywood LnNashville, TN 37211",4.5,"My husband and I love Thai food, but don't love driving all the way across town to get to Smiling Elephant or Phooket Thai.  We couldn't wait to try Thai Ville when it opened just a few miles from our house, and we definitely weren't disappointed.  The staff is so friendly and attentive, making sure that you have absolutely everything you need.   The food was really excellent, and super fresh- the vegetables and herbs taste like they were just picked fresh from the garden.  I don't like a lot of spice myself, but my husband says it's legit.  The portions are generous, but I hope one day we'll have enough room to try the delicious sounding desserts.  Can't say enough good things about this place- give it a try!",Thai Ville Restaurant,6158349250,1 review,2015-07-16,"Nashville, TN",/biz/thai-ville-restaurant-nashville-2,5.0,19,"Washington, DC",Robin H.
"395 Haywood LnNashville, TN 37211",4.5,"Dinner prices at 2pm? That's what they charged me for Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mao). I much prefer the Pad Kee Mao at Thai Phooket, more saucy and veggie. This seemed like just soy sauce and hot sauce, with mostly just green beans for veggies -- and it's a small portion. I had tofu as the meat, and they used those pre-fab tofu cubes that I don't like as much as actual slices of fried tofu. I asked for medium hot and it was just perfect for my taste, but probably too hot if you're not used to Thai food.

"395 Haywood LnNashville, TN 37211",4.5,"I have never had an experience of a meal quite like this. From the family's unique charm, to their food's authentic taste, it was an amazing meal. First I will focus on the food's native flair. I had two companions with me. One of my companions had the garden salad, with a orange and pineapple dressing, and the other had the beef tiger-tear salad. They were very satisfied from all I could tell. For our main courses, I had the pad Thai, it was the best pad Thai I had ever had. My associates had both the panaing curry, a creamy and spicy dish served with chicken and rice, and the Pad Se Ew a dish served with vegetables and brown noodles. All of this seemed to please them. The family was very friendly, our server, who was one of the two sisters, was one of the most friendly people I have ever met. She helped us with all of our decisions. From the call we made, we knew that they would have southern hospitality with another country's love towards foreigners. All in all, whether this is an introduction to Thai food, or you are a seasoned veteran towards the scrumptious tastes of Thai food, this is an amazing meal!

"395 Haywood LnNashville, TN 37211",4.5,"For the last several years, my wife and I would visit this location when it was called Thai Taste. We liked the location as it was close to our home and the food was always good. The problem was Thai Taste would often be closed and never seemed to keep steady hours and then it closed. We were very happy to see that new owners took over the location. It is now called Thai Ville and we recently visited the new restaurant. We were greeted by a very polite server who told us about his family moving here from Bangkok and how long they had been open. From the first bite, we knew we had found a winner. We ordered a variety of dishes to try as many items as we could. We started with Thai tea and it was creamy and the tea flavor was perfect. Sometimes the Thai tea can be harsh or taste too strong. This was excellent. I ordered Tom Yum with shrimp and my wife ordered Miso Soup. The Tom Yum broth was so flavorful and rich. I can't remember a better experience with Tom Yum. It's usually either too spicy hot or too salty but this was just perfect. The Miso was also very rich and perfectly seasoned. I ordered Chicken Satay and they generous portion was cooked exactly how I like it and the peanut sauce was excellent. The peanut sauce had to be homemade. My wife ordered tiger tears salad and it was very flavorful the seasoning was a great combination of sweet and savory. I ordered Red Curry with shrimp. Red Curry is one of my go-to's at Thai restaurants so I've had many. The curry in this one was so amazing that I found myself desperately trying to get the last drop of the curry out of the serving bowl. Chalk it up to a very good chef, very fresh and top notch ingredients and wonderful service, but I think I've found my new Thai restaurant in Nashville. I can't give Thai Ville enough stars.

"1100 Fatherland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"The food at Local Taco was a bright spot in my recent trip to Nashville.  The service had some issues, but they were pretty busy, and I've only been there once, so I can't really ding them for that. Issues included getting an extra ear of corn that hadn't been ordered (they took it back and I don't think we were charged), flour tortillas instead of the requested corn, and just plain slow service. The bright spots of the service were friendly demeanor, and that they were willing to split our check for us.They have a great variety of tacos on the menu - I was really craving chicken so I went with 3 chicken. My 3 companions tried almost every variety in total.  I had a bite of the Korean inspired, it was delicious. Because I prefer my tacos to free of dairy products I tend to rely on either salsa or well seasoned meat to get great flavor. These met that requirement well!We split a pitcher of margaritas, which allowed each of us one margarita plus a little bit of refill for the faster drinkers. They were tasty, but pretty darn sweet.  If I go again (I live across the country) I'd request less sweetener. It can be pretty crowded inside. We were able to get an easily wheelchair accessible table, but I could see it being difficult to ever access the outdoor seating unless it was super dead inside (no architectural barriers from what I saw, just furniture & bodies in the way). I didn't make it to the restroom to check out access there.  Along one wall there are booths for those who prefer booths over tables.",Local Taco,6154546892,220 reviews,2015-05-13,"Seattle, WA",/biz/local-taco-nashville-2,4.0,55,"Washington, DC",Julie G.
"1100 Fatherland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"the entrance was a bit weird.. no one greeted me and then asked if i needed something.. .not if they could help me find a seat. i ordered the one of their top salads and was marked GF (Gluten Free) but when I told them that I needed it GF and to ensure their was no dairy, they all seemed confused. Thankfully another waitress stepped in and told them that I couldn't have the dressing. My first salad came out work (cheese all over the top even though that isn't on the menu), but they were quick to correct it. The issue with the corrected salad is that they gave me a half portion of lettuce. This place is fine if you don't have other options or if you want a Mexican dinner that is light tasting, but the hospitality and knowledge is lacking with the staff.

The Korean bbq tacos are delish.The second time I went in at lunch. The hostess was on the phone and completely ignored me. There was no one else to ask so I quietly said ""should I seat myself?"". Nodded without looking at me. I sat down and waited for about 15 min until someone else came in and ordered at the front.

"1100 Fatherland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Not sure why this place is so well reviewed.At first, I was pleased with the welcoming decor and open air on a nice spring night, though many of their vintage rolling desk chairs are uncomfortable and rickety.The skinny margarita was good and decently priced, but they forgot to salt the rim. The skinny margarita here is a classic margarita: tequila, fresh lime, and agave nectar. This was the only win. The chips and queso were fine, well portioned and met expectations but nothing special.The tacos, though, were so disappointing, uninspired and bland. The grilled steak with horseradish crema was a huge miss. The steak was cold and seemed like it had been sitting for hours. Overall, the flavors just didn't make sense. Their signature ""bang bang"" sauce was a vinegary excuse for a habanero add on to my spicy shrimp taco, which consisted of four tiny, fried popcorn shrimp.All of this mediocrity was rounded out by a MIA, space cadet server, who ultimately rounded down the score from an average 3 to a below average 2.

We figured, hey, a 5K totally would compensate for baskets of chips, guac and tacos right? And so it began.We got the trio of sauces that included this black bean corn mix, salsa, and salsa verde. Loved the black bean mix, although you don't get very much. The taco selection was quite extensive including Korean rib tacos, which I ordered. I was disappointed as I felt for almost $4, they should of had more filling. Alongside with my taco, I ordered the Southwest salad with chicken. It was fantastic! Beautifully put together and a sizable portion (~$9). Service wise, I thought they did a great job. I would give them 5 stars for that!

I have had the fish, shrimp, and fried avocado tacos, the fried mac & cheese, the street corn, and different salsas with the chips. Everything has been consistently awesome for us. Mine and my husband's favorite is the fried avocado taco with added boom boom sauce. He doesn't even really like avocado and he thinks it it awesome. The fish taco was my least favorite (this is usually my favorite food, period) but it was still good. I prefer grilled or lightly panko breaded and this was battered fish.

I would not, however, sit at the bar and be waited on by the disgruntled bartender in the tiny t-shirt. He walked away as he was asking us which type of salsa we wanted. He stood at the computer to take our order so we had to shout and we still had to repeat, as the noise level here is just a touch elevated. Writing it down when he was standing 3 feet closer would have been much more efficient and polite. He never smiled. Once. At first I thought it was perhaps because we were only drinking non-alcoholic beverages. (There was a wait for a table and the bar wasn't even half full, that's the story there). But it wasn't a grudge against us, as I watched him. His demeanor never changed with any of the guests he waited on. Hopefully he was just having an off-night.

"1100 Fatherland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I have been addicted to Local Taco since Summer of 2012. I recently bought a house in East Nashville and had been driving all the way to Sylvan Park to get my fix. Then, one day, I passed Local Taco in East Nashville and could hardly contain my excitement. I was a little confused by the whole ordering process at first. In Sylvan Park they take your order right at the door. Once I was given a menu I realized why it was a little different. The menu is much larger, plus they have breakfast tacos! This just made me even more excited. I did my usual 2 fish tacos with bang bang sauce and then tried a salmon taco. My partner had a steak taco, fish taco and fried chicken taco. They were all great! Literally, I have never tasted a better taco in the 24 years of my taco eating experience. Both locations are amazing, but East Nashville wins out due to the updated decor and larger menu.

"1100 Fatherland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"My husband and I had one dinner in Nashville, and were very pleased that this was it. I got fried avocado tacos, and he got the local BBQ - both were wonderful. If you're getting sides, you MUST get the Mac and cheese, it's fried into a patty, like nothing you've ever seen, and was soooo good. The Mac and cheese comes with tiny cups of salsa verde and queso too, which made a great addition to our order of chips and salsa. That's right, chips and salsa don't come free, and honestly, their salsas leave much to be desired. The red salsa is a thick paste of chipotle, and the pico de gallo was bland... The lackluster salsas were the only drawback to the meal. This chips themselves were delish! Also, it was margarita Monday the day we went, and the house margaritas were $4. Not sure if it happens every Monday, but it should.

"1100 Fatherland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"OMG! ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!! I went in for the first time, around 20 minutes before they closed. I felt bad about that, but I was treated very nice anyways. I was expecting the regular type of tacos. I asked for the classic 'beef and cheese' and they didn't do that.  I was a little disappointed about that. BUT - little did I know, I was about to have one of THE BEST eating experiences. I am a very picky eater, so the bartender let me have them made however I wanted. I got 3 of the Fried chicken, added cheese and got the INCREDIBLE lime sauce on the side, since I wasn't sure if I'd like it or not. Then, I got 3 of the pulled pork, with BBQ sauce, added cheese. I also got a lemonade. My total was $26.76. I thought that was really expensive... But thought, it had to be good for that price. So, I open up the box and dug in. Took my first bite of the BBQ pulled pork and I was almost in shock how delicious this was. I couldn't tell you how many times I made the - ""mmmmm"" noise. I'm not even kidding. The meat was definitely high quality, no doubt! It was juicy, tender, everything about it was good. I then tried the fried chicken, I put a little bit of the lime sauce on, took a bite, WOW. ""mmmmm"" I ate two of the chicken tacos and one of the pork tacos. I REALLY wanted more of the pork, but half of the order was for my special friend. That REALLY felt like a sacrifice! Lol. Not even kidding. I picked him up from work and started handing him tacos as he was driving. His reaction was the EXACT same as mine! It was so funny. He did the whole ""mmmmm"" thing serveral times while stuffing his face, just how I did. He said a couple times how fantastic it was. AND the tacos weren't even that warm by the time I feed him and it was STILL delicious. I don't understand how some of these people on here have left bad reviews. I am born and raised from Nashville, TN - and The Local Taco is definitely in my top 5 of places to eat....and I've eaten pretty much EVERYWHERE here in Nashville. Who would have ever thought, A TACO PLACE?!?! My review may be over the top here, but I am by no means over-exaggerating! I mean what I say and I'm all about high quality food. This place is 5 stars.

I could understand slow service if the place was slammed...but it's never been while we've been there so I'm not sure what the problem is. Do they not have enough kitchen staff...is the kitchen too small/not equipped to handle the restaurant size...do the servers consistently forget to put the orders in? Frustrating!

We are always greeted within minutes with chips and salsa. Our server is always pleasant and accommodating. Tonight, we had a group of 5. Four adults and one child. When we arrived, we were sat within 15 minutes of requesting a table. We were one short of our group, so waiting to be greeted was not an issue. About 7-8 minutes after being sat, our server Justin L greeted us. He seemed pleasant and upbeat, very nice, and very happy. After bringing us our drinks, he proceeded to take our orders. We went around ordering our meals with a few modifications. He then repeated the order back to us, and when he got to mine I noticed he misheard what I had said. No problem, I corrected him and he placed our order.Food came out quickly and he served us all our meals. My food was placed in front of me and it was not what I ordered... I was kind of shocked because I had already corrected him one time and couldn't believe he had somehow got mixed up again but no big deal. He noticed and took it back immediately. The others had started eating and another person in our group had ordered a modified quesadilla (no chicken)... it was loaded with chicken. She was irritated, but picked the chicken out of the quesadilla no problem.Because my food was taking so long to remake, Justin apologized and told me we would be getting a dessert on the house and the meal would be taken off the check. I thanked him, we then asked for sour cream while we waited for my meal. He forgot. We asked for chips while I waited, he forgot. Finally when my food had come out, it was on point. Perfectly prepared, delicious. BOH did a great job. We asked for our sour cream and chips (for a third time) he finally brought it out. By the end of our meal. We were pretty irritated with Justin. We asked for our checks and told him who was on what check.

"163B Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"After being told that there was a 2 hour wait on a Sunday night at the Mexican restaurant in the Opryland resort, we decided to venture out. We wanted Mexican, so Chuy's was a close option. The wait was only 10 minutes and we were seated. We were brought chips and salsa, plus a creamy sauce that we were told was their house made creamy jalapeño sauce. The chips were excellent and that creamy sauce was amazing! We all preferred it to salsa. Our chips and sauce were refilled multiple times over the course of the meal and two of us even used that sauce as an extra flavor on our meals. The menu is large and it was easy for me to find something as a vegetarian. I ordered the tex-mex salad combo, which included a large dinner salad and a choice of several smaller menu items. I chose a mini- burrito, which was not mini at all, but was compared to their menu burrito (12"" long!). I got the bean and cheese, and it came with my choice of sauce over it - I got queso. Our food came out quickly and we dug in. It was yummy! Homemade sauces, fresh ingredient, and flavorful. My burrito was maybe a bit too heavy on the salt but still good. The salad was fresh and the dressing was great. Adding some of that jalapeno sauce to both enhanced the flavors too. My dining companions ordered a steak burrito and fajitas, and both loved them. The portions were too big for any of us to finish... or maybe that was the 3 baskets of chips we consumed. But I digress..So we came back for a happy hour. Their happy hour rocks. House margaritas for $4.25, and a free nacho bar. The nacho bar has their yummy queso, salsa, jalapeno sauce and ground beef. All with unlimited chips. It was like a meal. Price for 4 alcoholic drinks and 1 virgin drink was $23. We were staying at the Opryland resort, where it cost $26 at a bar for one wine and one cocktail. After happy hour we shopped at the mall, had drinks at another bar nearby, and then went to another place for dinner... where we were ignored for 15 minutes. So we walked out and came back to Chuy's for dinner. It was delicious again. 3 days... 3 visits.

"163B Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,Almost all the food was really good way better than a lot of Mexican places.PROS:the chips were the best chips I have ever had. Light crispy salty goodness.the taco salad with sirloin ground beef and fresh fresh veggies was very good. The shell at the top was chewy but the bottom of the shell was really good. The chili relenos with ground beef and cheese where the best I have ate. The light crispy coating was way better than the usally heavy breading ate almost all places. The charro beans were awesome get them instead of the refried beans which are average at best.CONS:The chicken inside enchiladas etc was very bland and boring... stick with the beef or shrimp.The salsa was very very lime like. It was fresh but overly tangy.The refried beans are so average I am saying it twice get the charro beans.The resturant itself had a fun relaxed vibe even when busy. I dont even like chain resturants but this is one that makes things fresh and does it right. I am not a huge fan of the same ol same ol mexican food. This place I truely enjoyed. I would give it a 4.5 but it earned the 5.,Chuy’s,6156862035,141 reviews,2015-08-03,"Madison, TN",/biz/chuys-nashville-3,5.0,131,"Washington, DC",Dagan B.

"163B Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Meh...Being from Southern California, I know good Mexican food.  Not only was the food so-so, the margarita I had was nearly all water... No flavor at all.  Luckily I had salt on the rim to help.  I would recommend beer... it can't be messed up.The chicken quesadilla was four individual flour tortillas (different is okay) with cheese and chicken.  Luckily, I added items from the salsa bar to help, but I still wouldn't finish this food; not good.Mexican food needs spices and cocktails need flavor... less ice perhaps.The bar area is ""seat yourself,"" but so small, I'm sure no more than 30 people would be needed to breach the occupancy limit.Location is convenient to the Mall and Opry.I won't return to Chuy's while there are so many great places to eat in/around Nashville.",Chuy’s,6156862035,101 reviews,2015-05-31,"San Diego, CA",/biz/chuys-nashville-3,2.0,131,"Washington, DC",Fun C.

Our waitress was extremely good, as well. We only had about a 5 minute wait before sitting at a table, and the manager came to thank us veterans/ active duty/ retired military for our service. If you are active duty or retired, your meal (only your meal) is 50% off if you have an ID. Now that was a pleasant surprise and goes to show what kind of appreciation the business has for our military, which I will support any day!

"163B Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,I was a little disappointed in the service at Chuys today.  I won't pass judgement on today's experience but it still calls for a mention.   Food a+ drinks a+ service by Pete F.  Sad that I brought out of town friends and raved about hospitality only to be served by someone who didn't see it to serve someone of a different color.  I've seen the racism in the south - but being from NY I refuse to think it's really that way.  Sad to say after a year I experienced it.  Great place to have great food - next time I will just stay away from Pete.,Chuy’s,6156862035,17 reviews,2015-07-26,"Bronx, NY",/biz/chuys-nashville-3,3.0,131,"Washington, DC",Maria S.

"163B Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Im honestly not a fan of Chuys and even with the convince factor of being at the mall, I avoid it at all costs. First it's a bad version of Americanized mexican food. Second their margaritas are always filled with too much ice and become water (even if you ask for little ice). Third it always seems dirty and sloppy. I have been to the bar side and table side and both times the table/counter was sticky and you needed new silverware because something was caked on.

I am currently living close to Nashville, TN and when I get homesick for Texas I eat at this location. The staff is always really cool and friendly and the food is every bit as good as the locations in Austin. They have fantastic(strong) Margaritas! Happy Hour is amazing and they offer corn tortillas which is great for people like me who can't eat gluten. Their special jalapeño cream sauce is pretty addicting.*My Chuy's favorites are:Texas Martini,Tortilla Soup. Chuychanga, steak fajitas, Chilli Rellenos and the Elvis plate is so good, but it can probably feed 2 people. When I was in volleyball as a teenager I could eat all of it, but not anymore.The one con I have about this location is how crowded it is. It's attached to Opry Mills Mall and if you hit this place at the wrong time it can be a super long wait. Suggestion is to call ahead and see how long the wait is to prepare yourself or eat at an off time when it is less crowded.

Don't worry, beer helps that considerably.For my entree, I went with the Seasoned Ground Sirloin Chile Relleno. The menu says it comes with Ranchero Sauce, but our waiter strangely asked what sauce I wanted, so I picked the Creamy Jalapeno for some added spice. Of my rice options, I opted for the Green Chile Rice, to which the waiter replied, ""Spicy Rice?"" Uh, if those are the same thing, then yes. I also got refried beans with this order. After all of that, I had no confidence whatsoever in what would actually come out of the kitchen. Surprisingly, everything was correct.The beans were nice and mushy, but didn't really have much flavor. The rice was decently spicy. Although it looked a bit dry, it was actually quite nice. My chile relleno had a really good batter. The thick pepper had a nice flavor to it, and the creamy jalapeno ranch was a nice addition.

The rice and beans that are served with the tacos were good, pretty much like you would have at most Mexican restaurants. I always get excited when I find a place that makes ""real"" mojitos. I'm talking where the bartender has to put a little elbow grease into making it. Well, Chuy's mojitos are just that. If you like your mojitos sweet then you'll enjoy theirs.

"163B Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Far exceeded expectations.Was staying at the Gaylord Opryland Hotel and after dining at Cascades, supposedly their best restaurant onsite, knew we had to venture out for dinner. Chuy's was not only recommended by some of the Opryland staffers, but also was the top rated place within walking distance on Yelp. 3.5 stars didn't sound terrible, but going to Tex_mex in Tennessee seemed a little odd. Nonetheless we checked out Opry Hills Mall and two-stepped our way into Chuy's.4PM-7PM every weekday is their Happy Hour. Beyond a few drink specials, including their signature Margarita's and the Texas Martini (a Margarita served in a shaker bottle with a Martini glass garnished with jalapeño stuffed olives and a wedge of lime), the happy hour also includes unlimited house made tortilla chips, queso (nacho cheese sauce), seasoned beef, and their new creamy jalapeño sauce. After ordering drinks and loading up our nachos, we we're already pretty satisfied, and opted to share the waiter-recommended chicken fajitas. Served on a hot skillet with all the toppings you'd imagine (including guac) they were incredible. Not only was the chicken perfectly cooked, but the home made tortillas make a huge difference in overall taste.The ambiance is a step up from other casual restaurants in the same price range. Unlike an Applebees, Chili's, etc, most of the art inside Chuy's is handmade like the food. We skipped on dessert, but overall had an incredible experience. I know a big part of our satisfaction, was due to the gentleman who was serving us. When we ran out of fajita tortillas he even brought us a few extra for the last few pieces of chicken we had. I'm looking forward to my trip to Austin so I can visit the original.Pro-tips:-Go during 4PM-7PM Weekday Happy Hour-Try the Texas Martini-Portions are large",Chuy’s,6156862035,116 reviews,2014-08-09,"Manhattan, NY",/biz/chuys-nashville-3,5.0,131,"Washington, DC",Armand K.

Reasonable prices + big portions = strong value. My son had soft tacos, which were a bit spicy for him (fine to me), and I had the ""Southwestern"" which is ""a New Mexican tradition. Homemade blue corn tortillas stacked with freshly-roasted, hand-pulled chicken, cheese & Green Chile sauce, topped with a fried egg""; I really enjoyed it.The ceiling of the room we were in was covered in wheel covers/hubcaps; the rest of the place was similarly adorned.

Don't get me wrong, I don't think it will disappoint if you are looking for the good tex-mex staples at a good price. One thing you should definately try is their side sauces. I think most don't realize you can get them with your meal or chips for free and it adds alot of flavor to the meal. Definately better than only having salsa. They have them on a side fold out on the menu.Not sure about the other locations but if it is anywhere near mealtime plan on this place being packed.

Makes me happy that Blue Coast won't be my only resort lol.

"163B Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Not sure how anyone can be passionate about this restaurant on the good side or the bad side.  It is your typical chain Tex-Mex experience on the above average side.  Not sure if they are trying to be Tex-Mex or authentic.  The website says recipes come from South Texas, New Mexico, and border towns.  Then it makes mention of ""authentic Mexican food at a great price."" Que eres,  chiche or limonada?I arrived at the Opry Mills location at 11:45 on a Friday.  There was already a wait for  a table.  Fortunately for me, (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it) I was dining alone so I sat myself at the bar.  The bartender attended to me promptly.  I ordered the Friday special which is Hatch Green Chile Chicken Enchiladas.  He brought out a basket full of chips and salsa.  The chips are really good as they are fresh and paper thin.  Salsa is also good as it is heavy on the lime and chunky.  It needs a little more heat but once again I have to tell myself - this is a Tex-Mex chain not Nolensville Rd.The enchiladas came after about 10 - 15 minutes.  They were piping hot and it was a generous portion.  Flavor was good with a reasonable amount of white breast meat.  My only gripe was that the only presence of Hatch Green Chiles was two 4 inch long threads about as wide as a shoe lace.  The dish would have been much better with about 5 times the amount of chiles.I have tried to eat dinner at the Cool Springs location only to be turned off by the incredible long waits.  The food is good, not great.  I certainly would not wait 30+ minutes for a table unless someone else was picking up my margarita tab!",Chuy’s,6156862035,77 reviews,2012-10-12,"Brentwood, TN",/biz/chuys-nashville-3,3.0,131,"Washington, DC",Bret D.

"163B Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"We went on a Friday night, and it was CROWDED because the mall has just re-opened. It was a 2 hour wait, but we asked, and they serve full menu at the main and outdoor bars, so we just went and made some room for ourselves in the outside portion of the bar. If you aren't in a large party, and you don't have kids with you, then sitting at the bar is a great way to bypass a long, long wait.We had our food in less than 20 minutes after ordering. I've been to Chuy's before, and am pretty satisfied with the general spiciness (pretty spicy) and the flavors they bring to their food. From the chips and salsa to the enchiladas, they make it all in house, and it tastes really good. If you have dietary restrictions (vegan/no dairy/gluten free) they seem pretty willing to work for you. They will fry up your own serving of chips in a separate pan of oil just to make sure no wheat flour gets into them if you ask. They will make a separate batch of meat without the gluten/dairy containing seasoning they would otherwise use.Ask for a bowl of creamy jalapeno sauce when they bring out the chips and salsa. It is free and it is wonderful. Not at all low-fat, though. My only criticism about the food is that they don't really do enough to differentiate the menu items. You would be hard pressed to identify all of the sauces they put on a typical plate, and they can start to run together. We have talked with a manager a couple of times, and feel confident in their food prep ethics. They were out of shredded chicken, and it was going to be a couple of hours to get some more ready...because it takes a couple of hours to cut up a chicken, cook it, take it off the bone, shred it, and then cook it again. I would much rather eat that kind of food.The guy who said ""Taco Bell is better most times"" has apparently not been to Taco Bell recently (since the `80s?). Or maybe has a personal beef against Chuy's for some unstated reason. It's certainly not 1-star food. I got a large plate of food, and it had zero fried items (other than the fresh chips I was eating at the time). Yes, there are more authentic (and honestly, better) Mexican restaurants on Nolensville Rd. If we're going to compare everyone to La Hacienda, though, everyone is going to lose. Last time I was at THAT restaurant, a handful of cars were broken into in the seedy back alley you have to park in if you want the real deal.

During happy hour, they set up a nice little Nacho Car station in the bar area and you're free to help yourself to as much chips, salsa, and queso as you want. They even had refried beans and ground sirloin up there as well so you could add it to the queso if you felt inclined. I thought this was pretty awesome.

This is our new favorite restaurant for date night, yes it's different from your traditional mexican but it's AMAZING, try this place and you won't be dissapointed. Chipotle chicken enchiladas, or chicka chicka boom boom are my favorite, and ""Big as your face"" burrito is my hubby's favorite! The price range is about $8-$10/entree depending on what you get, check for the daily specials too:)",Chuy’s,6156862035,5 reviews,2012-12-04,"Lebanon, TN",/biz/chuys-nashville-3,5.0,131,"Washington, DC",Meleah J.

"163B Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"After hearing and reading such great things about this restaurant, I was very disappointed in our experience. It was later on a Sunday night, so we were seated right away, but no one came to our table for about 15 minutes. When someone finally did come, she didn't apologize for our wait or anything. She just asked ""Has (insert name here) seen you yet?"" When we said no, she says ""ugh. Well I guess I'll take you."" You could tell she didn't want to do it. We put our drink orders in...me a mojito, my husband a margarita. They were nothing special. I dare say my 6-year-old niece could have made me a better mojito. We ordered guac to go with our chips. Again, nothing fantastic, but not terrible either. Then came our food. My husband ordered the #2 and I ordered the #9. My advice....don't. It's not worth it. Our food was just plain nasty. Everything tasted as though it had been sitting out for a day or two. I'm going to copy part of someone else's review and say that Taco Bell would have been better.

We were seated after waiting for only 15 minutes! Had a crappy waitress. She took our drink order (two waters, simple enough!) and came back a little later to take our food order, still no drinks and didn't seem to notice. Salsa tasted freshly made and had slight heat that didn't linger - I really liked it. She gave a table next to us their drinks and took their food order, then I had to ask her for our waters (not sure how long we waited, but it was definitely too long). Food came out soon after. I ordered the Chuychanga with Mexican rice, tomatillo sauce, and refried beans. It was all super delicious, but I was starving. Waitress checked on us once after our food was served.

"265 White Bridge PikeNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"I stumbled into Siam Cuisine to meet my grandparentals around noon. I'd woken up late (20 minutes prior), was about to eat Thai food for breakfast, and was not feeling enthusiastic about it.Boy did they show me.I dove right in ordered the red curry seafood and glass noodles... little did I know, it was a four course meal. We started with a simple brothy soup, then moved on to a gingery iceberg salad. Eh. Typical.When my curry arrived, it was wrapped in tin foil, which they glamorously cut open at our table using a pair of kitchen scissors. Inside was bubbling sauce, shrimp, squid, mussels and glass noodles. They also brought a huge plate of steamed rice, which I wanted them to take back, but the g-parents said to leave it. Why, God. After I demolished the entire thing, there was curry sauce left (and it was the best curry I've ever had), so I ended up dumping all of the rice in it and finishing that, too. I f*ckin' hate it when they bring rice and noodles... I CAN'T BE TRUSTED WITH THAT SORT OF RESPONSIBILITY. Regardless of my lack of self control, everything was absolutely delicious. Then, when I was on the verge of not-so-spontaneously combusting, they brought out dessert. Five adorable little egg rolls filled with steaming plantain, drizzled with honey and sesame seeds. They were too cute to resist. I mean, who's not a sucker for fried banana baby egg rolls? My indulgence cost me $17 bucks and a small amount of rice-induced guilt, but I'll be back for sure.

"265 White Bridge PikeNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"Having heard about this place for years, I finally decided to try it on Friday evening. The service was very good; my waitress was attentive, helpful and friendly. The appetizer I tried, crab rolls served with a chili oil, was really awful. This appetizer is a paste made up of pureed crab and tofu, wrapped in a wonton skin and fried. The first one was okay, then the second included a crunchy bit of crab shell surprise. Yuck. The texture was pretty off-putting, the shell bit revolting and the taste was bland and slightly unpleasant.  My entree, a massaman curry, was much better. The waitress asked me if I wanted extra vegetables, which was thoughtful and really improved the dish. The curry was rich and creamy and the medium spice level was just right. The vegetables were fresh and tasty, although the potato in it was overly crisp. Ultimately, this place was fine. My bill seemed a little high for 1 person, but not crazy. They do offer a lot of clearly marked vegetarian options and have an adequate beer and wine selection.",Siam Cuisine,6153540082,292 reviews,2012-02-12,"Kansas City, MO",/biz/siam-cuisine-nashville,3.0,71,"Washington, DC",Faith B.

"265 White Bridge PikeNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"With our usual Thai restaurant going down hill with each visit, it was time to seek out somewhere new to satisfy my Pad Thai craving.We've been several times for dinner and usually start out with the pan-fried dumplings.

On my last visit I went outside my usual ordering box and had the Massaman Curry (mild, because I'm wimpy) and it was also delicious. The only problem here comes on the service side. Its not that the service isn't good, the servers have always been friendly and someone is running around filling drinks. On really busy nights they often have only 1 or 2 servers so you'll be sitting around for a while before or after your meal.

And after a forbidden romp through the yarn store next door, I came in for lunch recently.I've never been a fan of Thai-style curries and soups.  I wasn't in the mood for pad thai or satay. So, I had a Chinese-based dish, their sweet and sour pork. It was just okay. The flavor combinations just weren't working for me. And I don't know if there was supposed to be any spice -- I didn't detect any.Their starter soup was interesting. It almost reminded me of Filipino-style tamarind soup, but not as sour. It was pleasantly mild to my tastes.And the spring roll that comes with the lunch was not memorable. But then, I grew up with Filipino lumpia.The Thai iced coffee was excellent and buzzed me for a few hours afterwards, in addition to giving me brain freeze.I think this may be the first Thai restaurant I've been to in which some of the staff are Americanized.

"265 White Bridge PikeNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"Lots of people complain about the lack of decent Chinese food in Nashville. I have frequently added my own voice to the mix, but I do think the same concern could also be voiced about Thai food in this town. Yes, there are quite a few places claiming to serve Thai food, but most of them have pretty much the exact same menus and the authenticity of the food is questionable. Even worse, most of the Thai places in town charge an arm and a leg so dinner for two is generally going to cost you.I am not sure that Siam Cuisine really does anything to address any of the above concerns, but I'd still call this one of my top Nashville Thai places because by and large, the food is really quite tasty. I wish that dining here didn't so often set my husband and I back about $50 when we eat in (due to the cost of drinks + tip on top of our food), but the end result is simply that we don't eat here nearly as often as we otherwise would. I think a large reason why the prices here are high is because we often like to order dishes off their ""Specialty"" section (in particular, we love the crispy duck, duck curry, and the kang curry gai, the latter being a mild curry that I've never found anywhere else and that has a broth that is pure ambrosia!) which tend to be pricier because all of the dishes in this section are served with soup, salad, and a dessert. A lot of time I wish they'd knock $3-4 off the pricetag and just serve me the main dish. I guess I should ask if it's possible for them to do so, but it seems a shame they don't have some easy pricing in their menu that does that already.As for the food itself, it's generally decent, while some of it is very good. The curries are creamy and rich, and the duck is some of the best preparation I've ever had! The real flops are the free soup that comes with your meal, that may not come from a can, but is so generic and blah it might as well. I also really love Tom Kha Gai, and I recently ordered a big bowl of it for my dinner alone. The serving was huge (I got enough for two meals!), but unfortunately the flavors weren't there. TKG is so amazingly flavorful, but what I was served had no zing or zip and was instead pretty bland, and I don't even want to talk about the mangy pieces of chicken in it. So if you're a soup lover, maybe go elsewhere.Overall, this isn't going to be the best Thai food you ever eat, but the food is generally very good and the waitstaff is courteous and effective. The atmosphere has always been pretty chill and quiet whenever I've been, but I'd imagine this place is pretty busy at lunch. Calls for pick-up are fast too, as I generally only have to wait 15 - 20 minutes after placing my order before my food is ready.

This time, the spring rolls were mediocre and the Pad See Ew tasted as if it had sat underneath the heat lamp for a bit.  That being said, Siam Cuisine is generally very consistent in quality and it could have been related to us coming late in the lunch crowd.

"265 White Bridge PikeNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"This is a case where I wish Yelp allowed half stars.  I would give Siam 3 and a half.  But, four will have to do!  As far as atmosphere goes, this is a lower-scale Thai place--but it's clean and that is a lot more than I can say about some other Thai places in town!  I will say, a friend and I went on a particularly warm weeknight--when we walked in, we noticed it was pretty warm in there.  To their credit, the hostess ran over and explained that the air wasn't working (they did have fans all over though) and said she understood if we wanted to come back and eat another day.  But, we REALLY wanted Thai, so we braved the heat.  Wasn't all that bad!  Service was decent--a little slow here and there, but despite no air conditioning, the place was packed so our server was pretty busy.  Now to the food.  I think it's great!  I had a chicken/garlic chili sauce/mushroom dish with white rice that was amazing.  Can't remember the name of it unfortunately.  I couldn't even pronounce it when I was there--I just had to point to the menu.  The dinner portions are big too--I was able to take half with me for lunch the next day.  My friend ordered a veggie dish, and was very pleased with hers as well.  I've eaten here for lunch before too--talk about a deal, you get an entree plus a spring roll and soup for about $8!  Dinner is just a tad more pricey but not much.  With two glasses of wine and dinner, I was out of there for just under $20.I don't get to Siam as often as I would like, but I'm going to make more of an effort to do so--for the price, the food is fabulous!",Siam Cuisine,6153540082,374 reviews,2008-06-16,"Nashville, TN",/biz/siam-cuisine-nashville,4.0,71,"Washington, DC",Robin S.

"265 White Bridge PikeNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"I've loved Thai food almost everywhere I've had it. Maybe my expectations were just too high, but Siam Cuisine disappointed in just about every way. Parking was a bitch, the front lot is very tight and was packed at lunchtime. Getting in and out of the back lot is one-way and inconvenient. We nearly got into an accident getting out because someone wasn't looking when they tried to get in.We were seated promptly in a very dim atmosphere. I always get edgy if a place is too dark. Do they not want us to see our food? Our order was taken relatively quickly, and then it was a lot of waiting. The soup had a pleasant, if mild,  vegetable stock, but the veggies were overcooked and the chicken tasteless.More waiting later, and our ""Native Thai hot"" curries arrived. Tthe vegetables were so overcooked as to be nearly tasteless. I've had crisper out of a can. To their credit, the scallops were perfectly textured, but that's not enough to make me go back. There was no heat to the dish whatsoever. If I took a mouthful with basil on it, I got some flavor, but nothing near what I've had in a multitude of places. I shudder to think what I would have tasted if I'd ordered ""mild.""  The spring roll was nothing special, not detracting from the meal, but not adding to it either.

"265 White Bridge PikeNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"I love Thai food and though Nashville doesn't offer the best assortment of it I think Siam Cuisine is actually a pretty good deal. Let me start by saying that having spent 3 weeks in Thailand I'm a total Pad Thai snob so I won't say that Siam's is great but it's a good enough for Nashville. I do, however, love their spring rolls. Their décor is a little cheese ball, but I like cheese ball so dig it..

"501 Donelson PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"The bar for BBQ in Nashville, it's just disappointedly low. This is a very cute little restaurant and the food really isn't particularly bad. It just isn't that good. I'm almost hesitant to call it BBQ. The brisket plate I had the meat was dry, no hint of smoke and not particularly much flavor to speak of. The beans were pedestrian, again, no hint of smoke, no savory sweetness, bland sauce. Canned? That's my bet. What's going on with this? The strips were thin and a little tough to cut with a fork. The cornbread a little dry and the okra, which actually looked like maybe it wasn't out of a bag frozen, had more stringy bits than I'm used to experiencing. Will say the people working here though were really, really nice.There's nothing here resembling the grand Memphis BBQ on the west end of the state, and there sure as hell isn't anything even approaching Kansas City BBQ I'm used to. I could get used to the Carolina sauces and flavors and have enjoyed them in other parts of the South. Whoever is managing this beautiful venue, suggest they get out and eat at a few other places in town, and then have a meal in your own restaurant and tell me you aren't tasting the difference.

After we got our food which took some time The server never came back but once after we were through eating just get our dishes. Usually the services and the food is really good last night that was not the case.

My sister found this place on Yelp of course and our full minivan with me at the wheel headed straight to Bar-B-Cutie. You walk in and the menus are on the wall leading you to the register like it was Sizzler. They have combo plates, many sides to choose from, a kids meal and desserts. I ordered our meals, grabbed a number and occupied a long table.Our food arrived and it was sooo good. The corn bread was unbelievably good. The chicken and pork were good and the fried pickles were delicious. But the best thing about this place behind the corn bread was their selection of sauces from mild to Tennessee Fire and whoooo boy, it'll make you sweat! Oh, they were soo good. So good I bought four bottles. Two for me, two for friends that personally requested bbq sauce as payment for watching baby (my Boston Terrier) at home. And they enjoyed them. When I'm almost out, I'll have to get my cousins to send me some. It's that good.Decor had a farm house feel but with a big flat screen on the wall.

I loaded up my pork with BBQ sauce to which you get a nice selection of at your table. It was well priced for 6.99 for the amount of food but I got what I paid for. The Mac and cheese was from a box and didn't seem fresh. The fried orca was equally tasteless and I didn't finish it. I wasn't given anything to dip it in and bbq sauce wasn't an orca dipping sauce in my opinion. I also got to try their cornbread which looks like a pancake. This was equally tasteless and neither I or the person who ordered it finished it. No butter provided and it tasted bad. I didn't try the ribs which the meat fell off the bone but i was told it was very salty.

"501 Donelson PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I have reviewed this place a few times, and eaten there a few more. I believe today was my 7th or 8th time there in the last 2-3 months. The girl behind the counter gasped when I pulled out a little zip lock bag to pull out my card to pay, ""What?? You don't have a wallet?"" I explained I had recently lost mine (truth is I was a crime victim, and my wallet was stolen). Anyway... then another employee passing by stopped to comment on my zip lock bag as well (and the loud shock just kept spewing from the girls mouth... she could just not shut up).... while these comments were seemingly harmless to the people who said the words...it was incredibly embarrassing to me personally.... to have this racket going on so that other patrons were able to know my situation of not having an actual wallet. It really embarrassed me and hurt my feelings more than anything, and flooded memories from the night of the incident when my wallet was stolen.  This is what happens when establishments employ young people..and sometimes people who should be old enough to know better than to comment on things like this to someone spending money at your restaurant.My order was then kind of messed up, and the issue rectified... but this was my first sketchy experience at this particular location. It will most probably be a while before I return, if at all, and I will be experimenting with other bar b que places on the mean time. I NOW have a greater appreciation of other more negative reviews because the staff in there this afternoon could DEFINITELY use a customer service class....with a good dose of ""take the damn money and keep your mouth shut""One of the staff, I think overheard me telling my friend (who would not eat after the cashier shenanigans)  that it was embarrassing and kind of hurt my feelings...I was then asked 3 times in less than 10 minutes if everything was ok... on the meantime I was just cramming food in my mouth trying to eat fast to get the hell out.I have a policy about things like this... I will refrain from going here for 3 months and try again.... and if other negative experiences happen... it will just get crossed off my list.I will say the food is always ok for me... but today the customer service experience was well below average....or what should be experienced.",Bar-B-Cutie,6158720207,27 reviews,2014-10-03,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bar-b-cutie-nashville,1.0,131,"Washington, DC",Benjamin O.

"501 Donelson PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Yum, yum, yum!I was staying just outside Nashville this past weekend for a wedding, and my brother and I had a craving for BBQ and ribs. It was kind of a haul walking from the Embassy Suites, but it was worth it. I ordered ribs with sides of coleslaw, fried okra and BBQ toast. I know...oink. Whatever. My brother ordered the BBQ pork sandwich and a side of turnip greens. The food came out in just a few minutes, and the guy who served it was very friendly and nice. He also checked back once or twice to see if we needed anything. Being a huge fan of condiments, I loved how there were 5 or 6 kinds of sauce on the table, and they were all tasty (especially the Tennessee Fire).The one small drawback was that the okra was just kind of lukewarm, which wasn't a big deal, but I could see it annoying somebody who really likes their food to come out hot.

This Yankee loves BBQ and was thrilled a friend suggested this as a place to eat after being picked up at the airport. (Disclaimer, not sure this was the exact location but as a chain, I'm sure the standards are consistent.)We came in with three adults and three children during a busy lunch hour - one of the employees immediately approached us and helped us find a suitable table and highchair. Very nice and very appreciated. I saved the table and everyone else went to order - DH got me a large pulled pork sandwich with onion rings. YUMMY! I thought the pancake style cornbread was kinda weird and so did the kids but the baby loved them, lol. Really good Carolina and Sweet Sauces, among others, already on the table.

"501 Donelson PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"People must really hate airport food. That is the only possible reason I could see behind this place getting 4 & 5 star reviews!  I didn't realize it was a chain from the Yelp reviews that I read before choosing this restauraunt.  The location is great, right by the airport- and I was starving.I paid about $17 for a pulled pork platter and drink.  It was a heap of (almost cold by the time I got it) pulled pork, 2 cornbread pancakes (okay, that's weird.) and 2 sides.This place has the same set up as City BBQ (which I frequent in Cincinnati) but is nowhere near the level of quality, in my humble opinion.My first test for a barbecue joint- is ""Would I eat the meat with no sauce?""  Failed.  It was dry and the flavor was just nothing special.Second, because I LOVE barbecue sauce, I've got a pretty high standard for sauces.  I love to mix them.  In this case, the label on the sauces told me all I need to know.  ""Tomato ketchup with vinegar and spices.""  The label was the same on pretty much every bottle- and it was absolutely on point.  Tasted like ketchup and vinegar.  There were 5 different kinds, and I mixed 3 of them to come up with a flavor that I liked.  Well, kind-of liked.Whoever made the comment about the sweet tea being way past sweet was right on point.  I mixed less than a third of a cup into my un-sweetened tea and it was nearly too sweet for me even then!The cornbread, okay.  I wanted a muffin, or a slice of bread... but I got... a pancake.  A really dry flavorless pancake at that.  I ate half of a piece and left the rest.The mashed potatoes and gravy were so salty, I couldn't tell which was burning my mouth... the salt or the alternated bites of BBQ with Tennessee Fire sauce.  And I *LOVE* salt.  You know it's bad if I think it's too salty.The Mac N Cheese tasted like a stouffer's Mac n Cheese with a few tablespoons of water mixed in.  I almost asked for something different.You know what, I started this review with 3 stars, but as I remembered things, I changed my mind!  It wasn't the MOST AWFUL food I've had while traveling, but I probably will not go back.",Bar-B-Cutie,6158720207,127 reviews,2011-06-22,"Cincinnati, OH",/biz/bar-b-cutie-nashville,2.0,131,"Washington, DC",Jennifer D.

Their mild BBQ sauce is my current favorite. And although I know their banana pudding isn't homemade, I can't seem to get enough of it. Prices are always reasonable ($7 for dinner with two sides, depending on what you choose for your main meat selection) plus a few bucks for your selection of sodas or fruit teas.

"700 Thompson LnNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"My wife and I love calypso cafe. We are there once or twice every couple of weeks. I usually get the black bean salad with chicken.

That is my favorite part of the salad. I don't like salads and, at first glance, it looks unappealing to me because, well, it's salad. Upon digging in and tasting it, I am a believer. We also always get a side order of their boija muffins as well. They are a sweet cornbread type of muffin with coconut on top. The coconut isn't overwhelming, but there is enough to give it the flavor. My wife typically gets the beans and three and loves their sweet potatoes and black beans. And the fruit tea. I would come here just to get cup of this stuff to go. It seems to be iced tea with orange and pineapple juice mixed in. Very good.

"700 Thompson LnNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"Let me tell you about The Game. The game is to get a plate of black bean rice nachos and manage to eat them completely without using a fork or utensil and not look like you escaped from a mental institution.This is a more difficult endeavor than you might image as the plate is literally filled to the edges with nachos, beans, sour cream, rice, jalapenos, tomatoes, spanning a 10-12 inch wide plate and stacked like a pyramid rising 3-4 inches. It's then ""cemented"" together with what looks like volcanic eruption of cheesy goodness and served at a temperature that's somewhere between nuclear and burn ward.It's a whole lot of food when they make it like they usually do, and it comes to you hot and fresh and extremely fast.There's no middle ground with the black bean nachos. You either take them down or you go down fighting, leaving miserable and way way too full. You might even leave that way if you win the game.Additional challenges present themselves in the form of their fruit tea. Sometimes the greatest drink on the planet, the fruit tea is an inconsistent part of the Calypso Cafe experiment. When it's good, it's great, when it's bad, it's still good but is disappointing.People you bring with you can also be considered your enemies as they will attempt to push large, freshly-baked Boija muffins on you as they come two to an order and few can eat more than one.I should mention, silverware is provided. There's no reason you have to attempt to locate the optimum nacho to continue along your eating path. There's also no reason you shouldn't attempt to exercise and improve your cognitive nacho-pulling spacial skills in an attempt to leave no nacho behind while keeping your fingers clean.Should you think you beat the game, well, just remember that you lost the game. And if you don't know what that means a quick google search for The Game, or a look at your waistline after eating the nachos should be enough to cement that.Unfortunately the variety of this place, at least for vegetarians, does not change ever. It may be considered vegetarian friendly, but it's that because you can get a lot of food for little price, not because there's a vast array of choices (there are two that I will eat there.) The beans, they are beans, there's nothing done to them, and the rice, it's not special. The chips come from a bag and the tomatoes, sour cream, cheese, etc are all probably restaurant supply. Vegans are going to have a couple of options here, and I think I may be overselling it by saying a couple.The jerk chicken, I think, is the only thing they seriously work on. Everything else can be considered a plate full of fixin's.But the food is good, the service similarly so, the price reasonable, and as long as you're not attempting to go there when 400 other people are there (lunch) you'll probably have a good all-around time. If you're a vegetarian, go for the black bean rice nachos or black bean salad, I'd avoid the pita / veggie burger options as, well, I hate them and think they are stupid.But that's my opinion, and I just lost the game",Calypso Cafe,6152973888,573 reviews,2012-01-12,"Nashville, TN",/biz/calypso-cafe-nashville,4.0,96,"Washington, DC",Paul K.
"700 Thompson LnNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"I love Calypso, one of the few healthy choice places to eat. In addition, it is fairly quick and convenient!   I got hooked in East Nashville and when I moved to this side of town I was excited that there was another one close.  Great rotisserie, and I love the sweet potato side and house dressings!Although the food is just as good at this location, the atmosphere is not up to par.  Each of the 3 times I have been to this location there was food/ trash all over the floor and tables .  I'm not high maintenance, but it is nice to eat in a place that is kept clean and tidy.  It was not excessively busy and a handful of tables remained un-bussed for the entire time I was there.  Each of my visits.I haven't wanted to cut this restaurant out as a standard and I will give it another try at some point, I just hope that standards are raised and things are kept looking more sanitary.",Calypso Cafe,6152973888,3 reviews,2014-03-13,"Nashville, TN",/biz/calypso-cafe-nashville,3.0,96,"Washington, DC",Bonnie J.

"700 Thompson LnNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"When I came here, I wanted some SOLID cuban and/or caribbean food.  Upon arriving though, I realized this place (which I later realized is a chain) was much more healthy and vegetarian themed than I thought. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against vegetarian people.... I just really don't like vegetable only dishes. I was kind of put off by this. Also, they have some mexican stuff (nachos and maybe something else I'm forgetting), which kinda throws me off the whole cuban caribbean vibe. I briefly considered leaving, but stayed just to see what it was like, seeing as there were a couple options that had chicken.Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised. I ended up getting Nachos and they had some pretty tasty salsaish thing on them, and the chicken was flavored well and it was a decent size portion and everything. So at this point I'm thinking this is an okay place, but there really aren't that many options for someone who wants meat. In particular, they lack pork on a lot of their dishes, and I say a lot of their dishes, because I know cubans, and cubans freakin love their pork, and it's like on half their dishes. This chain is essentially sort of a mesh of several hispanic foods..... further meshed with a desire to make them healthy and/or vegetarian. Too bad cuban food is one of those cuisines that is inherently unhealthy.",Calypso Cafe,6152973888,244 reviews,2012-08-29,"Austin, TX",/biz/calypso-cafe-nashville,3.0,96,"Washington, DC",John S.

"700 Thompson LnNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"Looking for a place to grab a quick bite to grab lunch or dinner, somewhere that offers mostly healthy options and is inexpensive? My solution for you happens to be my favorite ""fast"" food in all of Nashville: Calypso Café. So what if I have eaten there three times in the last week? Those who have been will understand why, and those who haven't.. well, give it a try and you'll get it too.A super casual, local-to-Nashville hot spot, Calypso offers several locations throughout the area, so you're bound to be close enough to one for a quick meal. I must confess, when I first moved to town six and a half years ago, my mind/palette wasn't quite ready for Calypso. I thus ignored all of the local hype, which unfortunately caused me to miss many years of their delish cuisine (disclaimer/reminder: from small town, we only had those 'wonderful' super chains and maybe a gas station or two to choose from). Learn from my mistake, and do yourselves a favor and prepare to broaden your horizons just a bit.Calypso offers what I would call fresh Caribbean inspired cuisine. Roasted chicken, creative sauces, incredible sides. My most beloved adjective best sums it up: FABULOUS.Here are my fave items to order:Nachos. Tortilla chips smothered in their bean dip. The other standard nacho ingredients; chicken, beef, or rice, and BBQ sauce. Simply divine.Black Bean Salad. Lettuce, black beans, tortilla chips, cheddar, tomato, red onion; chicken beef, or rice, and a side of BBQ sauce. Try an extra side of their unbelievable house salad dressing too.Pulled BBQ White Chicken. Fresh, tender, rotisserie chicken with an absolutely amazing sauce. Get it as a sandwich or a plate.Bean and Corn Salad (side). A mixture of beans, corn, in a cilantro vinaigrette. Just yum.Sweet Potatoes (side). The perfect amount of sweet and spice.House Salad dressing. Simple: Pour it on everything.Fruit Tea. Some of the best in town. When in Rome.Calypso Bar. One of my favorite desserts, ever-- their take on a cookie bar. Simple, sweet, a bit sour, just delicious.Ok.. There's my take. What are your favorite dishes at Calypso?",Calypso Cafe,6152973888,22 reviews,2013-09-19,"Nashville, TN",/biz/calypso-cafe-nashville,4.0,96,"Washington, DC",Matt N.

The Native coleslaw was like normal coleslaw with a mayo vinaigrette sauce..and the mustard Greens are vinaigrette flavored with onions and stewed tomatoes ( you can taste the vinaigrette in the tomatoes)..I like the collards very much and so did Tony..The other plate was Rotisserie White Quarter Chicken with a Jerk sauce (hot hot hot on the side) and Cuban Black Beans with raw red onions and sour cream ( very good..highly recommend) and St Lucian Rice..another very good taste..I would definitely eat here again, but next time stay at the restaurant and enjoy the atmosphere there with the island music playing and the beachy feel to the restaurant.

"700 Thompson LnNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"Caribbean-style food in Nashville? Yum! There are two ways to look at this place - comparing it to a fine dining establishment versus comparing it to a fast food joint. The food is amazing when you do the latter - they specialize in jerk chicken, but the vegetarian options include black beans, Caribbean-style rice, collard greens, cole slaw, salads, veggie-sandwich, corn and chickpea and kidney bean medley, and cornbread (aka ""Boija muffins""). Now, is all the food fresh? Probably not, but neither is everything at Baja Fresh or Panera or most restaurants these days, and the options here are a refreshing change from a sandwich or burrito. Their veggie-melt sandwich is good but nothing special (just raw veggies & cheese on a bun), so I would go for the platter where you get 4 sides, one of which (per the restaurant) must be the black beans.  If you are comparing the food to a fancy tablecloth and candlelit restaurant, then you will be disappointed, but the bill here can be less than $7 a person! I've tried the food at the Vanderbilt/Elliston Place location as well; it's the same menu so just go to wherever is closer. The atmosphere at both places is similar (cheap plastic chairs and table), and definitely not nice enough for a formal meeting or special date, but I could see a successful first or casual date or friend gathering here. The to-go service is also very fast because a lot of the food is already prepared. Regardless of the atmosphere, their cornbread muffins can hold their own compared to at any restaurant!

Also, when he poured our drinks, I could smell his lingering B.O. for quite a while. Dude. Fix that shit now, restaurant owner. Haircuts. HAIRNETS! Shaves. SHOWERS! DEODORANT! Are they even washing their hands? Clean nails.  If your employees have a problem with that, than don't work in a restaurant, then.It also seemed like everyone here was a little depressed. No one smiled much. Moral seems really low. I felt bad for them. The poor hygiene really made me uncomfortable. I know what goes on ""backstage"" in a kitchen, and if an owner is willing to let hygiene slide to this degree, I don't feel comfortable patronizing it.  It's YOUR responsibility, restaurant manager, to stay on their shit about hygiene, and fire anyone who slacks. This is representing your brand, and it makes patrons uncomfortable. What are you running, a 7-11? Health food doesn't mean grimy smelly employees getting their hair and B.O. in my food, thanks. Unprofessional. Also, the bathrooms were extremely clean, but the smelled musky, pretty bad. How about some Renuzit. About one would solve your problem.Also, none of your employees smiled at me. Only one of them acknowledged me. None of them used the time honored ""trick"" of touching the table as they took my order to increase friendliness and get a bigger tip. This should happen EVERY time they approach the table- touch it, tap it, say 'Hi!"" freakin smile. Would it kill them? Seemed like it. When we walked in, no hostess walked up to us. We were pointed at from behind the counter by a guy who shouted as us to ""seat yourselves up against the wall!"" When I paid the check, I was ignored once again, as the cashier talked the entire time to his buddy, and didn't thank me for dropping in. Rounding out the customer service experience! :(  Don't want to break up your coffe Klatch, dude.Okay, buddy. Just.... it doesn't even seem like there is a manager on duty here. It looks like a restaurant, but it needs to tighten the ship. What the eff? Nice space, fun art and vibe, but ... Someone needs a manager to run the ship like a real restaurant with polite employees who are clean & friendly and run things properly. And get some renuzitt in the bathrooms!

Don't get me wrong, I know that not all dining establishments offer these options but it I was a little surprised that a place that specializes in healthy and veg options didn't?I chose the Spiced Sweet Potatoes, Cuban Black Beans, and the Martinique Callaloo for my lunch and I have to agree with fellow Yelper Lee K that everything tasted as if it came from a can. The prices are fantastic and the service is quick so maybe I am unfairly comparing Calypso Cafe to finer dining establishments instead of a fast-food joint?

YES.  SIgn me up! For you beer snobs, the bar doesn't have a ton of beer options, but there will be something you like and there are GAMES!  I stayed here for four hours drinking and playing cards against humanity next to a badass taxidermed armidollo (from Hail). With a tab of $15.  Why are you going anywhere else East Nashville?

"411 Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",4.0,"This review is going to just be honest, and not biased. I was a huge fan of the ""old"" Dino's. But I won't let this cloud my review. I went in for dinner. I love the way they still kept the same decor, and the same beer in cans. I got a burger, and asked for only pickle, and onion. on my cheese burger. I watched the guy make it and he was making a few others at the same time. I saw he added lettuce, tomato and everything to them all. He then asks me ""you got what on yours?"" I said ""onion and pickle only"". He looks at both of the burgers he made and they had the same thing on them (lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle) and he hands me one, as if one didn't have lettuce and tomato. LOLNo big deal, I'll pick it off. I start eating and the burger is really deep red, and cool in the center. :( I don't remember if he asked me how I wanted it done but if he did ask me, I always ask for ""medium well, no pink"". This was deep deep red and cool. I felt unsafe eating it. I liked the fries mixed with salt and pepper. Not a fan. The burger (the part I could safely eat) tasted NOTHING like the way Rick used to make them. Oddly enough, I saw Rick walking in from the back. I guess they've made him an honorary guest or something. Riverside Grill shack still has the best burgers in my opinion.If the staff cared as much of the food, and the quality of the food, and the accuracy of the food order, as they did about maintaining reputation as being ""the same Dino's""  then maybe you'd have something.

"411 Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",4.0,"I had the honor of eating a Dino's bacon cheeseburger on the last day that Dino's served burgers (on their final day, apparently Rick wasn't going to cook burgers, but Thanksgiving food). That's right, folks. Dino's, as we know, is no more. Rick sold the business and is going fishing.This place was a total dump, with old everything and brown (once white) smoke-stained ceiling tiles. I can just imagine Robert Irvine walking in and throwing a tantrum.Rick - the owner, bartender, and grill master - was exactly as advertised. I asked him what he recommended, and he quipped something along the lines of ""You want me to tell you some of my food is bad?"" So I told him I was between the bacon cheese burger and the patty melt, to which he said I'd better get out from in between them because that'd be too much to eat.We all ordered burgers and fries, and Rick got to work behind the bar. 30 minutes later, Rick presented me with a plate full of tasty looking food. The thick burger was well done but juicy, well seasoned, and noticeably had not been smashed down. The bacon and veggies were crisp, and the fries were golden, crunchy, and well seasoned.

"416 4th Ave SNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"My friend set up a happy hour get together here but... there's no actual happy hour specials for this restaurant. Bummer. They have 3 main Margarita flavors ( Lime, Mango and Strawberry) but you could get a Mango/Strawberry if your heart desires. I ordered the mango one but thought it was a bit too sweet so my boyfriend and I mixed the lime and mango together. Much better. We ordered the Fajita Texana for two. This came with shrimp, beef and chicken. The meats were very well seasoned and we were very pleased with it.We sat on the patio and it was beautiful... very open and you have a view of town town especially of the Omni.

"416 4th Ave SNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"The steak fajitas, not chicken are the jam there at Little Mexico texmex joint. This bar & grill gets more cred from me for their cool drinks like the yummo margaritas, and from hanging out on the deck which looms on a hill over the back of the Music City Center convention site. The combo plate of a varied sort from their kitchen was just only average so so texmex not much better than elsewhere. Their redeemed by their fajitas. I taste a generous amount of inebriating tequila in their margaritas so thats good too. Its handy for downtown but not as good a value as the cuisine at Nuvo Burrito across the street in the Peabody Corner food court. Like the Peabody Corner restaurants Little Mexico has its own free private parking lot. Of course thats a important factor for a downtown eatery!

"2730 Lebanon PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I really liked this place, my wife thought it was just OK but I'm writing this review so I'm giving it 5 stars. I'm just visiting Nashville from California so I'm not sure if this type of place is common here but given the music scene I would assume it would be. Vibe: a hipster/alternative vibe, slightly grungy but clean. This is the type of place I would typically spend a lot of time in. Everyone who worked there was friendly and welcoming. They had a stage so I assume they have live music some times. I went for lunch on a weekday. The kitchen smoke haze kind of hangs over the place, which is not ideal but could be fixed with an open window and a fan. Food: we had a large take out order for 8 people. I had the black bean burger, which was great. My father-in-law had the chicken Caesar wrap which he really liked. Everyone else had veggie sandwiches without hummus but realized that was a mistake and so added our side of hummus to their sandwiches which made them better. We ordered a random sample of sides, all of which were good. My favorite was the tomato and mozzarella salad but the black bean and corn salad was great also.

"2730 Lebanon PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I was excited to try Phat Bites after reading the reviews.  Everyone was spot on from the decor to the food.  I chose the spicy Dijon turkey sandwich and my husband went with the Big Jerk.  The spicy Dijon is no joke.  I had to scrape some of the Dijon  off, but still thoroughly enjoyed it.  The Big Jerk was a crowd pleaser as well.  We split the mozzarella and tomato salad...it was ok.  We got two iced coffees to go and the flavor was phenomenal.  Chocolate rocket fuel is the only way I can describe this delicious cold brew beverage.  I got a dab of almond milk in mine and my husband chose to wait and add some bourbon cream from his stash.  Both were delicious.   Highly recommend grabbing some iced coffee on your way out to keep you going.Next time I will definitely try a wrap..somehow missed that menu board when ordering.  Very friendly staff as well.",Phat Bites,6298880211,15 reviews,2015-08-17,"Louisville, KY",/biz/phat-bites-nashville-3,4.0,78,"Washington, DC",Kim F.
"2730 Lebanon PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"To be honest, I probably would have rated it highly before even trying the food just because it's one of the few unique places in the Donelson area with a good atmosphere, live music, and nice bar with local brews on tap.The good news is - the food is great! And even better, it's really affordable! I've eaten here four times in the month I have lived in the neighborhood. I love coming here and everything I'd tried has been really fresh and tasty. I highly recommend the kale salad - with walnuts, raisins, craisins, sunflower seeds, black beans, and garbanzo beans - it's the best mix of flavors and textures. I get it as a side every time. You can also get samples of the dishes behind the glass display, if you're curious about something.I've also had excellent, friendly service at each visit.

"2730 Lebanon PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I was a bit bummed when Phat Bites moved to a new location, but I am pretty sure it's the same distance away from me, so no big loss! However, I drove past it the first time I visited, so keep your eyes peeled. It shares the same space as some nondescript business. I'm glad that the space is a lot bigger and they now have plenty of parking, even at peak times. The food, menu, and staff are the same. I came in for lunch a few times recently, and if you go early, you are golden. Anywhere between 11-12:00 you are fine. However, I stopped in around 12:30 and the line was long and order taking a bit annoying. I also waited about 15 minutes for my order, so it's not the quickest lunch option out there. When ordering take out, I like for it to be pretty quick, but expect to be at Phat Bites for at least 30 minutes at peak times. I still love the black bean burger that they offer.

"2730 Lebanon PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Holy hipster! I enjoyed this little place in a strip mall off of Lebanon Pike but I would have to warn others to expect a hipster/green atmosphere before heading here. It was cool and made me feel a little more edgy and healthy but I'm not sure it's for everyone.As far as the food, I came in and got a to-go wrap and Kale Salad today. The Ninja Bomb was a surprise. I did not expect the bag to weigh as much as it did when I picked it up and was amazed at the size, freshness, and flavor of the wrap. It's got chinese chicken salad, granola, carrots, lettuce, and raspberry vinaigrette for a crunchy, sweet wrap flavor. It's so good! The Kale Salad was also excellent as a side and had pecans, golden raisins, and couscous (I think) in it. It was just the right flavor and didn't include any unwanted flavors that Whole Foods often puts in theirs like red onions.Pros:Serving size and flavor. I was able to split the wrap and have two full meals off of the side salad and wrap. It was really impressive. The staff was kind, approachable, and happy to serve their guests. Cons:The atmosphere isn't very approachable for out of town guests so I'll just have to get them to trust me about the food.Overall:I really like that this place is truly different in a Nashville restaurant atmosphere which is often too safe, atmosphere-wise.

There was a ""help wanted"" sign on the door, so I wasn't too surprised that they appeared to be short-staffed. We finally had our order placed, and tried to figure out how to pay...We asked, and were sort of gruffly told to walk to the end of the line. We pay, sit at the cleanest table we could find, and waited... finally got our food, which was the highlight of the stop. My chicken salad was fresh and perfectly seasoned. Boyfriend had the Big Jerk -- a pork tenderloin situation on ciabatta -- which he raved about (albeit, it was a bit small).

"2730 Lebanon PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"The food is awesome,  huge side portions and wraps. My friend and I picked the first 2 wraps on the board to share. Forgot the names already, but one had pork, and the other had steak as the meat. Both had plenty of veggies, rice, and other goodies stuffed and rolled tight in their wraps. We picked 3 salads (the Greek, broccoli, and sweet potato) for sides to try. Each were good, but both of our favorites were the Greek. Layout and where you have to go to pay is a little confusing, but the staff is nice and helped us new-bees. Tall ceilings and open kitchen concept in a auto garage shell is fine with us. Walls were decorated in awesome graffiti art, and we enjoyed looking at the album covered tables, games, and local art. Staff had an eclectic look and were well trained- didn't act like corporate robots. Which is always a plus.

"2730 Lebanon PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Holy disappointment, Batman. This place used to be amazing! When I was pregnant this was my go to lunch spot. Service was amazing, food was to die for. I practically LIVED on caprese sandwiches. Then I went on maternity leave. I come back and the entire staff has turned over. What used to be a business filled with happy hipsters making slammin sammiches turned into a place filled with unfriendly, unsmiling, slow moving workers. I ordered a sandwich to go yesterday and ended up back at the office late from my hour long like break. Never again. They lost a long time, faithful customer yesterday. I would be hard pressed to go back unless I hear that they made major improvements. Attitude from the grill workers and eye rolls mixed with zero eye contact from the cashier.

"2730 Lebanon PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Today was my first time trying Phat Bites. Unfortunately we went to the old location on Allen Rd that is now closed. I was under the impression that they just opened an ADDITIONAL location, not just moved locations. It wasn't a huge deal though since the new location was only a mile or so up the street. However, even with exact GPS guidance it's still hard to spot due to it's awkward location next to Ace Hardware and the fact that there's no sign other than some painting on the window. Upon entering I was a little afraid my 67 yr old Aunt was gonna look at me crazy for bringing her there. It's very eclectic, funky, rummage sale, dreadlock-ish inside. Luckily Aunt Suzie is the coolest person I know and she felt right at home. As other reviewers have stated, it is a little silly to have the menu board up high and behind where you order. And definitely some directional signs would be helpful. Aunt Suzie originally thought we were supposed to pay at the old-cash-register-turned-condiment -organizer. Bless her. As far as the food goes, what we had was good. I really liked my VIP sandwich and she said her Charlotte wrap was tasty as well. We didn't have to wait long at all for our food. Less than 5 minutes. The things that would make this a 5 star spot for me are the following:*get outdoor signage you can see from the street *get directional signage on the inside. ""Order here"" ""pay here""* new (or at least in better condition) tables and chairsI get that mismatched stuff is cool and eclectic, but some of the tables and chairs just looked broke down.

"2730 Lebanon PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I have never used Yelp before, but after my 1st ( and last ) experience at Phat Bites, I felt like I would be doing society a horrible injustice by not reviewing this place. First off, the place is located in an old Chinese buffet in Donaldson directly adjacent to a hardware store. The interior of the ""restaurant"" looks like a cross between a Spencer's gifts blowout sale and a scene from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2. The menu is on a chalkboard behind you. There are bread and cheese options, but it doesn't specify what they are.My GF and I ordered food ( I ordered a veggie wrap minus tofu, no cooking required, should be quick and easy), we were then told to go into a separate bar area to pay via tablet. No cash accepted?We sat down and waited for what seemed like an eternity, especially considering it was 5 o'clock on a week day and we were basically the only ones in the place. After 30 minutes had elapsed, my GF went to check on the progress of our meal, only to be told that they had forgot to make it. Given the circumstance, This is completely unacceptable. I'm only leaving two stars because the beer I had during our wait was quite good and the bartender that refunded our money was (seemingly) genuine in her apology to us.The food may or may not be decent here, but due to the Decor, bad service, and terrible location, I will never know.",Phat Bites,6298880211,8 reviews,2014-07-08,"Nashville, TN",/biz/phat-bites-nashville-3,2.0,78,"Washington, DC",Doug J.

"2730 Lebanon PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I work super close to the new location of Phat Bites and finally had time today to stop by for some takeout. The new location is awkward to say the least. The inside order area/menu area is also super awkward and doesn't make sense, not to mention the food prep area looks like such a hot mess. They were cooking something on a single portable burner. What?!Anyway. I walked in while another customer was finishing her order. There were two girls helping her, one of which was wearing booty shorts and boots, which was strange to see in a restaurant. I felt like I was at Deja Vu. The lady ordered and I stepped up to order but both of the girls walked off. They walked back my way about 3 or 4 times and the male cook also looked at me and no one seemed to think that I was of any importance. I stood at the counter for about 4 more minutes before turning around and walking out. I almost told the businessman who was walking in to go elsewhere, but I decided not to take that route. I was super excited to eat at Phat Bites because it's maybe a block away from my job and I needed a new place to eat on a regular basis. Based on my visit today, I won't be returning. Learn some customer service skills, dress like you have some self respect, and get some management in this place. If you're too busy to help a customer immediately, ACKNOWLEDGE THEM.

"2730 Lebanon PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"My wife and I took our granddaughter after looking online for restaurants that were featured on the FoodTV show ""Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.""  You have to go to this place with a completely open mind, and for us the hippie mystique wore off fairly quickly.  It was really hot outside and it wasn't much more cool inside.  It was uncomfortably warm, which is probably due to the fact this is in an old service garage in a building shared with an Ace Hardware.  There were flies buzzing around and landing on the food, the cement floor was painted and there was an eclectic collection of old, discarded furniture.  All of the furnishings looked like recycled stuff.... you know, someone else's junk.  I really liked my sandwich, although I agree with my wife's assessment that the steak strips were tough.  The flavors worked for me and I don't mind grinding meat with my molars but my wife was spot on - the meat wasn't tender.  There is nothing for a typical ""kid"" so beware anyone under 16 might not want anything on the menu.  Our granddaughter ordered the grilled cheese, which was the only thing that didn't sound foreign to her.  They asked her what type of bread and cheese she wanted and of course she asked for ""white and American.""  They asked if sourdough would be okay and we assured her she should try it.  They failed to tell us they substituted cheddar for American - you know you can tell the difference and even a kid isn't fooled - and they used mayonnaise instead of butter to brown the bread.  Technically it was almost burnt, and to my granddaughter two bites was all she needed to call it quits.  On our way out we laughed because two women happened to be leaving behind us and one said, ""my grilled cheese was burnt.""  Also, be aware there is graffiti on the walls and some of it is profane.  Not acceptable.  If this was a bar I would be okay with it because I don't take the kids to bars.  This was a DELI and therefore this was unacceptable.  Guy Fieri should remove this place from his ""Triple D"" listing.  WHAT A DIVE.  FAILED ON MULTIPLE LEVELS.",Phat Bites,6298880211,5 reviews,2015-06-29,"Hamilton, OH",/biz/phat-bites-nashville-3,2.0,78,"Washington, DC",Greg M.
"2730 Lebanon PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I loved Phat Bites before their move. They are even better now. Granted, it's a little tricky to find the first time being in the same building as Ace Hardware. I LOVE the chinese chicken salad and as long as I can get it that's what I will get. In salad with or without strawberries, but they are preferred, on a wrap, a sandwich, any way is always delicious.  From what I know, they use natural, local ingredients in their food. So those strawberries you can't always get, along with some other thing because they just aren't in season. I understand. The yum yum bars you can get year round really do make up for it and the wait for your food is usually not very long.

"2730 Lebanon PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Saw this on the food network on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and searched this place out to try the citrus kale salad that was featured on the show. I drove a friend up to Vandy for an appointment and decided to have an early lunch here. Finding the place was a little bit difficult because it is BEHIND the ace hardware store in the same parking lot. There wasn't a sign indicating it was there. Parked in front at about 11am. Location looked like it used to be a car garage. Windows were tagged with the name of the business. I thought it was kind of cool. Went in and the place definitely was much larger on the inside. The decor is eclectic and urban. Had a chill atmosphere kinda like just a place to hang out and eat good food. I had to ask where the menu was and it's high up on the ceiling on chalk boards above the door.  Also told him that it was hard to find and it would be useful to have a bigger sign. One of the guys said that they were having one done and should be up soon. I mentioned that they should have one of the area's graffiti artists to make a sign for them to fit in with the decor. He kinda chuckled but i think he was just humoring me. The kitchen was in the open and everyone seemed to be busy. There was a variety of cold salads that all looked good and healthy. All the ingredients are organic and fresh. They were cooking on an free standing electric grill but they recently moved and it just fits in somehow. It reminded me of a large island cabana roadside food cafe. And EVERYONE knows that those things have the BEST food!! Anyways....The menu items had some crazy names but i think it tied in to the atmosphere well. They had a lot of items to choose from and they all looked good. I chose a turkey, bacon wrap with hummus, avocado and of course a plate of the kale salad! My friend chose the ruban sandwich and we sat down at one of the tables. I looked around a bit while we waited due to the only ones in there at the time. They have lounge couches and an area for a open mike poetry or local band. The garage doors looked like they would open up during the summer months and be kinda like a great place to just chill and have a beer. There wasn't a theme, it was just random and trippy. I loved it. They just picked furniture that they liked. I am a bit of a eclectic myself and i was comfortable. The place was clean!! I don't know why ppl gave such bad reviews. The food was AMAZING. They are not skimpy on the portions either. Most organic places give you a tiny plate that looks too pretty to eat. This place is no joke. It's like an urban free birds ( texas ppl you know what I'm talking about!!) If you're OCD about themes and matching things. And focus on the decor more than the food then you should probably not go there. I could only eat half the wrap and it was fresh!! The humus in it was amazing and the turkey tasted like they had prepared the bird. The bacon was crisp and yummy. The avocado was fresh and the pickle on the side was just crazy good. I could eat a jar of those things. My friend could only eat half of his reuben too. But he said that it was really good as well. One of the best one's he's had. The kale salad was A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!!! I have a love/hate relationship with kale. It's really good for you but i hate the taste of it. The salad had fruit and nuts in it, beans and a citrus dressing!! OMG!! I could of ate a bucket of that stuff. Half way through eating, people started flooding through the door about 12pm. It was a very popular place for lunch and you had a huge variety of people there. Just random people with no theme looking for a great place to eat!! I will def be back to this place when I'm around that area. It's pretty close to the highway too. I left full but not stuffed, light and not heavy. Great place with amazing food! If you want to think outside of the box, take off your shoes and chill for a bit and experience amazing organic food, i encourage you to go here.  I will def. be back! :) Great place!!",Phat Bites,6298880211,68 reviews,2014-11-05,"Clarksville, TN",/biz/phat-bites-nashville-3,5.0,78,"Washington, DC",Jean J.

"2730 Lebanon PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"So surprised that this place does not have better reviews. Everyone seems overly concerned with the decor, and not focused on the delicious, fresh made food that is served. My mother lives right in the area, and has been talking about Phat Bites like it is heaven on earth. I finally was able to come today for lunch. So happy they were open on Labor Day.On to the important stuff. It was busy when we went in, around 1230pm, but we were still greeted and as I was clearly overwhelmed with what to order, one of the workers suggested his favorites. I had a turkey wrap, my mother had a caprese sandwich, and we also ordered some spinach and feta hummus. Unlike the other reviewers, I found the decor to be refreshing. There are so many chain restaurants in Nashville, and especially in the Donelson area, that it's wonderful to see a place that thinks outside the box. We are New Yorkers, and Phat Bites feels like home for us. After about a 5 minute wait, we were served and I was ecstatic. Not only was the turkey fresh, it was not deli turkey. Someone clearly slaved over cooking a whole turkey, the mayo was freshly made, the veggies were ripe, and the quick pickle on the side was beyond delicious. My mothers fresh mozzarella was to die for, and the ciabatta bread was up to par with anything we'd get freshly baked in New York. But the hummus was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I would return just for that.If the ""hipster"" decor and staff are too ""dirty"" for you, then you are seriously missing out(by the way, everything I saw was clean and all people preparing food were wearing gloves). Nashville needs to be educated on locally run and sourced restaurants, cafés, and delis. Paying $7 for a fresh wrap/sandwich/salad is much better than the same price for a value meal at mcdonalds. I will definitely be a frequent customer.",Phat Bites,6298880211,6 reviews,2014-09-01,"Nashville, TN",/biz/phat-bites-nashville-3,5.0,78,"Washington, DC",Alexa S.

"2730 Lebanon PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Not horribly impressed.  Arrived at 5pm on a Saturday and they were out of beef and pork.  Got the buffalo chicken sandwich and it ended up being okay.  Also, I found it a bit awkward to order...the menu is too extensive to stand there and look up to try to figure it out.  Handheld menus would make more sense to me.  Staff seemed kinda  disengaged, but I'll give it another shot sometime with the hopes of a better experience.",Phat Bites,6298880211,1 review,2014-11-29,"Nashville, TN",/biz/phat-bites-nashville-3,2.0,78,"Washington, DC",Mike M.

"2730 Lebanon PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"The review from Michael G is spot on. This place is REALLY screwing up something that other restaurants would kill for: a lot of hype. Forget about the food; it simply doesn't matter when the service is so awful. The people are friendly and all, but they don't seem to have a process for taking orders, building, cooking, etc.I have been there twice now and both times the wait was over 20 minutes AFTER ordering.

"2730 Lebanon PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,Food quality has fallen over the past three years.  Their reuben used to be good.  Now it's a joke.  Arby's at least uses SLICED corned beef brisket.  Chopped? Are you kidding? Just a way to disguise the low quality and toughness of their brisket and VERY SKIMPY portion as well.  They apparently have borrowed from their name and now only give a BITE of meat in their reuben. Complained to the manager about this change and it seems it's of course the owner's decision.  I guess without the deeper pockets of your old owner (ellendale's) you decided to sacrifice quality to control food costs.  You won't have my future business any longer.  And the music was too loud for the filling station acoustics!  Goodbye.,Phat Bites,6298880211,5 reviews,2014-11-13,"Lebanon, TN",/biz/phat-bites-nashville-3,1.0,78,"Washington, DC",Iknow B.

"2730 Lebanon PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Unfortunately, I am not able to say anything good about my experience there. I am all for supporting local businesses, but only when their service is worth it. Today was my first experience with this restaurant and it was not so great. What I am gonna say might seem critical, but they are points that I feel would serve the establishment well if they took notice. First off, the whole chalk board menu thing is cool and all, but there should also be some printed menus up front for people to look at. It is hard to place your order when the menu is behind you. Also when it came to ordering, I just assumed that you went straight to the cash register to place your order. I was quickly advised that I had to place my order back around the corner where there was already a line stacked up. I feel some simple directional signage would have easily helped in this situation. After ordering, my wife and I found our seats and preceded to wait...and wait...and wait some more. Finally our name was called with only one of our orders ready. I assumed the best and figured mine would be out soon. I get it if you are low on staff that day, but maybe just being up front with the customers saying ""it might be a little while longer than normal today"" might help. 50 minutes after ordering, we were forced to go up to the counter and ask about the missing order. She quickly scurried around and found a ticket with my name on it and handed it to me. At this point I was just ready to leave so we took our sandwiches to go and were out. It wasn't until I got home that I realized I had the wrong order.

"730 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"This place is great for large groups.  We had a bachelor party of at least 20 and the service did not disappoint.  We only had one waitress taking orders, but 2 or 3 others bringing food and drinks to the table on a regular basis.The tap list was pretty good.  Coming from Colorado, I know very few places will be able to beat the local tap selections.  As I said before, the drinks were delivered amazingly fast for the size of our group.  I was one of the last to order my beer and only had to wait about 5 minutes.  A few people in the group ordered the whiskey flight.  I was a little jealous I did not order one to start, so I kept with my beer.The menu is heavily dominated with burgers, so this is naturally what I ordered.  It was delicious since I had been craving a burger for a few weeks now.  I ordered the Cuban Burger and it did not disappoint.  It is usually interesting to see a traditional ethnic sandwich turned into a burger, but Pour House did not let me down!

"730 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Absolute disaster. We sat at the bar and the bartender refused to take our drink orders until we ordered food. We were given to understand the kitchen was about to close (at 9:00 on the Sunday of a holiday weekend?) but not taking drink orders while we briefly reviewed the menu? That's just bad service. Bartender wanted to serve me a cider he'd ""just poured five minutes ago"" that he took out of the fridge below the tap system rather than pour me a fresh drink. He was furious when my husband requested said fresh cider, as if it were somehow my fault that the person who had ordered the stale drink left. We couldn't understand half of what he mumbled even as he flitted around behind the bar and through the restaurant with more nervous energy than I've ever seen outside of a person on drugs. When my husband and I wanted to cancel our food after realizing the bartender was quite likely on drugs, we got a lot of attitude. Rather than give us our bill, he called out the amount and was offended when we requested a print out. After running our card (which he snatched from my husband's hand quite violently) but before we could give him our signed copy, he screamed at my husband to ""get the hell out"" for daring to speak to another customer who had asked for the manager as her party of eight was being mistreated by their server. (The manager was no where to be found by the way, how convenient.) The bartender was so peeved, he finalized our bill and slammed it on the bar without ever viewing the signed copy and before inputting the tip amount. Apparently our (gratuity) money was no good to him. What an absolute joke of a restaurant. I understand they're a chain.

"730 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"I always doubted the reviews that talk about Pour House as havi ng an awesome location. Corner of a 4 way red light surrounded by restaurants in a huddle then kind of...blah and interstates, was not convinced. I ascended the steps to the giant upstairs porch with fans blowing, a lovely breeze, mister going and covered indoor-covered outdoor options, a huge bar, and pull down awnings for cold or rain. The breeze blew in, the city skyline sprawled in front of me and I didn't even remember the interstate was hiding behind the building. Check, I do agree the location is spectacular...except stupid parking. It's not really a busy area, it's just that there are limited streets to actually choose from parking on. I snagged a bit of mint from one of the plants and pulled up a happy hour menu while waiting for my friends to arrive. We tossed a table around a bit to coordinate breeze to fan ratio perfection in the humid hot day, the bartender swept around and he was very kind - got us menus, waters, beer for me. Service was greatt, loved the. I'm pay and the easy feeling that we could hang out for hours. What got me down was the food. I wanted slider veg option but had to go for full burger portabello...which really didn't take up more than half the bun and I got a wimpy little slice of gouda on top. So it was a nice slider portion for full price. They aren't totally generous with sweet potato fries. I had just spent an hour and a half between cycling and running so I was ready to get big pile of fries on. Weak. That said, the food was pretty awesome. Bun was just a buttered bun, ingredients were simple but the fries were crispy and I loved the ketchup. Their truffle aioli though is ameteuer overly truffle oiled down and cloggy super greasy, did not like. Overall I do like the location, but that stupid small portion grumped me out lots and it felt a bit bitty for the price. Yummy, when you keep it simple.

This one would not be on the list.  Our six ounce burger was so lean, there was no juice on the plate.  A dry beef patty.As we have said so often...  a little fat makes for a great tasting burger.  This one had no flavor.Would not repeat.We were lucky, we had an attentive waitress.Our glasses of water were kept filled.The sides were ample - and plenty of variety.It's close to the gulch.. close to downtown..They will probably stay in business because of their location.The food isn't bad, but if you're a burger lover... you will probably judge this place on the burger, alone.1 star to the burger.",Pour House,6157365727,394 reviews,2015-07-03,"Nashville, TN",/biz/pour-house-nashville-2,3.0,129,"Washington, DC",Queen B.

"730 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"I really wanted to love this place. I like the size of the place & set up. The building has glass garage doors so during the warmer part of the year they can open them up so it's like you're dinning outside even when you're inside. I'm a sucker for that. We had a reservation at 7pm on a Saturday for a party of 5. We arrived and waited a few minutes and realized the group in front of us were given out table. We were sat at a booth that could fit 4 comfortably, & 5 was okay if the fifth person didn't mind hanging off the edge. To the server's defense, she did ask if we were okay sitting there & we said yes. We really didn't want to wait any longer for a table. This place as a huge bar & tons of televisions. It also has a large selection of bourbons & whiskeys. They actually have a walk-in room that had all the bottles displayed, pretty neat. Food - I ordered the mushroom Gouda burger & fries. I liked the taste of the burger, but for 11.75, the burger patty was almost the size of a slider & the bun was bigger than the patty. I could've been a larger patty. The fries were good, seasoned with some spices that made them kind of hot, but I liked that. Would I go back? Yea, if someone wanted to go there I would, but I don't know if I'd be the first to suggest it.",Pour House,6157365727,383 reviews,2014-04-06,"Nashville, TN",/biz/pour-house-nashville-2,3.0,129,"Washington, DC",Billy H.

"730 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"A mantra amongst my girlfriends and I is.. budget. Is it in the budget? Girl that is Not in the budget. More likely then not, one of those statements (if not all) will be dropped at least once on any given night. Last night was no exception. My friend wanted to grab dinner at a ""Poor House"" she had heard of. She felt, ""hey, that sounds budget friendly."" An O here, a U there. No difference right?Well we ended up at the Pour house. First tip- just valet park. If you are coming here on a Friday night, it can be painful to find a parking spot. Happy Hour: 2 cheeseburger sliders for $5, 2 for 1 Abita drafts on Friday, $5 apps such as queso and chili cheese friesDrinks: The pour house has over 130 different whiskeys. You can get just a smidge for ~$4 or you can get the full size for $10. Or you can custom make your own flight. They offer an okay selection of Scotch. Of note, my friends ordered cosmos (super pretty pink ones) from Kendra the bartender and said it was fantastic.Food: The group stuck to burgers. The portabello was very flavorful (definitely can taste the balsamic vinegar). The best part were the sweet potato fries- sub that for your regular fries please!Service: Now this is where they stood out. It was a Friday night... they were very busy but our server was the greatest. Our waters never were empty, she always checked in on us and our appetizers were out in.. maybe 2 minutes. The owner even stopped by to say hi.

Service was great, the beer was great, the food was great. The atmosphere is right up my alley. I had the mushroom burger and caesar salad. The burger was really good and a perfect option for a vegetarian. The caesar salad was good but was less creamy/anchovy version of a caesar and I liked their twist on it. The first beer I ordered was served perfectly with the perfect amount of head and tasted great. The second one lacked head when it hit my table but I will write that off as the only negative for the evening....and could have very well been the fault of the brewery.

We were seated and it took a couple minutes for our waitress to be identified, the hostess again was on top of this. The appetizers were great especially the pickles and peppers. I ordered the Big South burger, medium well (no pink). It was inedible dry, literally sucked any moisture out of your mouth. My dinner partners agreed. At the conclusion of the service the waitress asked how things were, I did mention that the burger was inedible. She immediately was able to address this concern with the manager Landon, who was apologetic and removed this item from the bill and even offered compensation.

"730 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"A group of friends and I went to Pour House on what was surprisingly a not very crowded, early Saturday night. We made reservations a good deal ahead of time to ensure that we would have our place here that evening. When we arrived early, we were all pleasantly surprised to find that our table was ready and waiting for us, so we sat down and began looking at our menu. As avid fans of a good drink, we were initially mostly interested in the adult beverage offerings. Our waiter came around to offer us water, and as we started asking about the seasonal choices for drinks, we realized we might not be getting the drink we hoped for as his knowledge was not only limited as to what they had, but non-existent. :-/ I ordered and Ommegang and some Chips and Guac, to which the waiter repeated back ""An Oh My God??"" While that is a fine name for the new imaginary brewery I would like to establish, it wasn't one that I had ever heard of (or ordered before). So, the waiter forgot my one order of an appetizer, but did remember my OM-meh-gang, and after being reminded of his error, he did eventually bring it out. When the rest of our table finally received our entrees, one of the burgers that was ordered was *severely* undercooked (if we can call it cooked at all). They happily fixed it, but the ordeal was starting to weigh heavy on our laid-back and hungry hearts.The check took about 25 minutes to arrive. Just before handing over our cards, they opened up the garage door-type windows to let the live band play directly into the ears of the sleeping baby that was a part of our group. When the day finally came for us to sign and walk away, I can honestly say that we were all relieved to finally part ways with Pour House. While I didn't check out the legendary patio and can't speak for everyone, I know that I probably won't be returning in the foreseeable future if I can help it.But if you do decide to check this one out - bonne chance to ya's. ;)",Pour House,6157365727,45 reviews,2014-08-17,"Nashville, TN",/biz/pour-house-nashville-2,2.0,129,"Washington, DC",Brenna S.

My husband and I seated ourselves, and we ended up waiting a long time to get service. Luckily, though, other waitresses stepped in to get us menus and water while we waited for our server. We were just out just for a relaxing evening, and we really didn't care if we had to wait even though we did notice it. (Probably lucky for our server! LOL) We just relaxed and enjoyed a beautiful evening on the porch.We've not had the server troubles since that night, luckily, and we've actually found everyone we've interacted with at Pour House to be awesome! We've tried something different each time we've gone. I highly recommend trying one of their bourbon flights. I'm not a huge bourbon drinker, but it was a lot of fun sampling different options and stepping outside of my Makers/Crown/Jack comfort zone. The beer list is great as well. In fact, when you get the menu, there is one page for food, and the rest of the menu is dedicated to their bourbons, whiskeys, wines and beers. This is definitely a place to go if you are interested in trying something different drink-wise!The menu, to me, is a little TOO limited. That, and the food prices, are literally my ONLY complaint about Pour House. (But not a big enough complaint to stop me from going back!) To me, the prices a little steep for what you are ordering. Luckily, everything I've ever had has been delicious. So that takes a bit of the sting out of the price. If I could give them any advice it would be to lower the food prices a little. I'd order more drinks and/or dessert if I didn't feel like I was spent already with my meal.

I personally felt the Pimento Cheese didn't go well with the burger, but I didn't want to order it WITHOUT in case they had discovered the next Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwich.  When I got rid of the Pimento Cheese and added some Ketchup, the taste was a bit better.  As a side I got the chips, which were great (and home style kettle) except they seem to only give you between 6 and 10.  This was not the case with a friend who got the fries and he had so many he didn't finish them.It was a work lunch so no Beers were had, but the menu did look pretty healthy overall.Service was a little slow, even though it didn't seem TOO busy, but that might have been that we were ready to get back to work and the waitress had not reappeared.Finally, they have RC Cola.  Some Cola Hipsters might dig this, but I always found DIET RC to be kind of ""Meh."", of course it is an atmosphere for beer, not for cola.I certainly would come back, but no pimento cheese on the burger next time.",Pour House,6157365727,787 reviews,2013-05-01,"Nashville, TN",/biz/pour-house-nashville-2,3.0,129,"Washington, DC",David O.

It was 19 minutes before the waitress came back. I asked for a beer and some water. I got my beer....20 minutes later. No water. I went and got my own water from the bar. I ordered wings. They came out 20 minutes later but at that point I had no beer or water and no waitress in sight. We asked someone passing by to get her. 15 minutes later she shows up. We order our food. The burgers are not that big for being 10-11 dollars and my side of fries consisted of 9 fries. Yes ..9 fries. Small Fries not big ones. I order a gin and tonic and a water refill.

"730 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"This is my first one-star review on Yelp.  It's actually upsetting me a little bit...I am a very bright-side-of-life kind of gal and more than willing to give second chances...but that will not happen here.  Nope, not ever.  I can honestly say I've never been so disappointed, so upset, over an experience like I had here.  I hate that I am having to do this, and I debated whether or not to say anything, but as you can plainly see I have sung the praises of so many places in Nashville that are more than deserving, and so I must be fair to my city and myself and be honest...and this place was HORRIBLE.I understand Pour House is relatively new but they've been open long enough that they, as a place advertising as a whiskey and bourbon bar, should HAVE A LIST OF WHISKEYS AND BOURBONS.  The answer all of us got, I kid you not, when we asked to see a list of the bourbons and whiskeys proudly displayed in gorgeous splendor in a glass case on the wall was, Oh we don't have a list but just look at the wall and pick what you want.Excuse me?!You've been open a week at least, a list should be in place.  I can type one up for you real quick if you want, in the note function on my smart phone if necessary.  Why do you not have a list telling patrons what they can have?  How do I know if I'm ordering a $10 shot of whiskey or a $100 one?  Is that your ploy Pour House?  Trick us into spending lots of money?  How can I make an educated selection without a menu?And the service was abyssmal.  I'm actually using that word...apparently their servers don't communicate because we had about 7 different people help us within 5 minutes of our arrival and all of them had something different to say.  5 minute wait, 10 minute wait, you can have this table OH WAIT this table doesn't have a server because people are doing their side work at this table, in front of people, while the place is open for another 5 hours (and when this girl was made to move oh boy did we customers know it because she was not happy!).  I don't know about you, but when I waited tables I would have gotten my butt handed to me if I did my side work in front of guests.  Oh and they were sweeping the floors too, while people are eating.  At 10pm when they are open until 2am.  Pretty sure the floor will get dirty again, and that was just gross.And they had a live band going, way too loud, for a place that seems a little small inside.  I couldn't figure out if they were going for a Broadway-style honky tonk, a chill bourbon bar, a family dining establishment, or some awful amalgamation of all that, but the result was bad.  We had one drink and left.  And despite the beautiful outdoor space they have for the warmer months, I won't be back here.  I will literally turn ddown birthday party invitations if they would take me hear.  I'm better off hitting up Frugal McDougal's next door, at least I'll get the bourbon I want and know what I'm paying for it.",Pour House,6157365727,299 reviews,2013-01-29,"Nashville, TN",/biz/pour-house-nashville-2,1.0,129,"Washington, DC",Bridgette C.

Didn't seem they were necessary because the restaurant wasn't very busy. We were immediately shown to a table and given menus. The waitress was prompt, but just that first time. We ordered water so we could look over the menu and huge selection of bourbons. I ordered a drink and some chips and queso. My drink never arrived and our waitress seemed too busy to be bothered with us. She eventually came back to take entre orders, but still no drink. They brought the wrong appetizer then a few minutes later chips and queso came out. A pitifully small portion for $6.00. The waitress disappeared and eventually our burgers came out. Burgers and sides were delicious. That's why they get 2 stars instead of one. But waitress was missing. We probably would have ordered more drinks had the waitress 1) brought the first drink we ordered or 2) asked. This place is in a great location and has a wonderful patio and the burgers are great.

"730 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"There were some major ups and downs during our visit.  To start, they'll valet your car but ask that you seat yourself.  I would much rather have a hostess than a valet attendant.  We found a table over in the male dominated corner. Turns out a bunch of fire fighters decided to roll in for beer and shots. There was also another huge group in the back booths. Because of this the kitchen and wait staff were experiencing some major delays.Even so, the wait staff tried to be as attentive as possible. Our waiter even tagged in another server when he became overwhelmed trying to close out the group of 20+.For the good, I ordered the buffalo chicken sliders and they were tasty.  The beer breaded mushrooms were good, but very breaded and a little oily. You get a slider or burger and one side.  My meal cost $7.00.  For that price, I was satisfied.  You should know that you only get two sliders, not three.  We also ordered the fried cheese. You get three large wedges, two of the three were packed with cheese.  My only qualm is that I wish they gave you more than a drizzle of marinara sauce. The beer list is quite extensive and somewhat impressive. The Atwater Vanilla Java Porter was delicious! I also had a Napa Smith Amber Ale.For the weird, customers stole every last one of their bourbon menus. When I asked about the bourbon our waiter said the list was just way too long to recreate from memory (understandable). Because of this I stuck with beer. This was 1. disappointing, they are a bourbon place and 2. totally weird. (Not the waiter's fault)  The management needs to print off another 100 menus, go to Kinko's and laminate it. I don't care if they need to do it every morning, it's an integral component of a diner's experience.  Overall I would go back.  I'm aware that a new restaurant needs to work out the kinks so they are getting a little extra leeway.

"730 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Oh Pour House, you cause me to have conflicting feelings about you.  Hopefully you can make me fall in love with you next time...We came for a little ladies night action and, at first, snagged a high-top table that was built around a huge square supporting pole (? can it be called a pole if it is square?  Oh well, you know what I mean).  So if someone was sitting across from you, you couldn't even see them, just a huge piece of wood.  However, they let us move to a large booth in the back beside the stage. Well, the reason no one was sitting there was because there was a leak, so the entire time I was getting hit in the head, face, lap, etc with drips of water.  Whatever, the place was packed and we decided to just go with it anyway.  When we told our waiter, just so he knew, he said ""it's leaking AGAIN?""  I thought they just built this mo fo?  Anyway, we ordered drinks from our first table that hadn't showed up yet, so we ordered more from our new waiter.  Drip.  Drip.  Drip.  Tick tock tick tock.  It took AT LEAST 30 minutes to get our drinks.  I know the place was packed out but dayum, it is VERY IMPORTANT TO GET THE DRINKS OUT FAST.  It helps people not be irritated with how long everything else is taking.The menu is great - all types of burgers are available including veggie, turkey, lamb, and I think i saw chicken.  Plus a few sides to choose from.  They also apparently have bourbon but they didn't have the menu on the table and the waiter didn't seem very much like he wanted to find one, so he just suggested some.  I ordered a lamb burger that comes with feta cheese, cucumbers, yogurt sauce, etc.  I was hoping that if it came even close to Hubert Keller's lamb burger at The Burger Bar it would be worth it.Drip drip drip tick tock tick tock....order 2 more drinks at one time....tick tock.So FINALLY after a really long wait the food starts coming out.  He declares he has a veggie burger and a bleu cheese burger.  No one at the table orders a bleu cheese burger.  So he disappears.  The burger sits there.  Other people's food randomly comes out by other waiters.  No sign of the guy finding out about the burger.  He just disappeared.  I took a good close look at it and realized it was MY LAMB burger, not a bleu cheese burger, WTF?!  So I started eating it, too bad it had already gotten cold.  When the waiter came back I just told him hey, that was the lamb burger and he stared and then said ""oh good"".  He wasn't checking on it, he totally forgot.So in his defense, it was packed out, it seemed that the bar and the kitchen were waaaay backed up and no one was able to keep up.  He was apologetic and seemed as though he was going to snap and run out the door at any minute.  Probably still new enough to have some kinks with all this stuff.  But you have GOT to know the food and you have GOT to get the drinks out FASTER than that!  Anyway, the lamb burger, despite being cold, was pretty good - a middle Eastern type flavor that is one of my faves.   I also liked the fries pretty well.  I definitely want to go back and try some of the other burgers.  But I am going to go on a Wednesday or something at some off time so that the service can be less frantic and forgetful and sllooooooooowwwwww.  3 stars because the food was A-OK and I hope that the other issues will get better.  Plus they have a kick ass patio for summer months, so I am SURE I'll be back for that.",Pour House,6157365727,1027 reviews,2013-01-20,"Nashville, TN",/biz/pour-house-nashville-2,3.0,129,"Washington, DC",Nickie G.

"730 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Hubby and I had dinner here Saturday when he was craving a good burger.  We had been running errands all afternoon, and the line at The Pharmacy in East Nashville was its typical craziness, so we decided to head home.As we were stopped at the red light on 8th, I looked over at the very interesting looking two story vastness that is The Pour House, and I said a place that large that is obviously a beer garden has got to have a good burger.  I was right.It was early evening, so the garage doors were all up and diners were happily basking in the patio areas and the dining room enjoying a nice breeze.  The hostess promptly seated us at a booth indoors (our preference) where it almost felt like we were outdoors, too.  Cool.The bar opposite our booth is U-shaped, and with the doors up, you feel like you are in a beach town filming a commercial for Margaritaville or something.  The way they have arranged the bar and the display of liquors, the lighting, and the in/out of it all is just cool.We were greeted prompt enough by our server, and since we're not beer people, ordered a tea and a water while we looked over the menu.  I ordered the ""Ol South"" ($11) burger - OMG.  The thing was like 10 ft tall... it's a Colossal onion ring (and they do mean colossal), topped with a fried green tomato, then a burger topped with pimento cheese, a fried egg, then lettuce and tomato.  No human on earth could stretch their mouth that wide, so I disassembled an enjoyed basically two appetizers with a great onion ring coated in a super yummy beer batter, a good fried green tomato, then a good burger as well.I love the fact that you can opt for sweet potato fries and no additional charge, I've never understand why so many places charge a premium for that.  Their SP fries are good, on the thicker/chewier side as opposed to crunchy.  Our server happily accomodated my request for honey mustard with the SP fries, and it was good, too, - on the balsamic/poppyseed/vinegar feel side, not syrupy sweet.Hubby had a regular bacon cheeseburger with normal fries which he enjoyed as well.  He did not offer me a bite, so that tells you something.Was it the best burger we've ever eaten?  No, but my favorite list of burgers only includes about 3 places in Middle TN.  Was it good?  Yes.  Ditto on the fries.  We really liked the feel of the place... the decor is interesting, booths comfortable, open-air is great.  And it's big.... so the waits are not long and they can handle a lot.  Great stage for live music, so that's a plus, too.There was a huge birthday party near us with tables together for like 20, including three toddlers that entertained us all climbing on the stage... too cute.The offer free valet parking if you need it, we just parked on the street, but good to know.  In short, while I'm not a ""beer person,"" I don't see why so many yelpers are fussing so much about The Pour House.

It took them another 30 minutes to bring out half of our table's food and the other half did not get their food until our half had finished eating our food.I would never go back to this place, even though it's only 4 minutes from my apartment, to me, it might as well not exist.",Pour House,6157365727,28 reviews,2013-04-29,"San Diego, CA",/biz/pour-house-nashville-2,1.0,129,"Washington, DC",Catherine D.
"730 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Went around 10pm on Saturday so it was already very crowded. I was surprised to hear the people in front of mention that they had reservations. They had a crowd of about 10 people, but this place did not seem like one you would make reservations for, or one that would take them. Inside it was crowded and there was a loud, mediocre band so we went upstairs and sat at the patio bar. It was a nice night, so it was pleasant sitting under the fan. Was really feeling like a frozen drink to accompany the warm night, but was informed they don't make them. The margarita on the rocks was typical mix margarita, but it packed a punch. The turkey burger was decent; the side of fries was small. The whole thing looked like someone had pitched it into the basket from a distance. Still - hadn't eaten lunch, so it hit the spot and soaked up the tequila.To me, The Pour House is a place to go for Happy Hour with a large group, like your softball team. You can get a small group in other places that are nicer with better food. The music was a bit on the metal side, but wasn't too loud to talk over. Also, I feel like their booze menu is best suited to fall or winter, since it is all about bourbon and whiskey, which seem like cool weather liquors. Of course, I'm not a great judge since I don't drink bourbon. Can't stand it - was the first liquor I ever drank and, well, you know how that story ends.",Pour House,6157365727,78 reviews,2013-08-07,"Nashville, TN",/biz/pour-house-nashville-2,3.0,129,"Washington, DC",Diana S.

"730 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Although there is always room for improvement, I did not experience the bad service that others have mentioned in their reviews.  There were 20 or so of us taking up an entire corner of the dining area, and we were provided with two dedicated servers who were all smiles and fast on their feet, almost too fast. If you're slow to respond, they're on to the next person while you make up your mind. I DO NOT see that as a bad thing.Everyone enjoyed the large selection of beers, and I found another stout that I enjoyed. That's always a good thing! Hmmm, am I beginning to sound like a drunk???The fried green tomatoes are good for commercially grown, but could have been more flavorful. The burgers we ate were very good, and all of the deserts were amazing!  The one downside to the menu was the sweet potatoe fries which were soggy and tasteless.  No place gets everything right, right??? When I had originally looked at the prices upon arrival, they seemed high to me, but when we got our cheque, I was shocked that we had drunk 4 beers, had two burgers, an appetizer and a desert, and the total was still under $50 including tip!  AND they hadn't left anything off!

"730 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Is it possible to give a place ZERO stars? Let me start by pointing out that my average rating is often very high and I tend to avoid writing nasty things about local establishments, even when they deserve it. However, my latest experience at Pour House was so abysmal, it is my Yelp Elite duty to share it with you. My first visit to Pour House with Marcia M. earned three stars. I was unimpressed, but willing to give it some time to grow since it was early in their opening. However, it seems things have only gone downhill since that first visit. Last Saturday night, a friend and I were on the hunt for a new atmosphere and casual place to grab a drink before heading out. My friend hadn't yet been to this new place on 8th Avenue and it seemed like a good idea. After having to move our car twice to find an area where it wouldn't be towed, we realized we should have cut our losses then and found a better solution. But, we like to take risks I guess, so we ventured on. Once inside the formaldehyde-smelling restaurant - seriously, this place has an odor that makes me wish I could cuddle up for hours in Red Door's smoke infestation - we found a spot at the bar. There's no drink menu, so the ordering process is kind of a crap shoot - and crap it was! They opened a tab for me and set my debit card in a small cup near the POS. After we choked down our drinks and tried to pretend the smell wasn't giving us a headache, we asked the unfriendly, unhelpful bartender to close our tabs. After a few minutes of her shuffling through the THREE (count 'em, three) cards in the cup, she turned to ask me if she had taken my card. Indeed she did only moments before (Hello, remember?!?! Idiot!).  As she continued to lazily look around the bar area, I did a little research to find that my debit card had been charged another amount. You're following correctly... they closed someone else's tab on my debit card and sent them on their way with it. A result I don't blame the customer, who may have not noticed, for but rather the Einstein's behind the bar. The bartender called her manager over, who was equally as unhelpful and unapologetic. He offered to void the transaction that they charged (UMMM, you think?!?! Duh!!!).  Meanwhile, the at-fault bartender handed me and my friend our ticket for the drinks. Seriously? The manager quickly disappeared into the back and it was up to me to find a solution. I grabbed a piece of paper and pen and wrote my number on it, ""call me if the customer comes back in with my card please,"" I told the bartender. I then took a separate piece of paper, not trusting that she'd actually remember what had happened at all in 5 minutes, and asked to see the manager. He came out from the back and I told him the same thing. He said he'd call if it turned up - although he's done nothing to apologize or even check in. I never heard from them, so I had to close my debit card and sat at home for a week waiting for it to arrive. (Awesome.) And here's the best part: they never voided the transaction - at least not the one they charged to my card. I was expected to pay for another customer's tab? I don't think so. This is single handily the worst experience I've had in Nashville to date, and needless to say, I will not be back. Final note: I understand things happen and mistakes are made, but the way it was handled - not to mention the disgusting food and drink selection - has me hoping this place is gone as quickly as it went up.",Pour House,6157365727,44 reviews,2013-02-11,"Nashville, TN",/biz/pour-house-nashville-2,1.0,129,"Washington, DC",Chris V.
"730 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"My wife and I joined two other couples here last week.  As others have written, the service was terrible.  I had to ask for a whiskey list three times.  The wrong drinks were brought; the burgers were indeed overcooked, even though I asked for mine to be ""on the lower side of medium.""  As someone else said, the basics are there for a great place.  The location is good; the layout with the open air feeling is excellent.  The service just mucks it up.  It is like they are making everything up as they go along.  I wanted to want to return, but I just don't.  If they ever get their act together, it will be a nice place for drinks and bar food.Positives: On a bright note, the deep fried pickles and peppers were good, as far as those things go.  Also, our waitress was friendly and wanted to be helpful.  She blamed the bad service on the bar, and to be honest, I think that was legitimate.

"730 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Like others, I was wondering what they were building for all those months in front of Frugal MacDoogal's. I'm also wondering why more businesses don't put up some kind of ""coming soon"" sign while they are being built. Before I get too far along, I want to explain my rating. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars. Since they are new (and hopefully improving), I went with a 4, but my rating might have also been inspired a little by the round of Woodford Reserve Four Wood bourbon my friend bought us!A couple of guys in our group do enjoy their bourbons and they were the main reason we ended up here. When we are out, they will order typically want something fancy like Blanton's while I'm happy with Jim Beam or a beer. Everyone in our group likes burgers though, and we agree that the food was good, not the best ever but not bad. My cheeseburger was big and cooked right and the sweet potato fries were tasty. The environment is very nice and the beer and sprits selections are impressive. Didn't take long to get service once we seated ourselves, but we were so loud it was probably hard to ignore us.

The buns on the burgers were perfect. Sturdy enough to hold the burger, but soft enough that they did not overwhelm. We had onion rings and house-made chips for the sides. Both good. Nothing to write home about, though. They should include some kind of dipping sauce - that would kick it up a notch. I agree with others that there should be a bourbon menu. It's too hard to squint up at the bottles and try to figure out what is what. Plus, I'd like some indication of cost. Service was very friendly and prompt.

On average, we didn't see our server for 20 minutes at a time. In fact, someone else delivered our food each time - appetizer, entrees, and dessert. All but one of us received the wrong drink altogether at least once. Several of the items that we tried ordering were not available, but the server wasn't proactive about helping us choose an alternative - instead we volleyed until something was available.The food was just ok. The fries, both the regular and sweet potato, looked more like home-style hash browns, but obviously weren't and were instead just poor food preparation. The sliders - meh.

"730 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"This place is great, especially for one only open for a few months.  I've experienced nothing but friendly and accommodating wait/bar staff, great valet guys, and a fun atmosphere. Also, if you haven't been to the upstairs bar, it's got a great little vibe to it separate from the main restaurant (although it only has a limited food and drink menu, its still more than many places) and looks out over downtown.1. As for parking complaints - I don't get it.  Parking is a premium around there, many of the other establishments DO tow around there (I've witnessed it twice now), and so you pay a buck or two to know your car won't be towed, and you're dropped off at the door - nice I say. You can still try and park w/o valet - good luck, seems silly and risky to me.2. They DO have drink menus, including all bourbons, etc.  If you don't see one - ASK, I'm sure they will oblige. Like any restaurant, even the products they purchase are discontinued or changing constantly, so there may be a few items listed no longer available, and some not listed - big deal.3. I've personally never had any issue with the food being cooked properly, but it is concerning that it has apparently happened, but I do believe this place would work endlessly to make sure all is sorted out. As for pre-cooking and pre-preparing food...I don't believe that at all, my food has never been there ""too fast"", but always seems just about the right time, and was always fresh and hot.You know, there are many places I love where I've had bad experiences on the off occasion: it's a fluid entity with lots of separate moving parts, and it is impossible to protect and cover them all.  From working at some of the nicest restaurants and bars in Nashville and Chicago, and having many friends who are servers, bartenders, owners, etc., I can tell you this place is doing great for being open for just over 4 months now, and it is getting better each time I go. Summertime there is going to be superb fun with all the outdoor bars and seating they have.  Go with some friends and relax and have a good time.

It's a nice, open space with lots of natural light during the day and a warm, lively feel in the evenings. I can't speak to the whole menu because I've eaten a burger both times (reasonably priced, great size, and good flavor), though what I've had has been really tasty.  The fried pickles and peppers put a spicy twist on a Nashville staple!  The beer selection is nothing special, but it's fine -- the bourbon flights are the real deal.

"730 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"OK, I have been looking for a good burger place. I live near Burger Up, Athens, and M.L. Rose and while I have eaten at all of them more than once and some more than a hundred and once (Athens), So my first experience went like this...7 pm on a Friday, I chose to sit at the bar in order to get ""quicker' service. I wanted to be impressed and delighted....10 minutes later I was finally asked if I wanted a drink.I made another mistake and ordered the Turkey/Avocodo Burger, came highly recommended, but it came very over cooked and the fries were cool. There were two ladies sitting next to us that introduced themselves and asked how we liked it and if we had been there before. Turns out that one of them was the wife of one of/ the owners. We found that out about 30 secs before I had to kill a bug crawling on my plate. OK it was a small bug, about the size of a gnat, but he didn't try to fly away either. These ladies saw the whole thing and asked if I needed a ""new plate"". I also did not have my drink refilled in a timely manner.Tonight I gave them a second chance. We went earlier 5.45pm on a Saturday. Started off rocky with a 10 minute wait at the hostess stand without so much as a recognition, with only 60% of the tables seated. We were finally acknowledged and seated but our 3rd person had to literally park a 1/2 mile away due to the poor parking availability. Thankfully, the food was MUCH better this time. I even stepped out and ordered something way out of the ordinary, the Big South, it had a fried egg, an onion ring, and even some pimento cheese. It was delicious, cooked perfectly, though the sweet potato fries were cool again. : (I know they are a whiskey kind of place, so I asked for a drink menu, the don't have one, I asked for their best selling drink which contains a good whiskey but not just straight up, the waitress didn't have any suggestions. I will go again, probably for lunch since the dinner environment is all that, and hopefully get better service (with warm fries), and skip the alcohol, since the whiskey sour was nothing to write home about and weak, and the Jack and Coke tasted like it contained Diet Coke, and that is a ""bar foul"".",Pour House,6157365727,50 reviews,2013-01-12,"Nashville, TN",/biz/pour-house-nashville-2,3.0,129,"Washington, DC",Zoraida K.

Our waitress was not familiar with the items on the menu and she was not attentive. We ordered burgers, cheeseburger, blue cheese burger and three bean burger. My burger was dry and overcooked. Yet, the three bean burger was outstanding and melted in my mouth. Our daughter loved the cheeseburger and sweet potato fries. The atmosphere was great. (The heating regulated ).

I decided to go with their Cuban Burger and I think I just found my new favorite. My friends had the Black and Blue Burger and the Portobello Cap Burger, they were both equally impressed. Beer and Bourbon selection as always is impressive. The drink specials and live music are a plus.

"5133 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Excellent breakfast place.  It's located in a strip mall that has some tight parking spots, so when it gets busy on the weekends, parking can be a bit of a problem, although there is additional parking nearby.  The staff is pretty friendly.  The food here is simply amazing.  It's pretty much strictly a breakfast/brunch place (and they close early) but they are really good at it.  I didn't even know what basted eggs were before I found this place, but I love them now.  Even the potato bites that come with it are good.  The veggie omelet was also very good, and the eggs bendict is delicious.  I don't think I've eaten here once and not liked the food much.  I also tend to stick to the foods that I know I'll like, so I haven't sampled too many choices from the menu, even though I've been here numerous times.  The prices are very reasonable for the good food IMO.  An order of say Eggs Benedict is pretty filling in itself, so you don't really have to order an appetizer and an entree of sorts to actually feel full here.  The coffee however isn't that great, and seems pretty plain.  They do have some fresh juices but I haven't tried them out in the morning. I took of one star mainly because they seem to have a bit of a backward policy in not taking on the phone take out orders on the weekends.  The weekend is when this place is very busy with almost all the tables are taken and there is a good waiting period as well.   This would seem like the ideal time where they can take orders on the phone so people can get the food and go eat somewhere else.  I understand that this most likely has to do with the staff being over-worked at a busy time, but that just indicates that the place is understaffed then.  I've tried to go  here numerous times on the weekends only to be discouraged by the waiting period and go elsewhere, but would've ordered take out over the phone if I didn't have to wait.  I would recommend the food here to anyway, so so on the coffee, and wish they would chance their weekend policies on take out.",Le Peep,6153530030,50 reviews,2014-02-02,"Nashville, TN",/biz/le-peep-nashville,4.0,91,"Washington, DC",Alvin P.

"5133 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Le Peep was tasty! My friend and I drove to Belle Meade after browsing the menu online and seeing the delicious looking photos on Yelp. Le Peep is located in a strip mall, and there are some weird restrictions on parking; some spaces said 60 minute maximum parking, others said 30. Not sure the deal there but there was a garage close by though it would be a bit of a hassle to get there if you've already driven in the parking lot.We made it in about 30 minutes before they closed (at 2pm) and ordered the crab cake benedict and dawn breaker. The dawn breaker was a scramble with mushrooms, bacon, tomatoes, cheese, and onions. My benedict was very large and was too much to eat in one setting. I asked if I could add spinach on my dish, and the waiter told me it would be no problem. Hey, I like additions at no charge! After I'd had half of my meal and my side potatoes I was full and took the rest to go. The dawn breaker was the perfect portion; just enough food. Our potatoes were a bit dry and had been sitting out for a bit, but we did come in close to closing and they were definitely winding down the food service, so I don't want to give them too much heat and they still tasted good. Our coffee was awesome and they have a giant orange juicer that I'm sure makes amazing mimosas!

Apparently it's a chain restaurant and their menu reflects that immediately. They're doing dozens of things, which makes me question how many of them they do really well. I got the Farmer's Benedict, which swaps out the normal English muffin for a biscuit, Canadian bacon for sausage patties, and Hollandaise sauce for sausage gravy. It was good, no doubt. No complaints whatsoever on that. I can't remember what my girlfriend got but I'm pretty sure she was happy with it as well. And they had freshly squeezed orange juice that was good too. As I'm writing this review, I really want to give Le Peep 4 stars but there was something about it that just makes me say it was A-OK instead of being a vocal fan of the place. I think part of the issue is that it's in the this awkward spot in a little strip mall that's fairly out of the way. I remember the interior of the restaurant being pretty uninspiring as well.

"5133 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"I recalled reviews for this place being on the higher side, but I wasn't impressed with my experience.  I don't remember what my dish was, but it had plain egg whites, oatmeal, and peasant potatoes.  I also had a mimosa, and my husband had the crab cakes benedict.  I don't think much/anything here is homemade, but rather comes to them already prepared/frozen.  I thought the potatoes were fine, but my husband really dislikes that kind of food, so he didn't enjoy his.  He also didn't like his crab cakes, although they were fine to me.  I'm a big oatmeal eater, but theirs was really not good.  I also didn't enjoy the mimosa.Upon entering the restaurant, I was excited because there aren't many diners in Nashville, and I miss that, coming from NYC.  I will probably stick with places like Athens, where everything is homemade, and the occasional Noshville (on Elliston!), if I want to pay NYC prices.",Le Peep,6153530030,55 reviews,2012-06-10,"Nashville, TN",/biz/le-peep-nashville,3.0,91,"Washington, DC",Emily E.

"5133 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"This was my first visit to Le Peep as I met a colleague for a breakfast discussion.  I was initially taken back by the parking situation whereby parking in front of the establishment is limited to 30 minutes and longer duration guests are asked to park in the downstairs garage. This was standard practice for all businesses located on site.The interior is clean, bright and comfortable.  Seating was the standard table & chairs affair with no booths. The menu is quite extensive with healthy options and good 'ol Southern cuisine as well. Service was quick, attentive, friendly and accurate. The orange juice is freshly squeezed and served in a reasonable quantity.  I ordered the Homestead breakfast and it arrived promptly.  It was prepared as ordered and had tasty seasonings that added to the dining experience.  It was clear that the biscuits were not fresh out of the oven but they were not stale either.

I got there at 9:30, and there was already a crowd. Fortunately, my friend had arrived a few minutes earlier and had already gotten us a table. No wait= yay!It was difficult to decide among the myriad of yummy sounding options. I ordered the Eighteen Wheeler (French toast, poached eggs, peasant potatoes, & bacon) because I wanted a little of everything. It arrived about 20-25 minutes later and was overall thumbs up! The only thing that bugged me was that the poached eggs were runny.  From previous reviews, I was also highly anticipating the Peasant potatoes. They are just crispy little home fries. Good but I thought they'd be more creatively prepared with cheese, veggies, etc.The French toast was quite good, and the bacon was killer! Thick, crispy, and mmmmmmm! It was just a cheerful plate of goodness to complement a good conversation.Be prepared to pay about $13-15 for an entree and drink= a little steep for brunch but worth it.

"5133 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"You mean, Le Yum! The food here was pretty tasty. Not that it was some spectacular miracle to make a good breakfast sandwich, but the bagel was perfect (even if they only offer them in plain), the eggs were delicious, and the avocado (which I requested in place of bacon) came in heaps and was super ripe and fresh tasting. My favorite part was the potatoes, which were perfectly salted and not overly greasy.My boyfriend got a skillet, which was a delicious combo of cheese, potatoes, peppers, onions and basted egg, which I'd never heard of, but would get that next time...because it was a party in my mouth. Now to the negatives...The service, while good, was not really something to write home (or yelp reviews) about. The waitress brought everything out without error, but when I ordered a diet coke, she brought me out a carafe of watered down soda and a glass with ice in it. Pour yourself some soda that's been sitting in ice since we opened, it screamed. Not what I was looking for, but okay. I wasn't going to complain about a little soda when it was 10:30am and I just wanted food. But then, the waitress leaves the bill on the table without telling us to pay up front, so we all sat there staring at each other for about 10 minutes before realizing what was happening. Again, not a huge deal, but like I said, neither was the service. I would go back to try some delicious pancakes/french toast/pastry style breakfast, since I saw the reviews for that were far better than my generic ""A-OK"" rating. All in all, not bad...

I ordered the chicken crepe, where the chicken, mushrooms, broccoli and tomatoes were actually diced and mixed with the hollandaise and piled atop the crepe itself. Not what I was expecting, but still delicious. I cleaned my plate, which doesn't happen often. Service was acceptable, nothing special, and they didn't mention we should pay at the desk up front.

The coffee wasn't the best...I kind of expected better quality of taste. I ordered the Spanish Omelette (""Filled with combo cheese, onions, green chilies, smothered with salsa and a dollop of sour cream and chives."") and ordered the hashbrown equivalent and my choice of an english muffin. I was attempting to recreate the same meal I had in Arizona. It half way succeeded, but to be fair, I cannot compare the two restaurants.Le Peep was very good and lots of food for the price. I think my meal was around $8.50. The atmosphere was lively and loud, but I don't mind that. I actually prefer that.

The peasant potatoes/home fries/hash-browns, normally a brunch afterthought, were the best things on both of our plates. The sausage links were terrible imposters. The weird, light tan/grey color was the first clue that all was not well in the land of Le Peep.  Words fail me as I try to describe how bad this stuff was. I think they tried to pass some poultry sausage off on me, but the menu said ""sausage"" and ,by god, PORK sausage is what I expected and deserved. Even by poultry sausage standards (an oxymoron, in my opinion) it was awful. Truly evil cased meat.The scrambled eggs had an odd sheen to them. I have my doubts if they were really eggs at all. (Note to Le Peep: Eggs come from chickens. Sausage does not.) In a vain attempt to render the egg-type-substance edible, I asked for a little salsa. I hope they don't go to the trouble of making it in house (sincerely doubted), but they really should stop. Pace salsa from aisle 3 at Super Walmart is far superior in every demonstrable way. Glad I had a side of pancakes. They were not as good as even IHOP or Cracker Barrel, but at least they afforded me the opportunity to rid my palate of the vile taste of the sausage/egg/salsa offenses.

"5133 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"This was the first place I ever tried Eggs Florentine. I had always loved Eggs Benedict, but oh, the genius of replacing the ham with spinach! Le Peep is nowhere near as pretentious as it sounds and the menu is not really French at all, just classic brunch. The portions are huge, so it's a perfect place to soak up a good hangover, especially as they have a full bar, so mimosas with your eggs are a distinct possibility. Beware that on Saturdays, it will be packed and Sundays are a bizarre mix of hungover 20 and 30 somethings and the church crowd (just look around to see who's drinking, and/or wearing sunglasses). On either weekend day, you'll have to wait a good thirty minutes or so, so come prepared to do that, but the turnover is relatively quick and the food is worth it.",Le Peep,6153530030,357 reviews,2008-09-28,"Nashville, TN",/biz/le-peep-nashville,4.0,91,"Washington, DC",Claire B.
"5133 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"My friend Jonny loves, loves, loves breakfast food. My mother never was one to make big breakfasts (Pop-Tarts were more the norm), so I had to warm up to the place, but man, what a tasty and filling brunch spot. It was one of the first places Jonny took me to introduce me to Nashville, and we would go there almost every week after church. I usually get one of the skillets that are potatoes covered with eggs, cheese, veggies, and other great stuff. Definitely try one of those -- the Gypsy, the Wanderer -- trust me, you can't go wrong. They also have lighter fare, like the White Lightning made with egg whites. Also worth a mention are the Gooey Buns as a starter -- english muffins topped with cream cheese and apples; a wonderful treat. They also bring you your own carafe of coffee so you can drink as much as you like. And, if you're not a huge breakfast fan, there are other choices.My only complaint would be how crowded it gets and the service can be a little spotty. The food makes it all worth the wait, though.

"5133 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",3.5,Le Peep may be a chain but it's one of the better places in Nashville to go for brunch or breakfast. The food is delicious and they have about every breakfast food you can think of (sans veggie meats) on the menu. They also have a ton of drink options and full espresso bar. There were only 2 things about this place that less than thrilled me. 1. The coffee was terrible.  2. The service was pretty rotten as well... and it was a slow day. There were about 3 different people who helped us and only one of them more than once. I was not too impressed with either of those aspects but I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that it was just an off day.

"2535 Franklin PikeNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"Remember that time you first looked at the massive Princeton Review book of colleges and thought, ""There is no way I am ever going to read all this""?That is how I feel whenever I see the Koi sushi menu. Don't get me wrong--I love variety. I especially love variety when it is delicious. However, handed the giant tome that contains the many sushi options (and their pictures), I often find myself giving up after the first five pages. Or worse, I make it all the way to the end, and realize that I have forgotten which item I chose somewhere in the first three pages. Luckily, the search is always worth it, because Koi has some of the best sushi in Nashville. The salmon is fresh, the tempura is light and crispy, and the fruit is ripe. Whatever I end up ordering out of the epic book o' sushi, I am always satisfied by the portion sizes and the taste.Now, part of my satisfaction may stem from the hunger I experience after waiting in the seemingly endless food desert that is the restaurant's dining room. A typical meal here takes about an hour and a half; if you are truly rushing, plan on an hour.

I also love the garlic and ginger sauce chicken, and the soy sauce noodles.The only downside: I love spicy dishes, but the spiciness is never consistent. Once I ordered a level 3 spicy dish and it had no spice, and another time I ordered no spice and it cleared my sinuses. But I usually ask for the spice tray and it makes everything all better.I've seen this restaurant go from no customers about a year ago to a packed house.

"2535 Franklin PikeNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"So the quest for great Pho in Nashville continued today. Growing weary thinking that I wasn't going to find a phenomenal bowl of this steamy goodness. I decided to give Koi a try after seeing Will M's review. I was quite excited that finally my quest successful at this restaurant. I walked in to the restaurant and the host asked how many people(1), he then said to sit wherever...  Why ask? He then came over with my menu and asked what I would like to drink. Upon asking what beers they had, he sighed, and told me to wait a minute while he got the drink menu. When he came back he tossed the menu down on the table while saying their inside... At this point I was about to leave but the Pho was calling to me from the kitchen like a Siren.For the rest of the meal I had two different people come by my table to take care of my food. These guys were courteous, happy, and understood customer service. Not sure where the first guy disappeared to but I was happy for the vanishing act.My spicy yellowtail rolls came out and were tasty but in no way spicy. The Pho on the other hand came to the table and it was like there was a party in my olfactory. The aroma surrounded me and I could barely wait to finish my last roll and dive in. Before putting anything into the broth I decided to try it. It was as full in taste as it was in smell. After adding the bean sprouts, a few basil leaves, and jalapenos I dug in to a greatest bowl of Pho I have had in Nashville. Despite the horrible first impression I left with a smile and I was quite full. It was a bit pricy compared to a lot of the places I go for Pho but worth it.",Koi Sushi & Thai,6159426208,93 reviews,2013-01-03,"Nashville, TN",/biz/koi-sushi-and-thai-nashville,4.0,97,"Washington, DC",Justin M.

I was in Nashville for work and we had just picked up a few coworkers at the airport and we were all starving.

We were doing a U-Turn and saw this place and figured what the heck, so we parked and went on in.     It is very small, but cute. We were greeted right away and given menus. My co-worker's boyfriend actually ordered Sushi. He thought it was a bit pricey for the amount he was given, but said it was tasty.

"2535 Franklin PikeNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"Solid 3.5 stars.I first tried Koi this week. Despite my temptation to ditch my dinner plans and spend my night getting sloshed at M.L. Rose next door, I knew the pretty girl waiting for me at Koi would be perturbed.Little did I know that in addition to Sapporo and the usual beer selection, Koi also has a score of rotating microbrews. Score! That gave me something delicious to sip on as I pored over the menu--which is absurdly long. I settled on...drumroll please...sushi and Thai.On the sushi side of the menu, the portions are substantial. The hunks of tuna on the nigiri were gynormous, and the rolls are similarly large--although the speciality rolls have speciality prices. I got a spicy tuna roll and found it to be an average value for the price.For my Thai food, I tried a cup of the tom kha soup, which was OK but not spectacular. If Koi management is reading this, you definitely need more galangal and kaffir lime leaves in the soup to make it more authentic. I also ordered the pad kra prow (basil chicken) and asked for it to be prepared 5/5 spicy, and while I personally would have liked it spicier, I think what I got is at the upper end of most people's tolerances. The flavor was reasonably decent, too, and I enjoyed the leftovers the next day.Koi loses a point for authenticity. I find that to be common at many of the ""hybrid"" Thai/sushi places. When I asked for prik nam pla, which is the Thai name for bird chills in fish sauce (THE most popular condiment in Thai food), the waitress stared back at me blankly. When I explained that I just wanted something to spice things up, she eventually brought me some Sriacha sauce.

"2535 Franklin PikeNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"Find the best bowl of Pho in Nashville, here!  To the untrained eye, a thai and sushi place is not the ideal place, unless you are a discerning person in the know.. almost everyone that works here is vietnamese.I was very happy to hear the broth spent 2 days boiling to perfection.  The beef, sliced super thin with a meat slicer.  The bowl, was just the right size.  And the noodles, were cooked to the right texture.  Hint: the art of eating this bowl is to portion the beef when you eat.Cost was $9.56 + $2.44 tip = $12, a bit pricy If you compare to other asian communities.  I mean it's like half the price in other cities, or less.  I guess beggers can't be choosers.  Decor had some sexy colors, lots of space.  I'd get Pho, and some sushi and if you sit near the paintings, theres some cushions to lay down on if you ate too much.",Koi Sushi & Thai,6159426208,235 reviews,2012-05-11,"Chicago, IL",/biz/koi-sushi-and-thai-nashville,4.0,97,"Washington, DC",Will M.

Last visit, my wife and I went again on a quiet weeknight early.  Server was very attentive and friendly.  We were sure that this was it, and that all the kinks had been worked out.  After toasting and downing our first sake, the second pour revealed something in it.  Maybe it was a piece of red pepper, maybe it was a piece of salmon, maybe it was a piece of a finger?   Enough is enough; some things aren't meant to be. We were hopefull that we could have a great sushi place right around the corner from our house, but we are driving back across town to Sonobana, which we never should have left, and is a great place.Koi should keep it's Franklin place open as it sounds great, but as far as expansion; fail..",Koi Sushi & Thai,6159426208,44 reviews,2012-04-24,"Nashville, TN",/biz/koi-sushi-and-thai-nashville,2.0,97,"Washington, DC",A A.

We're not talking about made from scratch everything, but what they do serve is well-prepared and very flavorful. I like the spicy chicken sandwich (diced grilled chicken in a pita with hot sauce and cucumber sauce), and I really recommend the gyro fries (fries topped with gyro meat, hot sauce, and ranch dressing - make sure you get the spicy fries as the foundation for this masterpiece).CHARM - The building obviously used to be a Little Caesar's stand alone drive thru. Now, they've doctored the logo and replaced the olive wreath with a traditional king's crown.

"716 Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",4.5,"My husband and I were curious about all of these gyro joints on Gallatin. There are quite a few. Ha. Anyway this place had decent reviews so we decided to give it a go. We called ahead and ordered a falafel sandwich and catfish sandwich, both with spicy fries. We waited 15 mins and left to pick up our food. They were really busy when we pulled up and my husband stood at the window for quite some time. When he finally came to the car, he said they would have to cook the fish from frozen and it would take about 7 minutes. He just decided on a falafel sandwich instead. After driving home and eating the food, we both agreed it was decent. The spicy fries were actually kind of spicy in comparison to other places along Gallatin with spicy fries that should just be called ""seasoned fries."" The falafel sammies were good but not the best I've ever had. He said the guy at the window was friendly. But after a 25 minute total wait on a call ahead order at a semi-fast food place, we probably won't be rushing back.",King Solomon’s Gyros,6152280411,237 reviews,2015-07-30,"Nashville, TN",/biz/king-solomons-gyros-nashville,3.0,83,"Washington, DC",Ashley T.

My other friend and I were hungry, so we wandered a little ways down the road from our place and found King Solomon's Gyros. The guy who took our order was apparently the owner; he had a cast on his wrist, had just returned to work after a convalescence, and as a result was extremely, weirdly particular about what he would and would not sell us (because he hadn't been around to make sure everything was perfect, apparently). Instead, he personally made us two gyros each, off-menu barbecue style, with chicken and then lamb, so we could give him our opinion.

"716 Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",4.5,This is the best Mediterranean joint on Gallatin. Good food and good folks who run it. Get the gyro fries!,King Solomon’s Gyros,6152280411,27 reviews,2015-06-30,"Nashville, TN",/biz/king-solomons-gyros-nashville,5.0,83,"Washington, DC",Benjamin S.
"716 Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",4.5,"4.5These guys have gyros down to a science. First off, you can either walk up or drive-thru. There's no inside seating. If you walk up, you can park it on the small patio and go to town, but I've never seen anyone do that. This is a place you come to get your grub and, then, peace out. Sounds simple but get this: if there's a line, pops (or one of the older sons/nephews) sends the younger ones outside to take orders -- thereby (doing what?) KEEPING IT MOVING. You *know* what a fan I am of keeping it moving. It's part of the business model at King Solomon's. Adding to the process, everyone's incredibly nice. The younger guys are well-mannered (or, I'm old; they always call me sir). The older guys are very cool and equipped with good conversation and pops does his thing making sure that the machine keeps running.And we haven't even gotten to the food. I don't know how long King Solomon's has been here but I want to believe that it's been a little while now. And I want to believe that it's proof that Nashville's always been a food city. Yes, now the spotlight's on the city and people are looking around but, back in the day, unless you lived on the east side, people weren't clamoring to come to Greenwood to get some food... and now they are... as they should be. If you're a fan of Greek eats, come here. You'll escape with your wallet intact and your belly distended and full. While there are plenty of non-gyro options on the menu, why bother? Come here for the good stuff. Get a gyro. Now, you can get it in pita form, a plate (with yellow rice, salad, pita, and plenty of cucumber sauce), FRIES (spicy fries with gyro meat and sauce... do you hear me??!!), or a meat bomb (I have no idea what it was; one of the older guys gave it to me and told me that it's his personal go-to/invention; I just recall it was a football-sized pita full of meat and sauce and i couldn't stop eating it). If anyone at DDD had the power of reading comprehension, *this* is the sort of place it would profile but it's just as well that it doesn't. KSG is busy enough as it is. I'd hate to wait any longer for my next fix.P.S. The fries (spicy or regular) are serious. Get them topped with *something* (sauce, meat, whatever).P.P.S.

I got spicy chicken/gyro combo with ranch and spicy fries (what? I work out so I can eat like this!), the BF got the spicy chicken sandwich with spicy fries.

They quoted me 7 minutes so when I pulled up they were putting the finishing touches on it. We didn't get combos (the game is on so we would be having beer, naturally) but the happy man at the drive through almost insisted I take drinks (again worried about it being too hot for me). He was so kind and I felt he was genuinely happy to help.The food was SO YUMMY. I mean...really, it was all very good. Those spicy fries are like ""hot fries"" come to life.

We pulled up to the window and asked for recommendations since the menu was long and random and it was our first visit.  The gentleman inside asked if we liked lamb and tzatziki, and if we preferred rice or fries, then disappeared to make us each a delicious surprise meal. We ended up with one gyro platter with all the typical fixings (rice, salad, pita, etc), and one gyro wrap with fries and everything was amazing - we ended up splitting both boxes.  He also gave us a free baklava sample while we waited and handed us a jarritos soda when he opened one for himself (we didn't ask for it and he didn't charge us for it.)

And the fries (both regular and seasoned) are fantastic. The menu has a lot of options, but I see no reason to stray from the basic gyro combo. I've heard good things about the gyro sub as well.As odd as it sounds, the main reason to come here is the SERVICE. That's right - a small drive through with $6 gyro combos has standout service! The guys inside are incredibly nice, and eager to help out with refills or anything else you might need while dining outside. And the food comes out quick.Fast, helpful service; cheap; good food... what more could you want from a restaurant???",King Solomon’s Gyros,6152280411,47 reviews,2013-08-13,"Nashville, TN",/biz/king-solomons-gyros-nashville,5.0,83,"Washington, DC",Ozro D.

"716 Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",4.5,"King Solomon is top notch. The value for the food is hard to match, as the prices are low, and the food is delicious. This is a smart alternative to the plethora of chain fast food restaurants on Gallatin.Favorite dishes include the chicken hummus sandwich, combo dinner plate, and Greek salad. The yellow rice is perfect comfort food, and no order is complete without tzatziki. Given the heat as of late, as well as the less than stellar view from the picnic tables, I've opted for carryout to enjoy at home. However, it's nice to have the option to sit in front and gobble falafel when the craving strikes. I don't have experience with the drive-thru, but that seems pretty streamlined.If you're looking for inexpensive and satisfying food while painting your house, hosting a yard sale, rushing home from work, or getting messy in the garden, consider King Solomon.

I'll get on that next time because I will DEFINITELY be back soon.I have spent so long on the search for a great felafel in Nashville and have been disappointed at every turn. When I read the review of King Solomon in the Best of Nashville issue of the Scene I decided to give the place a shot, despite my hesitancy of its location (East Nash Gallatin-adjacent Greek is always friendly, but rarely tasty) and super orange exterior. I am so glad I did!The felafel sandwich was a great deal at just $3.99 and was enormous and overflowing with deliciousness. Their tzatziki had a tangy kick that perfectly complemented the crispy outside, soft and flavorful inside, felafels. It was big enough to split for 2 with a side, but I ate the whole damn thing. It was just too delicious to say no.They make everything fresh, so it's worth the wait (which is still not super long, btw). My wait was made even more pleasant by the extremely friendly man at the window Bijon (I spelled it phonetically, but I'm sure it's wrong, sorry). He passed the time with jokes and conversation.

"716 Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",4.5,"I heard about King Solomon when Nashville Scene awarded them the Best Gyro in Nashville. Naturally, I had to give them a shot.You would not randomly stumble across King Solomon. It's in a drive-thru/walk-up only building on Gallatin Road. Honestly, my personal restaurant bias would have normally kept me driving right on past a joint like this.However, the food was surprisingly good. It was also surprisingly inexpensive. For $5.99, I bought the combination platter that came with both gyro meat and chicken on a bed of yellow right with a tasty little salad mixed in. I chose the cucumber sauce, which they poured over the top of the meat in the perfect portion size. I even felt like what I ate was reasonably healthy as well, for fast food at least.I ate lunch at noon. It's not almost 6pm, and I am still full. Value, people.Normally when I buy this type of lunch, the lettuce is the stale out-of -a-bag variety, the meat is a little dry, and I feel like I have to douse everything in the tzaziki sauce to make it palatable. I was pleasantly surprised to find the meat fresh (and very tasty), while the salad was actual romaine lettuce glazed with a good vinaigrette-type dressing and fresh chopped parsley. There were slices of fresh onion, black olives and banana peppers thrown in as well. If they had only thrown in some feta, it would have been perfection.Don't be tempted to feel dubious about the neighborhood or the exterior of the building.

"1008-A Woodland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"As a native New Englander I really wanted to like this place. And I was encouraged when the Boston (???!!!) Clam Chowder not only passed the spoon test, but was served with real oyster crackers. There weren't many clams and the flavor was meh, and sadly that's where the food peaked. The clam strip basket I ordered was missing the french fries and instead of tartar sauce, it came with mayonnaise. That didn't really matter however, because the clam strips themselves had been deep fried to just short of burned. Worse, it was clear these strips were the Sea Pak brand you could buy in the frozen food section of any grocery store.But that was nothing compared to the whole clams my wife ordered, which were clearly past their expiration date. It was as if they had gone from shell to fryer without being cleaned, and tasted like they had started to spoil.Since neither of us was willing to try again on the clams, I got the meatball grinder and my wife had the coconut shrimp.

I try to avoid fried and battered things, and I just didn't have much desire to visit this restaurant. BUT I am so glad that I came here with friends who have visited before and recommended it. They didn't lead me wrong. We started with the fried pickle chips...YUM! They didn't last long. Then we moved on to drinks and I had a very delicious vodka mule that was served in a copper cup. Perfection! My friends raved about the sushi, and we ordered a roll and the boys had a platter of sushi which was HUGE. The sushi was legit. And I probably never would have ordered it had my friends not said it was so good. Who knew they'd have sushi at a place called Batter'd and Fried?!

"1008-A Woodland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"3.5It's all about expectations. Who would have thought there'd be a divey New England-inspired restaurant/bar at the tip of East End? I couldn't wrap my head around the concept so I avoided it for a while. That's a mistake. For what it is, B&F is just what you'd expect and should satisfy your fried seafood needs quite nicely.Take advantage of the hot weather and sit outside on the patio. Disregard the sticky menu (remember, expectations) and start in with a beverage. Sure, you could opt for beer but the cocktails here are big and cheap (at least, they were on a Tuesday evening). The BTE cocktail was $6.50 of fruity light-headedness. I can dig it. As for the food, ya gotta keep it simple: seafood and something fried. I opted for the seafood burger and fries. The burger sounds like it should be a mess, but it works. It's a patty made up of lobster, scallops, crab, whitefish, and shrimp -- along with peppers and onions. I don't know how they did it and I didn't ask. But, that's the burger. It comes with lettuce, tomato and garlic butter. And, that's all you need. The burger is substantial, filling and scratches the seafood-loving/needing itch. The fries that come with... addicting. Who knew bay seasoning and vinegar could make potatoes so incredibly delicious? Well, you know now. Done.Paramount to enjoying your experience at B&F is setting your expectations and knowing what you're getting into. Look around: we're landlocked and in the south. That said, frying the ish outta things is almost always a hit. Get some seafood. Get something fried. Go for a big cocktail. Enjoy.

Heard about this place when it opened and I don't even think it is the same owners. The food was really very good. Oysters not in the month with a R were wonderful as were the mussels. We love mussels and hard to find a decent place in Nashville. They have fish and chips and get this 4 kinds with different names. I must be a toddler when it comes to Fish and chips, but usually the establishment says fish and chips and chooses the fish. Here they have what fish is which. They had salmon, cod, halibut and one other. Oops sorry I forgot. The Sushi rolls looked really good and nicely priced, however can't be objective because we did not have them. We had the ceviche. very good too. I had the unfiltered Sake, miss that from bigger cities, but Nashville is coming on board with having almost anything. The wine also was fairly prices. Finally, but I did not partake, the fries. The FRIES!!! They came in a bag so you could put malt vinegar in them. ohhhh so wish I could have eaten more, but was totally full from the Oysters, mussels and ceviche and Sake. Wish I could go back soon. Worth a try. Service was very good, bathrooms were clean and bartender and staff were quite helpful. There is a deck too. Looked like fun and those out there looked happy.

"1008-A Woodland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I'm conflicted on this one, because it looks like they could use some more 4 star reviews, but I'm going to go with three for now in hopes the owner sees this and makes some necessary changes to get 4, or even 4.5 stars, because this place can do it.I sat in the bar after a Titans game and waited for a friend that was caught in traffic, and the bartender/waiter was very patient with me and had no qualms with me taking a 4 top so I could comfortably unload my motorcycle helmet and jacket (It wasn't too busy or I would never have done that as I know how annoying it can be).  The service was great.  Your staff seem friendly and good at their jobs.  Hold onto them.It could possibly help you hold onto them if you provided a decent bathroom.  I don't know if you're going for a freezing cold, warped walled, Boston dive bar motif here, but that's what you have - and it's nasty, and it makes you question the cleanliness behind the scenes.The place needs a little more vibe.  All you would have had to do was put some volume on one of the 2 football games on.The food.  Your fried shrimp is perfect.  I'm not really a coconut guy, but when I saw my roommates order I had to try it because it's kinda rare that you see that perfect amount of breading with that slightly oily glow.  They were really good.  The fries were really good, too.  The sushi - the sushi waaaaas.... a good deal.  I got two $7 rolls and they were tasty enough.  The spicy tuna roll and the philly roll.  As I went to the gross, freezing cold bathroom I passed by the sushi case and I would have to say that the fish is probably just fine, but not top notch.  The tuna had that dyed look to it where it's slightly too pink.  It makes it so I probably wouldn't venture into the $13-$15 rolls.  Also, you did have one IPA on tap, and while I'd love a plethora to choose from, I've come to accept and be thankful for just one here in the south, so you get a pass on that.  OHHH, the clam chowder.  You actually can stick a spoon up in it, and I have to admit, it was one of the better ones I've had, and adding some pepper, or salt, or Tobasco, or oyster crackers didn't make it any better.  I tried each individually and straight up was the way to go for me.So in this day and age when people are tighter with their cash, and care more about where they are dining out, please just make a little more effort to stand out, and places like this will topple the giant corporations serving crap processed foods and overcharging for it.",Batter’d & Fried Boston Seafood House,6152269283,221 reviews,2014-01-02,"Nashville, TN",/biz/batterd-and-fried-boston-seafood-house-nashville,3.0,174,"Washington, DC",Andy B.

"1008-A Woodland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Decided to check this place out on a whim early Saturday evening with my boyfriend and my brother. This place is literally right next to Five Points Pizza, so the parking situation is the same. There is a paid lot across the street and it's $3.00 for 2 hours (the machine accepts credit cards). Convenient, but annoying at the same time.This place has a Boston theme to it, but when I was looking around I noticed it pretty much only had stuff for the Red Sox. I think another reviewer noted this, and it didn't necessarily bother me but just an observation. They did have some pretty cool memorabilia though, so I can appreciate that. Our server (can't remember his name now) was nice enough, but definitely not one of those above and beyond experiences.We sat really close to the sushi preparation area, but none of us decided to go that route. Just seems a little bit odd considering the type of restaurant. We decided to order the pickle chips first. They were sliced sweet pickles, which really threw me off. Every other time I've had them at other places, they've been dill pickles. So the taste was a little strange at first, but it wasn't terrible. Just not what I'm used to. My boyfriend also got the clam chowder, which I was able to try, and it was actually really good. It came out super thick (I was expecting something a little more soup-like) but had a really good flavor to it.My boyfriend and I went with the fish and chips, and my brother got the Polish sausage. I don't really understand why they put the fries in a paper bag, because you're just going to dump them out anyway... But they did have the malt vinegar to put on the fries, which were excellent. The fish was cooked really well, and the breading was very light and not too greasy. I got 3 pieces but I wish I knew how big they were before I ordered. They were massive! (not a bad thing of course) But if I would have known that, I probably would have opted for 1 or 2 pieces. My brother commented that the Polish sausage tasted like a hot dog. Not sure if that's what they were going for or what exactly happened.Overall, this is a pretty decent place. The food was fairly good, service was fairly good. But there wasn't anything that was spectacular or over the top amazing, which is why I stuck with the 3 stars on this one.

"1008-A Woodland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Over the years of going to Batter'd & Fried, I have experienced a variety of different wait staff, management, chefs etc. Every meal there has a completely different story.....I'll attempt to make this short & sweet, and start from the beginning. My first time (09') I met some old friends there for a 1/2 price Oyster deal they had. Oysters seemed ""fresh"" and the drinks were really good. I had no issue recommending this place to friends or committing to returning in the near future. My next experience was for a birthday dinner (party of 8-10) and the overall opinion of dinner was mediocre at best. I had the Sushi and everyone else had Fish & Chips or something in the ""fried"" realm. I've returned numerous times between 2010-2013 with no real ""stand out"" moments. Food was ok, drinks not as great, beer options seemed to be lacking. I could start to see this was not the same Batter'd & Fried I loved in the beginning. My last two experiences (both in 2014) would prove to be my last. Once again, I ordered Sushi and my other half opted for Fish & Chips. Mine was edible, though it seemed like the quality had gone down. The Fish & Chips were horrible and sent back to be replaced by chicken in hopes that would be different. One word.....dry.

Plus the card reader had caked food on it as did the malt vinegar bottle at my table. I was there for lunch and it was slow so the serving staff needs to not chat so much and actually clean their stations. More time on station prep and presentation would get more stars and a relaxed brow seeing as mine is cocked in skepticism for the meal I'm about to be served.The Menu: overlong and misleading. Will refer to that later. Far too many things on the menu so instantly this suggests to me that there isn't a lot of focus on specializing.Food: two stars the fish was tender and the breading crispy and light. It wasn't at all oily. However, there needed to be more seasoning. Maybe I was expecting too much seeing as the menu said they used Lawry's seasoning. Me thinks the cook haveth a light hand. Without the sauce, the fish would've been tasteless. The ""chips"" we're bog standard frozen thick cut. Not at all fresh. The icing on the cake was the 99¢ cole slaw in what seemed to be a slightly large sauce cup. Seriously, a head of cabbage is 99¢. The cheeky buggers...Service: Four stars...

We all ordered fried seafood dinners, except for my mom who got the seafood pasta with alfredo sauce. The pasta was ok, as was the rest of the dinner. Not horrible by any means, but there's just only so much fried seafood one can take before feeling like you're going to get sick. So yes, the portions are fairly large, although half of the big plate is taken up by french fries. I'm the type of person that goes and order the least ordinary stuff, so I got the fried clam belly while hubby got the fried salmon plate. The fried clam belly tasted like oysters, but fishier. I'm usually ok with fishy-tasting stuff, but it just got to be too much after 3 bites. Salmon, on the other hand, just slightly better. At least I don't feel like I'm going to throw up, but salmon is just not meant to be fried. The fish was dry and just not that appetizing. Overall, it was kinda of a disappointment.

"1008-A Woodland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"My family and I have been going here for years. The quality of food and service has definitely gone down a lot. In my most recent trip I got the grilled chicken salad. It was basically a house salad with chicken on it. The lettuce was whole pieces of romaine lettuce. Fresh but not chopped or cut whatsoever. It had store bought cheese and rock hard unripe tomatoes and chicken. The chicken was grilled with no seasoning and was barely cooked. Rubbery at best. And the salad dressing was not the one I ordered. My wife got the salmon. The fish was tasty and cooked a little past well done. The rice and broccoli were flavorless. I make way better food at home. And for $40 I was kinda pissed. The previous trip that we were there everything was fine. But we got the Chef Andys fish and chips. They seem to know how to do that and French fries well but that's about it. I do have to say their French fries are phenomenal. But the time before that I got the pub style fish and it was inedible. It made me want to vomit on the spot. The ""pub style "" is some kinda wet panko batter. The outside was crispy ant he batter was wet on the inside. Like it was still wet milk or egg wash. Like wet soggy uncooked fish wet soggy. It makes me sick thinking about it. Full on nasty. So I've been here 100 times or more and the last 2 out of three have made me want to vomit. So never ever going back and would recommend all my friends never go there. That wet soggy fish makes me shudder.

"1008-A Woodland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Today was my wife's birthday and she's always wanted to try this place out. We both grew up on the East Coast so it's difficult to be landlocked sometimes. Anyhow, we get there and get seated by the hostess/waitress. She hands us dirty, sticky, bended up menus. Ok, no biggie. She chooses the fried oysters and I get the coconut shrimp. She was very happy with her food, but I am writing this review on my selection. The description of the shrimp said that it was coated in coconut flakes and whatnot and served with a creamy coconut type dip of some kind. Great! Sounds delicious! While I'm waiting, I notice how disgusting the place is. The light hanging above us hasn't been dusted in eons. The window sill beside us has so much....dirt? bug droppings? I have no idea, but eww. I'm definitely feeling uneasy at this point. So we get the food. My shrimp looks like run of the mill breaded shrimp, no coconut on it. Not seasoned. Just plain old panko. The creamy sauce was so off-putting in it's appearance, I had a hard time allowing myself to try it. It looked like watered down condensed milk and tasted like it with coconut flavoring added. Not what I expected at all. I ate because I was hungry but didn't even eat half of it.This place has potential, I can see it. But the only way it'll succeed is if management and owner hires staff that truly cares about it's success. You guys have got to clean that restaurant. It. is. nasty.

I hadn't eaten oysters in a while so I took the chance on ordering oysters on a Tuesday in a landlocked state. Our waiter was friendly and when we ordered Diet Cokes it took him a while since he had to go to their storage area which was down the street and reconnect it. The oysters came and we got a dozen oysters which were shucked, came with cocktail sauce but no horseradish and just a few lemons. They tasted pretty good with a little salt and hot sauce, but not as tasty as I remembered. In its defense the last oysters I got were literally fresh from a block of ice.I also got the 2 piece fish and chips where the fries came in a paper bag at first. Again, not as good as I remembered from my last time but it could be nostalgia talking. I thought the fish was crispy but not overpowered by breading. The fries, were actually very surprising, also crispy and light. I hate Heinz malt vinegar-I think it's too sweet compared to the other malt vinegars. However, I did actually enjoy it with the pieces they had here.I thought it was enjoyable but the dishes I ordered weren't as tasty as the ones I've had before.

Like many others, we discovered this place because of the favorable Yelp reviews.We stopped in for a late dinner on a Monday night, 9:15pm. This allowed us a parking space in front, quick seating, and quick service... so we recommend going when it's not so busy.The clam chowder is excellent, with a nice savory flavor and dense consistency. I would've liked more clams, but the flavor made up for it.Fish and chips and cod sandwich were fried nicely, with just the right amount of seasoning. Homemade tartar and cocktail sauces tasted fresh and unique. Definitely worth a try.I had two sushi rolls, and chose them because of their unique ingredients. The Pad Thai roll was overwhelming with flavor, in a good way, though I didn't care for the abundance of crushed peanuts on top. It made chewing the sushi less enjoyable, so I ended up brushing them off. The Cobra roll with kiwi, avocado, and kimchee? Not bad, but not a must-have. It tasted fresh and gave a nice kick with the kimchee!Our waiter claimed this restaurant catered to families, like ours, but when we got the bill, he said that items on the kids menu did not include a drink, which was not stated on the menu.The kids menu did read, ""One free refill"", so we assumed drink included.

But with places like this I will probably make it more of a regular thing.  I wanted a good, fair priced dinner with some fun atmosphere. I found it here. Great Boston theme to the restaurant and even though I'm not a Red Sox fan, I appreciate the sweet baseball decor.  I'm not a big fan of fried seafood. But this was lightly breaded and fried. The fish (I had salmon) was of high quality and very tasty.  I also had Sushi which was of nice quality for the price. An overall great experience. Highly recommended.",Batter’d & Fried Boston Seafood House,6152269283,36 reviews,2014-07-03,"Nashville, TN",/biz/batterd-and-fried-boston-seafood-house-nashville,4.0,174,"Washington, DC",Mike A.
"1008-A Woodland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"My hubby & I ate here for lunch on a Monday. The place was pretty crowded when we walked in so I thought, ""the food must be really good""!  We were seated right away but we got put at a 2 person table. Normally this isn't a problem but the table was soooo small. There wasn't much room to put the food and it was making me feel uncomfortable so I asked if we could move to a bigger table once the crowd died down. Server was nice & accommodated us. The atmosphere of the place was full of Red Sox stuff on the walls. One side of the place was the bar area, which looked like the kind of place I wouldn't mind hanging out with a couple of friends. The place overall was clean, average size, very casual. Server came & took our drink order & food order in a timely fashion. The menu itself was a good amount of choices. And I love Sushi so that was a nice addition to have a good size sushi menu also. Although,  as someone mentioned in another review a ""gaijin"" is making the sushi. I didn't try any there but saw an order come by for another table. The sushi looked good & a generous size portion on the rolls. Wish I would have tried one. We ordered the Ceviche appetizer. It's made with crab meat, cilantro, tomatoes, onions & peppers, sliced avocado on top and tortilla chips on the side. I have had Ceviche all over, especially in the Carribbean. This tasted different, not like the ceviche I'm used to so maybe this is more of a East-Coast Boston? type Ceviche. Maybe this is how it's traditionally made there. But just so you know it is different, a different flavor profile. I didn't taste lime juice...if it had it, there wasn't nowhere near enough in it for a ceviche. The taste was good, ok, but not anything special and for the $9.99 price tag, I was a bit disgusted that it was just ok & that the portion was not very big. For that price I expected a huge plate full for us to share. I know crab is an expensive ingredient but still I think this was overpriced for what it was.  If we go back I would pass on that.   Oh and another thing I wanted to mention about the menu was that they had NO lunch specials! They had a couple of specials on the sushi rolls but no lunch portioned/cheaper specials on the dinners. Everything is pricey on their menu too, compared to other seafood restaurants who have similar items. And especially for such a casual restaurant. Our lunch was $50 for 2 people. We both had water, 1 appetizer, & 2 entrees. Most working people can't afford to spend that kind of money on lunch!  Or not very often anyway. This place could do more business I'm sure if they had lunch specials. Back to the food. My hubby ordered the seafood platter- $16.99.  It had  a piece of fish, clams, scallop, oysters, & shrimp, fries & slaw. The fried seafood has a nice crispy coating.  My husband said it was all ok. We've been to a lot of very good seafood restaurants so we don't go overboard if the food is just average. My dinner was the Atlantic Whole Belly Clams- $16.99. It was an 8 oz. portion of the whole belly clams, cole slaw & fries. I had never seen the whole belly clams on a menu anywhere near here. This is a specialty up North on the East coast too. I saw them talked about on a food tv show & they raved about how much better they were than just regular clams. They tasted like an oyster, more juicy like one. But I think my order was over cooked so the clams were a bit too chewy & not as tender as I expected them to be. Slaw was good, fries were good. The sauces that came with both platters were ok but they were both homemade. . ""The tarter  was homemade but looked like a creamy mayo with not much else in it. The cocktail sauce almost reminded me of a marinara sauce, a bit chunky and the taste was so so,. They had way too much pepper in that sauce. Oh & all the seafood, sauces, and even the chips with the ceviche was FULL of salt! Now, I like salt a lot & use it on just about everything so for me to say it's heavily salted than wow, it was on the verge on not being edible.So with all that said, this place is an average seafood restaurant but with big prices. Should you go out of your way to visit it, no. If you have the money to splurge on an expensive seafood dinner, this isn't the place either. So disappointed...it really COULD be a great place.

"1008-A Woodland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Let's cut to the chase. If you just want some good fried seafood, then this is your place. There aren't many places in the Nashville area that specialize in seafood, so I'm glad that this joint does it right. I drive from Franklin just to eat here.I only get one thing... the friend shrimp and scallop basket. Actually, they only have a fried shrimp or the fried scallop basket, but I have them do it half and half for me. And they always do it. I'm always amazed at how awesomely juicy and tender the scallops are time after time. When I order a scallop entree at a nice restaurant around time, they are never as good as they are at Batter'd and Fried. And they always give you a ton of fries in a brown paper bag, and I can never eat half of them.They also serve sushi, and it's good, because I did try it once with a girl friend of mine. I love sushi, but it's hard to pass on the friend stuff because I can find good sushi all over town. I've been to this place during the week, weekend, day, and night, and I've never been disappointed. On the weekends you'll sometimes have a good wait to be seated, but it's worth it!

"1008-A Woodland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Hoped to write a rave review, but the full belly clams, which I LOVED in New England, and that drew me here were led than anticipated. Good idea, but if not FRESH off the boat, they lose the creamy, melt in your mouth texture that makes them so addicting. I ordered a combo of fried oysters and fried whole belly clams. The oysters were delicious, but the clams, while whole belly, were tough, chewy, and grew in my mouth as I chewed them. Fries and cole slaw accompanied them. The fries were advertised as ""pub fries"" and were served in a brown paper bag - not sure why. Try we're not particularly hot nor were they as good as the ones served in New England or other places serving pub fries in other places. The slaw was average. I will NOT order the whole belly clams until I return to New England or know that they were air shipped from the boat THAT DAY!Nice ambience and the waitstaff was attentive.As I was leaving, Anne, the General Mgr came to talk to me about my experience with the whole belly clams and offered her apologies for my experience. While she admitted that bring frozen may have been the reason for my experience, she thought that they may not have been cooked properly and offered that she send me another batch. I was too full to accept the offer, but she extended the offer for my next visit.  GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE which endeared me to the restaurant.I'll come back for the oysters and other seafood - and because of Anne, i may try the whole belly clams again!",Batter’d & Fried Boston Seafood House,6152269283,86 reviews,2013-02-25,"Clarksville, TN",/biz/batterd-and-fried-boston-seafood-house-nashville,3.0,174,"Washington, DC",Gale K.

"1008-A Woodland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"This is one of those restaurants where the name says it all.  It's pretty much all seafood and almost all is battered and subsequently fried.  However, there is also sushi which is pretty much the opposite of battered and fried (unless you're getting some kind of tempura sushi).  I don't recommend it for the health conscious or vegetarians, unless you love sushi.I tried this place with my family the other night.  It's located in hip East Nashville which is much more bohemian than I would have expected out of Nashville.  The place is quite large with a dining area with a sushi bar, a full bar and an outdoor patio.The menu consists of all things seafood battered and fried.  There are shrimp, clams, oysters, scallops, several varieties of fish, etc.  If it comes from the ocean, they've probably fried it.  I did not see fried Sea Cucumber but there were fried sweet pickle chips.  These two are very different.  Your fried thing comes with a choice of sides which are mostly potatoes or slaw but there are some interesting options.  The sushi seemed to be pretty much white people sushi.  It was california rolls and salmon and all the standards that white people like.  It looked good and it was served well.  I am a little skeptical about sushi not prepared by a Japanese chef at a restaurant that specializes in sushi but my sister said it was good.They also serve many specialty drinks here.  There is a full bar and the drinks all sounded really good.  I tried a variation of a Long Island Iced Tea where it's topped with Sam Adams instead of coke.  It was interesting and somewhat refreshing, but not something I would want very often.I ordered the fried clams.  They were expertly prepared and very delicious.  It's hard to mess up fried clams and I'm glad they didn't.  I got a side of mashed potatoes which tasted good but were room temperature.  In addition, I ordered a side salad and I got it after my main meal because someone gave it to another table.  It was lettuce, tomato wedges and shredded yellow cheddar.  My sister got sushi and it looked good.  Our service was good.  We were seated in the bar area, directly next to the bar and our bartender was actually our server.  I think his attention was spread a little thin, but he was very nice and pretty attentive for being so busy.I don't know if I'm dying to go back, but I would if someone else wanted to.  Check it out if you love fried seafood or sushi.",Batter’d & Fried Boston Seafood House,6152269283,979 reviews,2010-04-03,"San Jose, CA",/biz/batterd-and-fried-boston-seafood-house-nashville,4.0,174,"Washington, DC",Ryan L.

"1008-A Woodland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Being from Massachusetts I was excited to go to Battered and Fried. The Red Sox memorabilia was awesome but I had to wonder why the Bruins weren't included in the theme. Or the Pats or the Celtics. Ordered the fish and chips because I love cod. The fish was really good but the tartar sauce was so not New England. The fried clams good too. I am very picky about tartar sauce. I couldn't really identify the offending ingredient but I think it had horseradish in it. It was weird and really ruined my dining experience. If I go back I am going to bring my own home made tartar sauce. The server was very nice and worked hard to make sure we had fun. It was not baseball season and I was shocked that he had no clue who Zdeno Chara is. Seriously???? Biggest guy in the history of the Bruins (6'9"" not counting skates) and Captain. So note, if you are fromMassachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire or Maine do yourself a favor, take your own tartar sauce and go during baseball season.

"1008-A Woodland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"After bookmarking this place months ago, I finally sat down for a meal here last night.  I wasn't disappointed.I've been on a quest to find the best New England Clam Chowder in town and I finally found a worthy contender.  They claim that it's so thick, that you can stand your spoon upright in it.  Well, I can confirm that is indeed the case.  While not filled with huge chunks of potatoes or clams, it delivers with the overall taste.  I'd definitely order it again, and it was filling and worth every bit of $5 for a bowl.My girlfriend had the Fried Grouper Salad, Buffalo style and said it was very good.  I had the New England Dinner, which consisted of a HUGE 12oz piece of haddock, and some fried whole belly clams.  I really wanted the fish and chips, but I saw the clams too and figured the NE dinner was the best of both worlds.  I wasn't in the mood for sushi, but my girl raved about the Pad Thai roll.  We also ordered the sweet pickle chips.  I'm normally not a fan, and despise dill pickles, but these were actually pretty good for what they were.I'll be back to try more things.  The patio seating was spacious and comfortable.",Batter’d & Fried Boston Seafood House,6152269283,108 reviews,2012-04-19,"Brentwood, TN",/biz/batterd-and-fried-boston-seafood-house-nashville,4.0,174,"Washington, DC",Travis A.

"1008-A Woodland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Why did I do it? This one was totally my bad.I guess I was feeling a little homesick and the idea of some good fried fish and good sushi was too tempting to pass up. I should have thought twice when I saw a gaijin behind the sushi bar. I should have ordered fish and chips, something nearly impossible to mess up. But no, I ordered chirashi. The fish, although definitely safe to eat, was probably the worst-cut mess I have ever seen. Just bad. It was all differently-sized chunks and totally not the right consistency. But that was nothing compared to M's buffalo grouper sandwich. Again, insane thing to order. But strips of grouper, deep fried and soaked in buffalo sauce, sounded like the perfect meal at the time. The combination of flavors was... gym socks. I'll leave it there.That being said, the waiter was very nice and attentive. And they were open at 9:30 on a weeknight when we rolled into town.

It's as close to Boston as you can get, in Nashville. The clam chowder that I had in Boston was one of the best things that I've ever tasted.

I am not particularly a fan of fried food, but was pleasantly surprised at the selection of sushi and non-fried foods, including burgers, pasta and salads.

"1008-A Woodland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Overall: I give the classic fish 'n chips option a thumbs up but the sushi is nothing impressive. Low key/comfortable place but be prepared for it to get a little pricey.Food: My favorite on the menu is probably a salad that has seared tuna & goat cheese (random given the name of the restaurant) but the classic fish 'n chips are good as well (though i do sub out the chips for onion rings - big fan of the onion rings!) The pieces of fish are about the size of 1 1/2 or 2 decks of cards so keep that in mind when you're deciding 1 versus 2. I've heard good things about the sushi, but honestlly, i was not impressed. I had a few of the rolls and the flavors just didn't impress me. The wine/beer/drink list isn't bad but the wine does seem a little expensive for the bottles that they have on hand.

The portion size was great. The slaw and fries were delicious. The chicken fingers were from frozen and not that good. They were like dense little morsels of dried meat.  The Haddock was 10 ounces and was just like any other standard fried fish. One chicken finget and piece of fish in I was done, the fried quotient reached, the oil seeping through my pours. I don't plan to come back for the fried seafood.

From the outside it looks a little sketchy, but inside the food and atmosphere are great.Definitely not the sort of place you'd order sushi, but we had good recommendations from some friends and past patrons, and they were right on the money. The fish was fresh and tasty and the special rolls were ""fancy"" enough to be interesting, while letting you enjoy the quality of the fish inside.

I can't recall a worse experience at a restaurant.Our visit started off with our friends taking us to this place while we were in town visiting.  There was a little bit of a wait and the hostess couldn't really give us an accurate wait time.  When we asked her opinion, she stated to us that she would not wait.  Wow-way to bring in the business.  When we decided to put our name down she became annoyed, as though her job just got a lot harder in order for her to print our name on the paper.   There were six of us and two of us were pregnant.  The guys opted to stand near the door and us three girls found a table to sit at near the bar.  We asked if it was okay since there was a wait and the hostess said it was since nobody else was waiting to sit in that area.   The bar was crowded and a line of people stood even behind the bar stools watching the game. A waiter who was having to slide through the crowd came by and looked at the girl that was standing on the end of our table and said ""Can you move somewhere else?""   There was no please...no smile, no offer to take our non alcoholic drink order..no nothing. Just the request, and he walked off.    He didn't bother to ask any of the 20 men standing in the way to move over.  Okay, so they have some rude wait staff...Surely the food is worth the wait and the pathetic lack of customer service.Our guys finally went to the bar and got us a few drinks (non alcoholic of course), dropped off the drinks at our table and then went back to stand out of the way.  The rude server then comes back and asks us if we would like to order something...OBVIOUSLY seeing our drinks and the fact that we had already been sitting there 20 minutes.  When we told him we got drinks from the bar, he threw his hands up and said ""PERFECT."" And again..walked away without saying anything else.  About 15 minutes went by and we still didn't have a table, hadn't been spoken to by anyone else and continued to receive the evil eye from the rude waiter each time he walked by and had to turn sideways to get by.  We then decided to leave when an Asian looking manager came up to the table beside us to clean it off. I told him I""d like to discuss the lack of customer service we had received at the restaurant and he seemed annoyed right off and continued to wipe the table without so much as some eye contact.  After I told him that the hostess informed us that she would not in fact wait to eat here..he looked at me in disbelief as though I was lying and put his hands up and said ""Really, no why would she do that?""  I started to go into detail about the rude waiter but he continued to have this look on his face like he didn't care so we just got our belongings and left.   Again...no customer service when he was about to lose 6 customers...no asking us to wait a moment to see if he could rectify the problem, no apologies..  Wow.  I was in disbelief..how do you run a business like that?Needless to say none of us or our friends have been back.",Batter’d & Fried Boston Seafood House,6152269283,15 reviews,2011-12-22,"Huntsville, AL",/biz/batterd-and-fried-boston-seafood-house-nashville,1.0,174,"Washington, DC",Ashli J.

COME HERE. no joke. it was insanely awesome. i stumbled upon battered and fried thru random bar crawls around 5-points. the name wasn't too appealing. [don't let it fool you.] i yelped ""restaurants in nashville"" and a few popped up. this one had good reviews for the most part, and when it said ""clam chowder"", i was damn-near sold. it was pretty quiet in there, which was unfortunate. we went in on a friday afternoon...around 3ish. i ordered myself a bloody mary from a really friendly server. overlooking the menu, i was thuroughly impressed. THEY ALSO SERVE SUSHI. they have an extensive list of handmade maki rolls. being korean and japanese and craving seafood, i was game to try how fresh their fish was and how they could pull sushi off in the south. unfortunately between the hours of 2 and 5 they do not serve sushi. we had the seared ahi tuna appetizer instead. it wasn't the best. they encusted the crap out of it, to where each bite tastes like a sesame cracker. i just like the raw fish. if you cut the outer crust off, it's pretty good. they use an unagi sauce on it. like a teriyaki glaze. it would've been better had it had some garlic and ginger. give it some freshness to the marinade. i wasn't sweating it too much because i got oysters on the halfshell that i was working on, and let me tell you, these were the BEST oysters i've had. the liquor was so sweet, they were freshly caught and shucked that very same day and they were effing MASSIVE. amazing.i ordered the surf and turf with mashed potatoes and a cup of clam chowder.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I attended a concert at City Winery on July 9,2015. The layout, decor, and overall space is promising for a concert. They of course have an incredible wine selection, upscale bar food, and descent amenities to offer you during your visit. Although the positives for City Winery are plenteous, I would say there are a few areas they kept me from giving them 5 stars.The first opportunity I found was with the valet. Although I read previous post about the price, which is $5, my concern was simply with the staff. These people are your first experience with the venue and they were very unfriendly and uninviting to my wife and I. Yes, you took my car and brought it back to me at the nights end but try and be as upbeat and excited as the workers inside the facility. Secondly, would have to deal with the food. I will openly admit that these opportunities fall solely on personal preference and not solid data but I believe there were some concerns. First, if you are offering a special, only allowed for the restaurant and not the stage area, don't put it on the projectors and show it to me every four minutes. Secondly, 98% of the food offered was not sharable but was also too large. I understand I'm at a restaurant but at the same time I am not. I have experienced in other locations shareable, medium size dishes worked better. Lastly, I didn't enjoy my food. My wife and I purchased the truffle fries and risotto balls for an appetizer then a hamburger, which was a burnt on the outside and raw in the middle, and a chicken dish which my wife enjoyed. The dining is attempting to be upscale and new age but seemed to miss the mark with each selections. The fries come with a garlic mayo which does nothing except take away from the fry. The risotto ball, which should come with marinara sauce, is accompanied with BBQ sauce and spicy mustard. Both offering nothing to highlight the flavors of their counterparts.  You can see the definite potential with City Winery but these are just a few areas where attention could be shown. Lastly, on a side note. If you are going to a concert and truly care about your view and sound quality, I would definitely recommend forgetting the front sections of sits. Although this is usually my section of choice, the venue and atmosphere of food, wine, and conversation with your neighbors really demands you sit in the second section and back.

As others have said parking is pretty impossible unless you do valet - which is $5. Don't try to park in the adjacent lot unless you want to be stopped by security in a golf cart.Since I had a ViP ticket, I was escorted to my seat. I don't know if the tables are always that close together, but I am on the lower end of a ""normal"" weight range and I felt like it was a tight squeeze. Not just on each side but even scooting my chair out. The person at the table behind me could not have pulled his chair out simultaneously with me. We were that close.The bathrooms were okay. They ran out of paper towels and they stayed out through the evening.The wine list is not as impressive as the name would lead you to believe. No Moscato anywhere on the list if you can believe that... Not even available by the bottle. I am such a Moscato fanatic (my dog is named after it if that gives you any indication), I would have bought a whole bottle despite being a two drink max girl. But alas it was not meant to be.I wound up getting a burger with those truffle fingerlings with some Chardonnay (sweet, but moscato you were not). The food was... Ok.I hadn't eaten all day. All I had had was caffeine. Caffeine and adrenaline. And somehow I didn't even manage to eat half the burger. I don't know...And I love truffle oil. Truly do. On fries. Tater tots. Grilled cheese. You name it. But, I found these needed salt and some (gasp!) ketchup to go with as they lacked seasoning. Service during the show was good. And quiet. She literally managed to get me my bill without me noticing she had placed it down.I also love the water at the table - reminds me of Bailey's Chocolate Bar in St Louis. It also saves the waiters time.But after the concert, the service was not so nice. A hostess came up to me to ask me where I got where I was wearing. She said another hostess absolutely loved it. I told her it wasn't a dress but a top and skirt but that only the petticoat was still available. She huffed off. Told the other hostess and not so nice commentary ensued after as if they didn't believe me when I said it was no longer available - it sold out circa 2013...

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I had bought concert tickets here and decided to eat dinner here last minute, as well. First impression walking in: gorgeous ambiance. The lounge area is very open with lots of wood finishings and a round staircase surrounded by wine bottles. Very pretty. Our dinner included: fried risotto balls, chicken fricasse, pork belly, lemon olive oil cake, and a few glasses of wine. Overall, I was pretty pleased with the meal, especially the pork belly which was crisp and succulent. The risotto balls were also good and reminded me of falafel. The sweet jam that comes with the lemon olive oil cake was the best part of the dish, but next time I'll probably order the chocolate stout cake which I couldn't stop drooling over from looking at it from the table next to me. Dinner here is definitely not cheap. Our meal (for 2) came out to be $140 without tip. Plus, they charge an exorbitant amount of tax since they charge you liquor tax as well. Why the establishment (a ""winery"") doesn't pay it itself is kind of strange.  Also, valet parking is $5. Good luck finding parking elsewhere. The concert itself was pretty good, although considering that this establishment hosts many musicians and artists, the acoustics weren't the best. Maybe it was an off night.

Shame on you for passing that onto your customers!I got the huevos rancheros. They were okay. Not impressive. Please note that they put hot sauce on several of their brunch items although it is not listed on the menu. Several of the girls had to send their items back because they can't eat spicy food. Once everyone was done with their meals, it took an hour for us to receive our checks. Yes, an HOUR. I'm not exaggerating. I timed it.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"My wife and I hit City Winery last Friday to see Matthew Sweet play.  This is already one of my favorite music venues in Nashville.First off, it's just awesome to be able to sit and have a drink while watching a concert.  I think I'm getting too old to stand throughout a show.  The service was very good and I was impressed with the wine and beer list.  We were told that they would actually have wine for sale that they personally made (as any winery should) within a few months.  We weren't sure about the menu because the show started at 10:00, but they were still serving.  We had already eaten, but did order dessert.  It was a peach dish and was very good--reminded me of creme brulee a bit.  The menu appeared to have an excellent selection and you're probably looking at about $20 per dish.  However, there are appetizers and desserts if you don't want to a whole meal (or, you could just drink).This place is great.  Check out their calendar as they do have a diverse list of acts.  I look forward to trying their food on the next visit and could easily see myself adding a fifth star.",City Winery Nashville,6153241010,171 reviews,2015-06-15,"Franklin, TN",/biz/city-winery-nashville-nashville-2,4.0,107,"Washington, DC",Adam V.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"My girlfriend and I tried City Winery for a Griffin House show in mid-November one Wednesday night. Mostly we wanted to see the new concert behemoth of SoBro (I still hate the name SoBro). First off, the atmosphere. This place is beyond superlatives beautiful and tasteful, all at the same time. They've made it obvious it's a nicer place without overwhelming the concert-goer seeking to just enjoy a show with a nice glass of wine. They'll start making their own wine here in 2015 so we'll be interested to go back and see even more of this gorgeous venue.The wine. I'm just starting to understand different types of wines and an amateur at best in describing what I want in a wine. The waiter was well-trained and did not lead us astray when we were making our selection from the multiple wines on tap, available for a glass, and those available by a bottle. We tried a couple of these before we left and weren't disappointed. The food. It was good, not great. I had the leg of lamb pizza, which was tasty with a good mix of spices, crunchy pine nuts, and melty cheese. She got the Chicken Fricassee which was good but reminded me of much less expensive items I've had elsewhere. The food was tasty and good to munch on during a show or for dinner. I'm probably going to have dinner elsewhere the next time we visit City Winery, however.Pros: Amazing building and predictably great wine selection.Cons: Food was kind of expensive and didn't blow me away. The parking was pretty terrible. They offered paid valet or you can park on the streets, which is not the best option in this neighborhood.Overall: This a relaxing, romantic place to take a date for a concert. You will win friends  and influence people if you bring someone from out of town in for a concert.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I was sold when I discovered they offer wine on tap! Yes please! I actually came in on Saturday night for dinner and then returned again yesterday. I was impressed with this place, and have only gone to the restaurant area. It is cozy and welcoming with wine barrels directly built into the wall above the bar. They also have a private room that can hold 10-15 people. When you sit down, you are greeted with a taste of white wine that is delicious and the perfect start to the meal. The wine list is crazy long and separate, but I stuck with the smaller portion of the wines on tap that can be found in the food menu. The syrah is delicious and you can get it in 3 different portion sizes. For food, I sampled the risotto balls and the Mezze plate with multiple dips. I liked them both, but probably wouldn't order them again. Luckily there are tons of other appetizers that look delicious and will try next time! For entrees, I sampled the fish specials, and they offered barracuda which was unique and delicious! Last night I had the lamb loin and my SO had the flat iron steak, both were great, but I enjoyed the lamb best. They also offer cheese and meat plates and flat breads as well. Everything was very delicious and reasonably priced too. My lamb was only $26.00! City Winery is fantastic and I haven't even seen a show yet! There are a few things that could use some improvement; the $7.00 valet is pricey, and I think some of the appetizers need some slight tweaking, but overall I very much enjoyed it and know I will be back and soon!",City Winery Nashville,6153241010,484 reviews,2014-10-22,"Nashville, TN",/biz/city-winery-nashville-nashville-2,4.0,107,"Washington, DC",Sheena T.
"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Have you ever fallen in love? Felt your heart race, and excitement course through you, and all you can think about is your next encounter with the object of your affections?That is how I will describe the truffle fries at City Winery.I will be honest, that I can only speak to the truffle fries and wine, but, on the basis of truffle fries alone, I am granting this place four stars. They are perfectly cooked wedges of potato, seasoned with truffle, parmesan, and prosciutto; they are a culinary romance of the tongue, so much so that, after splitting an order with a friend, we decided to promptly order a second order. Following that, we started plotting how we could get the waiters to bring us additional free orders.And therein lies the problem. City Winery is somewhat like a beautiful gold-digger, tempting you and asking for everything you have, all at the same time. It is so pricey that you (at least if you make a teacher's salary) are left wanting more. More free parking spaces (valet is $5), more alcohol (the cheapest wine glass was, I believe, $8), and more food (one order of fries was $8).

Seemed all the servers that night were on it, when looking around. I actually came in with my wheelchair and they accommodated me. Staff was nice.I was greeted and offered a beverage.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"There's too much against this place for me to give it a higher review. I want to like it more! My first time was confusing-I didn't know where I was supposed to go, and no one greeted me when I came inside. I had to go up to a hostess and ask, and she was not the friendliest. Seemed like I was inconveniencing her for not knowing how things worked. It wasn't crowded, otherwise I would have watched other people.Things I like: environment is very nice.

Encountered a rude hostess (Won't get into that story). Tacos were good but had to be eaten w/ fork & knife, which kind of defeats the purpose of tacos...

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I have only ever been here for shows.  And even though it hasn't been open long I've been to several.  I know there's a restaurant and bar space out front (the live music venue is in the back) but I haven't eaten there or even sat there so this review is focused solely on the gigantic slice of heaven that is the stage in the back.Despite the large space the venue manages to be intimate, and the artists they book are not only talented but may not be your usual fare.  Many of them are older, classic performers, with amazing stories, or newcomers with some serious lyrical soul.  The acoustics are fantastic as well, and there's something about being able to just sit and enjoy some great food, drink, and entertainment without needed to dance or run around.  Its relaxing and enjoyable.The staff is incredible in their ability to move around quickly without blocking your view of the stage or having to shout at you to ask if you want another drink.  And the drinks and food are just wonderful.  I am a huge fan of their beet and bacon flatbread and their burger.  They have so many delicious wines to choose from, as well as other alcoholic offerings, but if you love wine I recommend a bottle or two for a good show.Most of the shows start by 8pm and are done by 11pm.  The servers are great at getting your tabs to you before the end of the show so you're not scrambling.  Its really just an overall fantastic dining and musical experience.They offer free valet most nights, and even at soldout shows are great about getting your cars quickly.  The whole experience is just so laid back and enjoyable, and I've never had a bad time.  I highly recommend taking in a show here and coming early to eat.  The tickets for the concerts are usually more than reasonable, as is the food.  It's a great way to spend a Nashville night.",City Winery Nashville,6153241010,299 reviews,2015-01-05,"Nashville, TN",/biz/city-winery-nashville-nashville-2,5.0,107,"Washington, DC",Bridgette C.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Reviewing this mostly as a music venue: This is one of those reviews that it's kind of painful to look at that two stars, but I'll try to justify it since there's no 2.4 star option.Valet parking - despise it, despise it more when it takes forever in the freezing cold because of a valet issue, which it did after the show.Friends bought us tickets to see a show there. We had front-table seats,  this should have been great. Unfortunately the assigned seating up there meant I spent the time faced almost completely away from the performers. I was jammed next to a couple I didn't know, had very little space behind me, so turning my chair was not particularly a feasible option. Very little room behind or to the sides.I took a break from looking at the stage after a while because my neck hurt so much from craning it. I noticed there were plenty of free and open seats and tables, and the aisles they had constructed were huge so they could have given people a lot more space at the tables simply by not allowing 4 people to walk side by side in the aisles.If we'd just had enough space to turn the chairs 90 degrees in the viewing situation would have been pleasant. We were packed in the sardine fashion, which was absurd because there were plenty of free tables.Got up a couple of times to hit the restroom, just stayed standing off at the side of the stage until I felt like getting into the table pit again.The food was alternately great and just ok, but the prices for everything were on the pricey side. I'll remind I was there for the performance, not for the food. My neck, back, and ears were annoyed by nearly everything at about five songs in.Basically a slightly layout change to the tables would solve most of it, open seating after a certain point would have been nice, ability to get the car parked and unparked sans valet would be great.By the time I left I was in a mood. For a music venue they could be so great, but it's just not set up for that and the way they have the up front seating. It was a very expensive, neck pain inducing night.Maybe I should just say I'm old, this music venue made me grumpy. Get off my lawn. Food was tasty though.

I would highly recommend doing so as it was delicious, and the servings were surprisingly large. (Make sure to ask if you've got food allergies as they may substitute some dishes for you.)However the wine pairings you can leave out. I would suggest if you're familiar with your wines that you just choose yourself. Some of the pairings were a bit overwhelming.Overall:I enjoyed the food very much.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I really wanted to love this place.Unfortunately, it missed the great mark for me.Let me start with the pros...Beautiful ambiance, happy hour specials, great event venue, solid menuThe restaurant itself is gorgeous. There is an upstairs event space, a spacious bar area and a great stage set up. A group of 6 of us ordered dinner while watching the Marc Cohn show last week. Dinner: Everyone enjoyed the food. The service was less than impressive though. The server seemed to be overwhelmed by the tables he had. It took forever for him to take orders for cocktails. Then an even longer forever to come back with cocktails. Then add on some more forever to take out orders.Nothing ruins a beautiful dining experience like subpar service. You can correct an underwhelming dish, but underwhelming service can ruin an experience for me. Having been a server/bartender for a number of years I am both very critical (internally) but also forgiving (externally) when it comes to service. I am never rude, even if the service is subpar. That being said, it is an absolute pet peeve of mine when a server cannot keep up with who ordered what at a table of 6. In an establishment as nice as City Winery that just should not be the case. It is a complete moodkiller for the server to have people at the table check off what they had on a printed out receipt. It is even more annoying when the server encourages the table to split the check evenly because ""it's easier that way"". Unless there is a policy against separate checks that is indicated to a party at the outset, it is the server's responsibility to separate checks. It is a pain in the a** to do so, but that is what is expected. Ultimately we ended up splitting it evenly because after the 2nd return everyone was irritated. I will note that the show was over completely before we even got to the even split of the checks, though everyone was done eating before that.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I'll echo what some other reviews have stated as far as seeing shows at City Winery.  The tables are absolutely small and the chairs are way too close together. If you want to actually see the stage you'll have to sit uncomfortably sideways while packed in there like sardines. Sitting at tables that small, and in chairs crammed that close together while seated at tables with strangers isn't my thing. At all. I'll reserve attendance here in the future for those very few things that I absolutely can't live without seeing. The valet thing. The not-free valet. Annoying. We were warned beforehand and parked on the street in the neighborhood. Not the safest feeling neighborhood at night but it sure beats waiting in the huge line we saw after the show. If you valet you're gonna have to wait a while to get out of there. The food isn't cheap. The drinks really aren't cheap. I think the beer list consists of 8 choices? That's total. That's not just the draft list. Or the bottles list. So when I ordered one of the beers off the list (a stout) and something other than what I ordered showed up I questioned it (after several minutes of trying to flag a waiter down). Supposedly they had run out of the stout I ordered and sent this other stout as a replacement. With no explanation. Or apology. It was weird. If you're going to have a beer list that small at least make sure you have the few that are on the damn menu. And ask if it's ok with the customer before sending out a substitute.

All were very good, brought out promptly and reasonably priced. Didn't mind the $5 valet as that seems cheap to me and love not fooling with parking, worth the money everyday. It was slightly odd sharing a table with people since we had 2 tickets but it was a table for 4. However, we chatted and had a lovely time.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"First, I want to start by saying that before I write a review I give establishments ample visits to earn the rating. I've now been to City Winery 3 times and remain less than impressed.SERVICE: The service at City Winery is either on overdrive and in your face or non existent and there doesn't seem to be a happy medium. During my last visit to City Winery on Friday (upstairs in the ""lounge"") our waiter asked for our drink orders and food orders at the same time. Our food came out first, after about 20 min (without even water on the table) and then about 10 min later, we got our drinks. Also, on a previous visit I was denied a taste of one of CW's on-tap wines because the bar was ""too busy"". PRICE: Pricing for shows is competitive. PARKING: Valet - I've been charged $5 sometimes then they didn't collect payment another time..not sure what the deal is, but they never seem to have enough attendants working for when a show that seats a few hundred lets out at one time.FOOD: The food is tasty, nothing extraordinary, especially with the great food scene in this city. A little pricy.SEATING: Unless you buy seats at an entire table you'll be sitting with strangers, which can be fun, but not when you're literally rubbing elbows with them. The tables are tiny and wayyyy to small to seat strangers together. Also, it's a bummer that you have to buy a seat - City Winery is more about selling the ""experience"" than a ticket to a great show. Also, you're SOL if you have more people in your group than a table can accommodate, so I would be very hesitant to say this place is group friendly. Overall, Nashville has such wonderful, unique and historic venues (lookin at you Ryman, Marathon Music Works, War Memorial Auditorium) that I'm not really sure how or why City Winery has a place here. I would much rather go to a show at any of these other venues or a laundry list of others not mentioned before coming to CW. In short, go back to New York. However, I'll likely return because they book great shows.",City Winery Nashville,6153241010,25 reviews,2015-03-23,"Nashville, TN",/biz/city-winery-nashville-nashville-2,2.0,107,"Washington, DC",Savannah R.
"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"We really wanted to like this place since they are getting some music on the books that we like, and want to see, but I will be hard pressed to return. We have been to City Winery twice now. The first time we went, we did as the website had suggested which was to come between 6-7 for dinner before the show. WAY too early, as it was awkward to be in the music venue with all these empty tables around you. It just felt weird. The food wasn't that great either. The only thing we ordered that we liked was the truffle fingerling potatoes. The flatbread was soggy, and the cheese plate was underwhelming and expensive for the stingy portions.  We were disappointed that a winery boasting such a large list doesn't sell any bottle of wine for under $40. The second time we went, we ate dinner beforehand and decided to just have some wine during the show. We ordered a 2010 Malbec that she opened right when she got to the table (in the dark - you can't see!) and poured for us to taste, BUT we were never shown the bottle until she had poured it out and walked away. It was 2011. Not a big deal for inexpensive wine, but if I had been buying a $200 bottle that was wrong, I would have been incensed.When we got the bill, (it had slipped past us on our previous visit) we noticed that they charged the Liquor By The Drink tax that EVERY other restaurant in the ENTIRE STATE builds into their pricing, but City Winery charges it ON TOP of your already overpriced drink. So a $40 is really $46, a $15 whiskey is $17.25 plus sales tax etc...it is in small print on the menu, but you feel gouged already, and then that tax just seems like a big F-You. Paying for rude valets who don't even unlock the door for you, much less open it, plus overpriced food that isn't good, and really overpriced drinks just made us feel nickeled and dimed. Unlike others, we did have good service inside the venue. Again, I wanted to like this place - the upstairs patio has beautiful views of downtown and it's a nice space, but we just feel like it's not worth what you end up spending for an evening there.",City Winery Nashville,6153241010,41 reviews,2015-07-16,"Nashville, TN",/biz/city-winery-nashville-nashville-2,2.0,107,"Washington, DC",Mod F.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I have not seen a show here so can only speak on the dining experience. I took my mother there for her birthday to try some of the wines and share appetizers. You wouldn't think this would be such a let down. The food was a TERRIBLE let down. we first ordered a flatbread which was supposed to have parmesan, mushroom confit, red onion, apple butter, and red pepper olive oil. When it came out it also had some kind of greens on it....guessing collard. If you are going to put ingredients on a flatbed, you need to have it on the menu. Even though it took a long time to come out, it was still overly doughy with a strange bitterness taste. We sent that back immediately. While looking over the menu to find anything else to eat while we drank our overly priced wine, we thought maybe we would share a bottle of wine. The sommelier came over to us to go over some of them. You would think he would go into detail about a few wines, but instead asked a question or two of what we liked, pointed to a page for us to look over, and then pointed to the most expensive bottle of wine on the page. Still wanting to give it a chance, hoping that the flatbread was a fluke, we ordered the risotto balls (a recommendation by our server). They were BLAND. If you live in the south or are going to have a restaurant in the south, learn how to season your food! We heard the chef came from Holland House so I was really excited to see what it was about. Total Let down. I will NEVER go back. Another thing to mention is the LBTD tax (%15 added on to the wine on the tap) that they slip in there. There is small print on the menu letting you know this, but it is very small.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I think this venue is going to have a successful run. It's quite lovely. There is a bar out front so you can go even if you're not watching a show. There's also additional space upstairs but we didn't check that out.We didn't dine with the winery; we started with dinner at the Omni and walked over. I will say that I was surprised to see the valet charging seven dollars. I do not believe that there is parking available anywhere else, so if you drive, you will likely be paying to valet.We had wine and cocktails in the concert hall as well as at the bar afterwards. Both were very good. Pricey, but I've come to expect that in the new Nashville.The concert was Joan Osborne and she sounded fantastic as always. The acoustics were fine to my ears. Be careful when choosing your seats because some in your party will likely need to crane there necks a little to view the stage. The seats are regular chairs, not stools that swivel. Still, the space is nice, and well presented. I'm very impressed with the lineup they've been able to book thus far.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"This review is just for the restaurant part of City Winery. I didn't go see a show there, since I'm under 40, and their lineup makes me depressed just looking at it. Unfortunately their food made me even more depressed. The menu (like the music lineup) is straight out of the '90s: pretend fancy and bland, dating back to a time when people were probably just easier to impress. I'm vegan and only went to eat there because they had a promising-sounding vegan entree listed on their online menu, but our waitress explained that they took it off since nobody was ordering it. So I ended up paying $17 for a slimy portobello mushroom with a bit of couscous on the side.I'm not against paying $17 for an entree when it's good. But there are much better restaurants in Nashville to spend your money at, and after picking up my car from valet (which you have to pay $7 for, by the way) I wished I had gone to one of them.P.S.: Don't waste your time writing to management.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Dropped into the City Winery for brunch and could have stayed the entire day. One if the coolest new places I have visited in some time. Firstly, the decor and ambiance is super! Even if your not a wine lover, this place has a rich, warm, homey feel that adds to the experience. There is an upstairs and a downstairs area for drinks and food. Both have outdoor patios that give you some great views of Nashville on sunny summer days. In addition, they have a concert venue that provides not only great entertainment, but seating that allows for food and wine during your show. Very cool!!The staff was well versed in the wine and food selections. They were helpful but not pushy with any particular selections. We shared the Huevos Rancheros and Vegetable Frittata, both of which were delicious. The Frittatta was perfectly cooked and was very rich in flavor while not skimping on the vegetables. Likewise, the Huevos Rancheros was fantastic. Perfect blend of spices, black beans and egg. All this topped with a great Pinot.....

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I went to City Winery last night for a yoga event.First of all, the main reason I am writing a review is that I agree with many of the other reviews on this and just want to reinforce in case it helps the venue create alternate options:The parking situation is not great and I will plan ahead if I decide to return. It's in an area that has the space for parking, in fact, there is parking all around. I can only assume they have already categorized themselves as a leading music venue, like when you arrive at the Ryman and there is a valet option. The trouble is I (and the community seems to agree) that it doesn't warrant itself for this yet. I pulled in seeing the valet (and probably at fault of my own for not asking) assumed it was how all the other valet in town is - complementary because you are visiting that restaurant/bar. I didn't know that it was $5 until I arrived after the event to get my car. I was surprised and though it's not super steep, it was definitely a bummer. The venue isn't even in what is considered ""downtown""  and there is not enough other stuff around it to feel like a place where paid parking is the only option. I had a couple of small tastings at the event (which I assume) were from City Winery's kitchen - they were yummy, but my friends opted to go someplace else for dinner - one citing she had eaten there before and it was just okay, not great. The decor was a little corporate-cheesy - reminded me of the Cheescake Factory or something you would see in an upscale chain restaurant. While I know there are other City Winery locations in the US, it would have been cool to tailor the decor to more of a Nashville feel. The sound for the DJ/yogi's mics was not quite right - hope that's not indicative of what the sound for shows. I imagine there is a sound tech and soundcheck that would eliminate the poor sound. It was just fine for the purpose for which I was there for, but would be disappointing if it were a concert.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"As a music venue, very nice. Great sound, physically spacious yet intimate-feeling. Except for my first experience, for Sturgill Simpson in August which was a crowd of Americana fans and a private event, I have never yet seen the place full, however. it's early, though, and I'm sure it's still getting its footing. It's about a 300-seat venue, which really helps you feel connected with the artist, but a lot of that has to do with the act, as well. It's not really great that you have to share a table for eight with people you don't know for dinner and a show; it'd be nice if there were more tables for two and four, as there are hardly any in the whole house.The menu, however, is less impressive. Pretentious is okay if you can back it up with taste, but it's just not there. So, it's a pretentious and pricey fail. Since City Winery is a wine venue, it thinks it has to offer only complicated dishes, and I enjoy the occasional highbrow reduction or unusual flavor combination. The friend who was with me, however, does not, and that's okay, too. Sometimes wine is best when it accompanies something simple, and there is not even one menu item that might be qualified as uncomplicated or unfussy. Not one. Take a look at your menu, Chef, and relax it a bit. Give us a variety of options, to appeal to a variety of diners, in the way the sommelier offers the wine list. Everybody will win.I will say that our server, whose name was Matt, I believe, was very patient and was happy to take time to explain every description and answer every question we had. I ended up with the beet salad, and when that proved too spicy because of the cayenne pepper, I ordered the cheese plate and made that work, although I did not enjoy the horseradish spread that was one of the accompaniments. Also, when we arrived, the seating staff said that we were to sit at separate tables, and of course, I wasn't going to have any of that. Our arrangements had us seated together, and I was polite, but had to insist that they check their seating chart notes again. After just a few minutes, we were led to one of the few tables for two, off to the side but still well in view of the music. I was happy that they made the effort to correct the error without any attitude at all. I did attend a private event at one of the smaller upstairs rooms that also had a little stage and a bar. I was helping at that event, so did not experience it as a patron, but I did notice that the bartenders were friendly and helpful, and the waiters seemed prompt at the tables. The hors d'oeuvres trays, however, lacked variety and imagination. Anyone can put crackers and cheddar on a plate with strawberries, but to be fair, maybe that is what the client ordered from the catering staff.The parking is what everybody else says it is, but I have had great luck with the valet staff being exceptional every time. I've never waited more than a few minutes for my car. They really ought to offer the valet as complimentary, however, since there aren't any other real parking options. So, it's like this:Main Music venue: BDining Menu: DService: B (Matt was a little slow, and rushed us on the check)Private events: BParking: B-Overall: B-",City Winery Nashville,6153241010,1 review,2014-12-27,"Hermitage, TN",/biz/city-winery-nashville-nashville-2,3.0,107,"Washington, DC",Shannon T.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I don't normally post reviews (actually, I have never posted one) but, maybe I should have. My wife and I have eaten at many of the newer restaurants around town and have enjoyed the majority of them. We went to City Winery last night to watch a show and eat dinner. Here are my thoughts:First, the good: Cool place, nice outdoor seating for just drinks or a meal. The inside is really nice and the concert area is cool and spacious.Now for the bad: No parking and forced to pay $7 for valet service--that is in addition to the tip. The food is edible but not special. Smoked avocado dip is just run of the mill and very thin chips that broke when we tried to dip with them. The entrées--my wife had bacon and beet flatbread and I had the chicken--were overpriced for the quality of the food. Chicken was very average and the side of grits was nothing special. The flatbread was just flatbread--nothing special. For the name--City Winery--the wine selection was poor and the beer list was also limited (Nashville has awesome local brews, but there were only two on the menu).The acoustics were not good either. We were seated in the upper deck and couldn't even understand the musicians when they talked and sang (maybe the sound quality is better on the main floor); I was expecting much better in such a new and intimate setting.Overall, this would be a decent place to go to hear a band or singer if you could be fairly close to the stage, but I would recommend eating elsewhere since there are many options nearby.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"City Winery should stick with its namesake-wine. Their attempt at brunch was lackluster, uninspired, and left our party disappointed. City winery has obviously put a great deal of thought into its role as a wine bar, but brunch was clearly an afterthought that has yet to grow to maturity.  Nashville has such a great culinary community that we were sad we wasted Sunday brunch here.Service- disorganized and confused. Two servers (one may have been the manager) approached us to take our drink order, and neither was very timely about it. Both food and drinks took a long time to order and come out.  The glass bottles of water on the table warmed quickly in the sun, and the server refilled the water only at our specific request.  Patio service seemed to be an afterthought.Drinks- the spicy Bloody Mary is vibrant, but the glass was tiny and filled with ice, which made the $9 price tag a shock.Food- when we first sat, we asked the waiter/manager what jumped out on the menu.  His response seemed to be that brunch was a way to let people try the food without the price tag of dinner.   His response made sense when the food came out much later.  Steak and eggs were well prepared, but with small portions and so poorly plated it was more akin to white plate Waffle House. Flavor was lacking, prompting the table to wonder whether salt/pepper shakers should have been on the table. Shrimp and grits were filling, but tails were detached and mixed in with the grits, which required some digging. All in all, at $18 and $15, respectively, the price was far higher than the value.Ambience- great patio, and the venue is beautiful, but didn't meet its potential to entertain. For Nashville, we were amazed there wasn't some form of music, live or otherwise. Thankfully, the next door Rescue Mission had a live band.Overall, city winery seems a classy place to grab a bottle of wine and cheese plate.  Otherwise, best avoided.",City Winery Nashville,6153241010,5 reviews,2015-04-12,"Atlanta, GA",/biz/city-winery-nashville-nashville-2,2.0,107,"Washington, DC",Daniel K.
"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"What a fun music venue. We saw Bobby Bare and Bobby Bare Jr a couple of weeks ago and it was a fantastic show. It's nice to have dinner options beyond the standard bar fare (ahem, 3rd and Lindsley). The wine selection is as good as you'd expect from a place called ""winery"". A few gripes - we bought VIP tickets and must have been the only ones, because they didn't open that section. They gave us decent seats, but didn't offer to reimburse us. The tables are community, so we got seated with some obnoxious college kids constantly snapping selfies. Service seemed to still be working out the system.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I came here for brunch on Sunday not knowing what to expect. My friend bought a deal on Travel Zoo and we were both pretty excited to actually be able to go out for Sunday brunch, since we are both usually working a brunch shift on Sundays. The place was fairly easy to find, and they had their own parking lot, which is a plus for a restaurant so close to the heart of downtown Nashville.The building was enormous yet beautiful, with lots off wood panels and seating available outside. Their restaurant was fairly full, but it's also spacious enough so it did not feel crowded. They had a full bar, which included wine on tap, and I saw noticed a large party all sitting together, so yes, they are able to accommodate large parties. We made a 12:00 reservation, but arrived 15 minutes early. We were greeted by a friendly manager who was happy to show us to our table, despite our early arrival. We asked him to sit outside since the weather was beautiful, and he gladly showed us to a table outdoors. I felt very welcomed and comfortable.We scanned the menu, which was smaller in size than many restaurants, but I personally find that an attractive feature because it makes decision-making easier We started off with a couple of ""brunch cocktails;"" mine was called the Spanish Violet (I think) which had a very soft violet color, a citrusy taste, and a lemon peel garnish. My friend ordered some peach mimosa, which wasn't bad. I wish I had stuck with a classic mimosa, or maybe the brunch cocktail that had orange juice in it because the more I drank my Spanish Violet, the less I liked it. For an appetizer, we ordered the pastry platter, which came with a wide assortment of delicious pastries, butter, and apple butter. This was probably my favorite part of my dining experience, and I highly recommend starting with this if you dine hear for brunch.For entrees, I ordered the vegetable frittata and my friend had the huevos rancheros. They were OK I suppose, though I would question what they think a frittata is. Both of our entrees were drizzled with might have been sriracha, which I loved, but my friend did not since she is sensitive to spicy foods. We were full after we finished, so redeemed our coupon, received our check, and that's all she wrote.The manager did a great job creating a great first impression, and really setting us up for a wonderful dining experience. If only our server followed suit. My biggest complaint with her was how long it took her to greet us. I had my phone with me, so I was able to check the time in semi-regular intervals since I had somewhere to be at 2:00, and I remember it took our server at least 5 minutes to even acknowledge us. Luckily, the had water carafes on the table, so we did not have to wait for her to drink some water. After sitting down, it took about 10 minutes to order our brunch cocktails and another 7 minutes or so to order our appetizer. I understand servers get busy and weeded, but we were one of three tables outside, and even though inside was busy, they had plenty of open tables, so surely, our server could not have been that weeded.  Luckily, the kitchen was working at a regular pace and there were food runners on the clock because it did not take us very long to get our food. While we were munching on our pastries, our server took our entree order, which was at least 20-25 minutes after sitting down. Afterwards, I only saw her twice; once to actually check on us while we were eating our entrees, and again to deliver the check. On one hand, maybe she thought that my friend and I were the type who needed space, so she didn't have to be around so much, but it was also the way she spoke with us and how promptly she took care of a neighboring table that implied she did not care for us (maybe because we're young? I work in a restaurant, I know how much it sucks to deal with college-aged customers).Our entrees and brunch cocktails were taken care of because of the coupon, but the check was still almost $25 dollars because of the pastry platter (which I knew wasn't included in the coupon) and taxes. Our server ended up charging us for the pastry platter for 4, rather than for 2. I brought it to the attention of the manager, who was the same person who seated us, and he said he would change it. Instead, he took it off of our bill! Overall, I had an OK experience. I would have left four stars if our service was better, but maybe also two stars (perhaps a little harsh?) if the manager wasn't so accommodating. Would I come back? Maybe, but I probably wouldn't recommend this restaurant to a friend looking for a good brunch spot.",City Winery Nashville,6153241010,3 reviews,2015-03-17,"Hendersonville, TN",/biz/city-winery-nashville-nashville-2,3.0,107,"Washington, DC",Christian A.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Headline: mediocre food (for the price) that's overshadowed by really bad service.We had a reservation for Mother's Day, but they didn't have a table ready for us so told us we could either wait or sit outside. It was a nice night, so we chose to sit outside, which was empty except for one table of loud, drunk a-holes. Even though the patio was completely empty, they sat us (a family of 4 celebrating Mother's Day) within arm's reach of the other table. I understand that waiters have sections and want tables close together, but seriously, this was ridiculous. For the first hour of our meal, we listened to them (we had no choice...THEY WERE YELLING!!!) discuss the finer experiences in life...you know, like finishing an entire bottle of vodka in one sitting. Our waiter was a nice guy but never told us anything about the wine, menu, or specials. Interesting, for a place with ""winery"" in the name, that they hand you a wine menu that's longer than ""The Odyssey"" and don't tell you anything about it. Our 4 entrees came out in 3 trips...2 at first, the 3rd about 5 minutes later, and then the 4th about 15 minutes after that. The food was good, but nothing special for comparably priced places (~$25/entrée). The pork belly dish MAYBE covered half the plate.

We ordered both the risotto balls and fried green tomatoes as appetizers. Only the FGT arrived... Cold and overcooked. I asked about the other appetizer and was told we didn't order it! They arrived slightly prior to our meal. We both ordered the pan seared grouper. It was overcooked, rubbery, tasteless and on top of what were supposed to be smoked bacon grits. The consistency was more like soup. Again, we were both disappointed. Sides of mac and cheese and haricot verts... again lacking flavor.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Unfortunately, the valet most likely ruined my experience here.  For starters, there is NO parking available except for some abandoned buildings across the street from the rear of the winery. However, the valet claims to own ALL of these spots and was EXTREMELY rude and even aggressive towards our party for attempting to park.  The valet loudly threatened me that if I didn't try to park on the street he would call a tow truck while I was inside their restaurant. Seeing as how others in our party were waiting inside, (and at this point there was no way I would let the valet near my car) we had to park around the corner and leave the car in front of the Rescue Mission.  When we got in, the bar staff was friendly and we ordered some drinks and appetizers.  We had the fries, the duck tacos, and something else I don't remember.

We got a tasting-sized portion of a house white blend as we were seated - nice! The wine list was a tome - but we weren't really interested in a whole bottle of wine, so we just ordered from the ""on tap"" selection.

A friend and I tried the beet & bacon flatbread because we didn't have much money to spend.

The seats in the house aren't too bad, we were sitting in the back. Their sound guy had the instruments up louder than the vocals making it hard to hear the 2 bands that played. Their lighting was alright. The server at our table didn't show up very often and so we had to sit a while longer than we wanted to just to wait for the check. Also if you don't want to pay $20 cash for valet you have to park on the street and walk a while.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I was surprised with this place! I didn't expect it to be anything great, but it was good! The atmosphere is amazing. Inside is beautiful, wood tables, pretty bar, & then they have a neat music venue where you can eat & listen to music. They also asked you if you would like to try a little of the wine of the night when they seat you, which I thought was a nice touch. Our server was great when it came to picking a wine. He asked what I liked & then suggested one, which was very good. He did get a little overwhelmed with other tables & forgot to check on us a couple of times, but hey, it happens.The food was good, but not as good as it could have been. We had the Crispy Risotto Balls & they were not that full of flavor. Somewhat bland, as well as the sauce that came with them. The Alfresco's Cavatelli was good, but it seemed like it had been sitting out for a minute because when it arrived it was cold & the pasta did not seem cooked well. Also, it most definitely could have used more flavoring or sauce. The menu is somewhat confusing & all over the place. I think I need to go back & try a few more things & speak to the waiter more about the menu options.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Good: A beautiful space, located in an up-and-coming area you wouldn't have wanted to visit 3 years ago. You walk in and immediately feel at home. The whole club, from bar area to bathrooms to the showroom, is intimate without being cloying. It fills a huge gap in this city, which has needed an upscale club inbetween tiny 75-100 seaters (eg Bluebird Café) and larger halls (Ryman). Very clean, great bathrooms, nice bar area. Lots and lots of wood.They're making their own wine next year, and the gigantic barrels are eye candy if you like good vino. The wine lists (there are 2) are comprehensive. Some very reasonably priced , but that's because they charge YOU the liquor tax. Be forewarned.Food is better than expected. Risotto balls, recommended by our waitress, were excellent (though I'd go for spicier mustard). Pork tacos ditto. The steak was two lovely pieces of meat - though the chef has a heavy salt hand. (Maybe they're salting and letting it sit to tenderize? Still, it shouldn't be that salty.) I don't recommend the mussels, and the cheese tray is absurdly small for what you pay, but the ravioli was gorgeous. The burgers are very good, and there's a vegetarian option too.I'd recommend the meze platter, except that we had it our first visit (opening night) and it was large enough for four. Last visit it had shrunk considerably. The bad: Five dollar parking charge? Really? The attendants make it clear that your $5 goes to the venue, so you're expected to tip on top of it. But there's NO street parking!!Getting seated is a work in progress. I've been here 5 times so far, alone, with family, with business associates. Each time, we arrived at 6 pm, when they opened. Each time, wait staff weren't ready. Each time, there's a meaningless cluster of hosts and hostesses? standing by the entry doors, doing anything but paying attention to the customers. Each time we were sent to the ""concierge"" for tickets and information. Forgive my being snotty about it, but how many City Winery employees does it take to seat someone? If it happened once, all right. But every time? Food service is slooooow. Don't come hungry. I don't know if the wait staff are over-loaded or what, but when you go out for an expensive evening like this, you expect better service. My waitrons have all been nice, but far from the kind of competency I experienced at the NY or Chicago clubs.Food is expensive for what you get. (Online menu prices changed?) Our party of four had a bottle of inexpensive wine, 3 Tito's vodkas, and two beers, plus mains and 2 appetizers) was $310 before tip. I think that's expensive. Portions aren't big enough for leftovers. If this were The Palm, I'd expect it, and I'd be satisfied knowing the quality would be wonderful AND I'd have enough for another meal next day. The wait staff are friendly, but scattered. Ask for salt and pepper. Ask again. And again. Finally ask a bus boy, who brings it eventually. My wife's burger arrived with fries, everything looked great, but by the time salt and ketchup arrived everything was cold. This is not unusual here, but I can no longer excuse it as growing pains.And they don't pay the liquor tax?!?! This is the only restaurant in Nashville charging the customers for it - even Kayne Prime, home of 50 cent charge per blue cheese olive in your drink, doesn't charge liquor tax. Really, between food prices and liquor tax, I would not suggest eating here.The ugly:Sound problems. It carooms off the back wall so you can't hear vocals at all if there's a band - of the 3 we've seen, this was a problem with all of them. It's all right for an acoustic act like Taj Mahal, but something needs to be done. Who opens a club in Nashville without consulting a sound engineer? Everyone in my party, each time, was disappointed in the sound quality.Seating is, to put it bluntly, horrendous. At first glance, it's very pretty - until you realize that a) no matter where you sit, you're not facing the stage, and b) chairs are tiny, and tables are about a foot shy of the standard 2 or 4 seat table length. What this means is that no matter how much you pay, or what you reserve, you're going to be miserably uncomfortable. My wife is petite, our daughter is likewise, but even they complained that they couldn't eat without elbowing one another. The sideways-only seating means you don't get to enjoy the show the way you would with concert-style. I understand you can't do the concert-style and serve dinners, but I'd love to see this place change up so half the table is facing the stage. The other half could just turn their chairs around for the show. As it is, no one was happy with the seats.All in all, I will continue to attend when I'm in town, because they're bringing in a lot of acts you wouldn't normally see in Nashville. But I'll dine elsewhere. And I'll try to get validated, even if I'm not a ""vinofile"" (because I resent paying $75 a year for what I would get), and I'll avoid ordering liquor.",City Winery Nashville,6153241010,144 reviews,2015-05-07,"Utrecht, The Netherlands",/biz/city-winery-nashville-nashville-2,2.0,107,"Washington, DC",Krash T.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"4 people for a 7:00 reservation.As I got out of my car at Valet, I was informed that CITY WINERY was charging $5.00 for parking, and that did not include the tip. When I asked, the valet person told me I could pay them on the way out.  Arrived about 6:40 and had some great cocktails at the bar. We were seated at 7:00 and informed that the restaurant was closing at 8:00 for a private function..WTF!!  That information could have upset somebody on a date or out for a nice evening, but we are long time food service professionals, and figured out that the event probably started at 9:00.  Nobody ever pressured us to ""order up,"" but at 8:15 they started moving tables and chairs around us.We started with the cheese board and the Falafel.   Both were about as predictable as tap water..it's good when you are thirsty(hungry), but not very exciting.Around the table for dinner we had:The trout---apparently very satisfying.Chicken fricassee--the grits were blandWaygu beef tartare--over processed, DRY, flavorless beef.  The sweet corn and charred scallion relish didn't help. I think they forgot the mustard seed aioli and the cured egg shavings.Hummus plate--nice hummus.   I'm positive that the peppadew feta was replaced by the peppadew ricotta because it had none of the sharpness of feta cheese.  I did not see the pickled eggplant, and it was replaced with some kind of sweet honey like concoction.Buratta---it was a glob of bland watery fresh mozzarella, with none of the buttery flavor you might expect.  It did melt nicely.  It was in a small cast iron serving dish, with halved cherry tomatoes and some mild green peppers.  it lacked the pickled garlic and sunflower seed pesto that the menu promised.Speaking for myself, nothing came to the table piping hot, even in the cast iron serving pieces. Nothing was an assult on the taste buds (except for the tartare) , nor was anything memorable.  The menu reads a lot better than the actual food tastes.  I am not sure if the missing food items would have helped.I realize that the weather has been bad, but if something is on the menu and not going to be on my plate, let me know and I can work around that.We were asked about seeing a dessert menu, but it was difficult to think they were being sincere about offering it as they picked up tables and chairs around us.When I picked up my car at Valet, I was never asked for the $5.00.  Not sure what that was about.It was a pleasant evening because the people I was dining with made it pleasant.

Some folks have complained about parking; our tour guide mentioned that as soon as construction is complete they are going to add a parking lot with space for about 60 cars, to alleviate that ""forced valet"" option. Which I have to agree, was probably the worst part of the visit. We also got to see the private dining rooms which would be great for small events, and we saw the room where they will eventually make their own wine.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I was told to visit City Winery by a friend who frequents their New York location and I was not disappointed! From the moment we walked in we were treated like VIPs.  Hosts were there ready and waiting to greet us and we were escorted immediately to our seats. I definitely recommend coming in a little bit before the show to eat because the servers seemed a little overwhelmed after the show started (but they still did an excellent job considering how crowded the room was). As far as food goes I HIGHLY recommend the cheese plate. It's the perfect amount of food if you're not starving and literally everything on the plate goes amazingly with everything else...(I immediately went home to attempt to recreate the dish and failed miserably)The show itself was AWESOME (but when are the wood brothers anything less than fabulous?) and our view was actually a lot better than I was expecting it to be (our seats looked father back on the floor plan) I do concede that the lack of parking forcing you to pay $7 to use the valet was somewhat annoying, but apparently there's a membership program you can join to waive the fee..

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I really wanted to give this place more stars, but I can't for a few reasons:1) as everyone else mentioned, the $7 for valet is way too pricey.  I can see charging that if it really is a perk, but since you basically have no other parking options, it's not a perk, it's a requirement.  Most other places in Nashville have free valet, and I'm willing to tip well if that's the case.  But $7 on top of then a tip? that's kind of crazy for these parts.  And while I'm willing to do it for a show, but that price will definitely impact whether or not I decide to go to City Winery for dinner.2) The food was good (my chicken dish was very good) but some things were overpriced.  ""Smoked Avocado Dip"" was just guacamole with chips (as a previous commenter noted, the chips were way too weak to hold up to the chunky guac, too) and wasn't worth price tag based on the serving size.It was a good evening, though, and it seems to be a good alternative for Nashville's live music venues -- I liked the upscale feeling and the ability to eat and drink while suffering through opening acts waiting for the headliner : )  It seemed they were really trying to impress since they're new, and the staff was conscientious.Over all, though, I probably won't be back until there's a concert  I can't live without.  It was an expensive night, and I'm not sure it was worth the price tag.",City Winery Nashville,6153241010,2 reviews,2014-10-23,"Nashville, TN",/biz/city-winery-nashville-nashville-2,3.0,107,"Washington, DC",Joan W.
"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"A beautifully created night spot. It's a perfect 10 on the ""cool"" rankings. However I probably won't be back and here's why. I went to a show there recently in the upstairs portion. For ""regular folks"" like me, drinking the the basic house wines are plenty adequate.  That way you can get your cost per glass under $10 and not feel like you're getting ripped off too bad. Well, the waitress explains that they don't offer their house selections upstairs. You have to order from the rest of the wines starting at $40 and going way up from there. This is BS and they know it. They don't offer their cheaper menu to patrons of a show because they know those people are a captive audience. They aren't going anywhere and they are going to order something, so why not put the screws to them and remove the cheaper portion of the menu? Great business sense! Well, you got me once but that will be the last time. Additionally, my tab came out to $59 after I ordered only the one $40 bottle of wine. They were trying to run us out of the place the second the show ended so I didn't dispute it. I just signed it and left. Too bad because it's such a neat place.

"609 Lafayette StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"We managed to get ticket for 2 of the 3 sold-out Jason Isbell shows here in December. We were really pumped, because I managed to get great seats on the first night (4 seats back from the stage). The wife is a huge fan, so she was incredibly happy about the seats and the show. Unfortunately, we happened to be seated next to a VIP investor in City Winery, who didn't happen to know dooku about the talent on the stage. Typical bloated businessmen with trophy wives (one of which was Googling Jason Isbell during the show and blurted out that he had ""Played with the Drive By Truckers""). You know these kind of businessmen: hang out at cigar bars, eat at Mortons, and live in the Governors Club. Thankfully however, they realized that they didn't really care for the artist on the stage (other than the fact that someone told them how ""great"" Isbell is, and they had to see him for prestige reasons), so they left half-way through his set. Bonus for us, we ended up front row!Onto the place itself!1) Service. Our server was great! In fact, I don't think there is a bad server in the place. They manage to be unobtrusive yet attentive at the same time. They also manage to maneuver through the seating area without disrupting the show (the same can not be said of bloated businessmen!).2) Venue. The venue is really classy, clean, has a great feel and even better sound. Given the tasteful use of recycled and new wood both inside and out, the backdrop for the stage is a bit corny (City Winery logo on plywood set against a gray Corian panel),  But who cares. You get a great show!3) Food. This is where they need some help. We just had a few appetizers. Risotto balls and truffle fries. Neither was all that tasty. They weren't bad. They just lacked flavor. Maybe the entrees are better? But the prices aren't that bad. You'd hope they have some better stuff to go with the great wine options. Speaking of which...4) Wine. Well, wine is their schtick, so let's talk about it. We tried a few of the ""on-tap"" wines. The Syrah was good. The Malbec is better. They sell by the glass, by the carafe or half-carafe. The prices aren't bad on these, UNTIL YOU SEE THE CHECK!!! This may only apply to the the house wines which are dispensed from barrels, but they charge you separately for the Liquor By The Drink (LBTD) tax, which is 15%. I'd like to say I KNEW if it only applied to tap wines, but our server (who was otherwise great) served us tap wine on our second night instead of the bottle wine I ordered. To do the math for you, if you order the $42 carafe of Malbec, you'll be paying $53 after 15% LBTD tax and another 9.25 % sales tax. ANYWHERE else in Nashville, brewers, servers and distillers include this tax into the price of a served drink. There's a tiny footnote on the back of the menu that mentions this tax. So, if you don't like surprises, be sure to ask your server if the tax applies to all beverages, or just barrel wine.If I could sum it all up under pros and cons:Pros: Great wine, great service, great venue, excellent staff all around, good prices on food.Cons: Wine taxes are brutal, food needs a bit more flavor, valet parking when the show gets out looks to be a real CF.

You can get street tacos at El Tapatio, though they aren't very good at either of the two locations.  But they have great plates like Alambre, Plato Loco et al., which are VERY GOOD!  I would give this 5 stars, but they don't have the usual Mexican offerings, so can't compare to some places in CA or TX that I've been to. PS: Don't expect a bowl of chips and salsa.

The few places we stopped at before said they didn't serve them so we were pretty happy when this place said yes! I think their version of breakfast tacos and everyone else's are quite different. We asked for simple potato, egg and cheese and bacon, egg and cheese tacos. First we were told they didn't have potatoes. Odd... When we asked for bacon they kept telling us chicken (their English was not that great so I'm assuming they were having a hard time understanding us as well). They finally understand that we wanted bacon and said it would be awhile on the eggs. Ok...so 10 minutes maybe? I mean, how long does it take to scramble eggs? TOPS?! We waited 30 minutes with one other table inside to get 6 tacos. Seriously. To boot the bacon was terrible. It was translucent, not cooked all the way and you can tell it was bacon scraps from the fat that is normally cut off and tossed or used for grease.

El Tapatio was chosen essentially at random from all of the well-reviewed taco trucks / restaurants, and a good choice it was!I bought eight tacos, one of each type, to go. $10.93 later I headed to my car and drove back home to surprise my wife with a tasty treat.We each ate half of each taco. I thought the best was the tripe. She thought one of the porks was the best (it wasn't the ""spicy pork"" (pastor), but whether it was the ""pork"" or the ""pork meat"" is left an exercise to the reader. It wasn't shredded, and was very flavorful). We agreed that the goat was particularly tasty. We both thought the chicken was the worst - a little boring. We agreed that on the whole, the quality was excellent.The salsas packaged with the tacos were both amazing, though a little spicy for my wife (considering she spent a couple years in Mexico City when she was small you'd think she could handle it, but no.) I liked the roasted chile red salsa the best; unbelievable flavor.I would like to go back and actually sit down - the dining room was actually pretty comfortable and I didn't get a dive feeling at all from it.

"3611 Nolensville PikeNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"Taking a suggestion from a new friend, my husband and I swung by here after work on Friday to start the weekend off right! I am so sad that it's taken us this long to discover El Tapatio! Everything we were told about this place was true. It's a bit of a hole in the wall, but I LOVE that and the food certainly did not disappoint.While I was a bit upset at myself for not remembering more of my Spanish, it was easy enough to communicate with our waitress by pointing things out on the menu. I ordered three chicken tacos and my husband ordered a chicken burrito. We were not offered any chips and salsa, but after reading Steph H.'s review, I can see why...we should have known to ask! (To be remedied in the future!) My tacos were OUT OF THIS WORLD! The cilantro, crispy smoky chicken pieces, onions, fresh lime and small corn tortillas were the perfect combination of yumminess! So fresh and light tasting...I could have had three more! At $1.25 a piece, that wouldn't be hard to afford either! My husband's burrito was delicious as well. I was surprised to see they used sliced avocado in it and you had to specify cheese. He couldn't finish it all as it's a good portion for only $5! We also shared a glass (as big as your head) of their horchata and it was delightful! Only $3 and we had to take it to go as well.The place smells amazing and the ambiance is very casual. There were about 10 TVs (exaggeration) playing the same soap opera and I wasn't quite sure of the necessity of that many TVs. Oh well. They weren't loud so that wasn't distracting.I've been looking for a place like this for quite some time! Happy to know it is so close!

"3611 Nolensville PikeNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"This is hands down my FAVORITE Mexican place in Nashville. My husband and I have been going here for about a year now and we have not once been disappointed. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food, El Tapatio is all you need.For those who have only experienced Tex-Mex/Americanized Mexican food, the fare offered at El Taptio might initially seem surprising. The food is not slathered in thick/heavy sauces, nor does it contain very much cheese and sour cream is non-existent here. What you get instead is food that is incredibly fresh and very hearty, but never heavy. The tacos are akin to the ones you would get at the various taco carts around town: two grilled corn tortillas about the size of the palm of your hand filled with onions, cilantro, and the meat of your choice. Sounds simple, but it's so good! My favorite tacos are the lengua (tongue!) and the tripa (tripe!) - if you think you can't stomach stomach, think again! The tripe here is crispy nuggets of pure deliciousness. Still, if you'd like something a little less exotic, you can't go wrong with some spicy pork or the chorizo (the latter isn't listed on the menu, but you can ask for it and they usually have it). If you're looking for something more substantial the tortas (sandwiches) and burritos are super filling and very reasonable at just $5. I love the birria burrito (goat stew), but again, you can get any of the more conventional offerings like chicken, steak, or pork. The burritos come packed with rice, beans and avocado along with your meat, while the sandwiches have the same fixin's as the burritos plus lettuce, tomato and melted cheese. If you come with more than two people they tend to automatically bring out chips with salsa and guacamole--all for free!--but if they don't you can always ask for them to bring you some. The salsas that they bring out are smokey (the red one) and picante (the green one) and very good. Your tastebuds will quiver in delight since it's unlikely that you've ever tasted restaurant salsa that has this much flavor. You can also order beer, various softdrinks (including Mexican varieties), but you definitely need to try the horchata (rice water with a healthy dash of cinnamon). It's so tasty and will help you deal with any spice overload.It's true that Spanish is definitely the preferred language here, but don't let that dissuade you because many of the waitresses do speak enough English to get your order right. The food is so good that a little pantomiming is definitely worth it! There are few places in town where you can get such a delicious and filling meal for under $10, but El Tapatio is definitely one of them.",El Tapatio,6154457781,136 reviews,2011-02-17,"Toronto, Canada",/biz/el-tapatio-nashville,5.0,50,"Washington, DC",Steph H.

(I know Spanish, so miscommunication wasn't a problem).  I'd probably say this was the worst dining experience I've had in Nashville.Cute building and you get to watch telenovelas which is a plus.  I didn't order the food some others are raving about so I'll give em 2 stars, but I can't say I'll be going back.  I don't know if they are under new management, but there are plenty of other options on Nolensville (La Hacienda, taco trucks) which are better choices.",El Tapatio,6154457781,4 reviews,2012-01-06,"Hamilton, NY",/biz/el-tapatio-nashville,2.0,50,"Washington, DC",David G.

"6000 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37205",3.5,"We went here with a Groupon. We paid $66 for $120 worth of food. Not a bad deal. We got four appetizers. Cheese plate, olives. Scallops, & duck meatballs.

My wife got the homemade pasta. My burger was excellent and great sized along with very good roasted potatoes. The $20+ price tag was excessive though. My wife's portion of pasta was tasty but seriously not more than 3/4 cup for almost $30. We both got dessert. I got the fig and caramel cheesecake which was very good. My wife got a chocolate ice cream cookie dish. The cookies were very hard and not good at all. She said the ice cream was good though. The restaurant is small and very stocked from floor to ceiling with wine. The staff were very attentive and polite. The food came quickly and we were overall satisfied.

"6000 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37205",3.5,"TL;DR -- Messed up our wedding reception big time. Terrible communication. No leadership, no one took responsibility, no one made it right. Terrible experience.My bride and I booked the private room at 360 Bistro months in advance for our small wedding reception. We had been there previously to try it out, and their food and service were top notch (if exorbitantly expensive), so we thought it would be a sure thing.Let me start by saying, anyone who has ever been married or planned a wedding knows that there is so much that goes into it. So much planning, so much money, and when things don't go right it can be heartbreaking. Thus begins the tale of our experience at 360 Bistro.About a month out from the wedding, my bride calls 360 to just make sure everything is still good to go. They inform us that the person we had been dealing with no longer works there and they have no idea what we are talking about. So we showed the the correspondence between us and them and they agreed to honor the terms. It seemed like crisis was averted. Fast forward to the night of the wedding.We arrive post-ceremony to find that they had booted us out of the private room. No call, no email, no communication of any kind. They not only did not have us set up in the private room, they put us back in the corner in the server's prep area. They didn't even have enough tables or chairs set up. So here we are, us and our wedding guests wondering what in the heck is happening. Immediately we begin to ask what is going on. The manager never came to us to talk to us. She simply ignored that we were there. The wait staff tried desperately to cover, but they knew it was wrong. They stuffed us in to this tiny corner where I didn't even have enough room to pull the chair out for my bride to sit down.Appetizers were already supposed to be prepared (we specifically asked and had someone come early to make sure they were ordered), they weren't. So all of us had to wait for those. The food was delicious as we knew it would be and the servers, while it appeared that they had never been to a wedding or hosted any sort of party there ever, did an admirable job with the debacle. On top of all of the aforementioned gaffes, they informed us that they would be charging us $2.50 PER SLICE of our own wedding cake that we brought which was not previously disclosed to us. They then proceeded to take the cake without even asking us and cut it into GIANT pieces. This was a cake made to serve 40-50 people. They cut it into 20 slices. Hundreds of dollars down the drain as no one could finish their cake. To top it off, they did not leave any for my bride and I to have! Imagine having to console your new wife who is in tears over all this, and not a manager in sight to even apologize for confusion.To end the night we asked for some satisfaction. We were told succinctly that we would not be receiving any sort of discount and were required to pay the full price. After the huge amount of money we spent, one would think we would get at least an apology from the manager. We did not.As you might imagine, I will not be patronizing their establishment again and will actively encourage others to dine elsewhere.",360 Bistro,6153535604,10 reviews,2015-05-05,"Nashville, TN",/biz/360-bistro-nashville-11,1.0,87,"Washington, DC",Jesse G.

"6000 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37205",3.5,"We went to 360 Bistro for a celebratory birthday lunch during Icepocalypse 2015. The restaurant was EMPTY, and I figured that would only improve our experience in terms of service and food, but that assumption was WRONG.We had a glorious cheese plate and a nice glass of wine, which initially tempted me to throw them another star, but they didn't make that cheese or wine, so I don't really think it makes up for the shitshow that followed. After receiving some guidance from our waiter, I ordered a chicory salad with lardon vinaigrette and poached egg ($13), which I topped with shrimp ($8). That vinaigrette was perfect, but I did essentially pay $13 for them to throw it on a bowl of frisee with a handful of croutons and an egg. Whatevs. Unfortunately, my bacon vinaigrette experience was ruined a few bites in when I took a bite of my husband's lunch. He had ordered the tempura-battered shrimp tacos, but swapped the shrimp for fish, as suggested by the menu. Surprisingly, the fish was not tempura breaded. Even more surprisingly, it was PUTRID. I could barely return to my wonderful salad after a single bite of his fetid, lukewarm, fishy taco. We're not the sort of people that return dishes, but that taco was offensively bad, and I suggested he return it. He told me that he'd mention something to the waiter if asked.Unfortunately, the waiter didn't ask, even though my husband left two tacos on his plate and declined to have it boxed to go. Had he asked, we would have mentioned that we were more than displeased, perhaps even shocked by the level of our disgust at the tacos. I don't enjoy writing crappy reviews without giving someone the chance to remedy the situation in person, but honestly, that fish was unforgivably bad.

"6000 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37205",3.5,"For the past 6 years I have lived about 2 miles from 360.  I recently read where USA Today rated 360 as one of the top 10 places in the country to wine and dine. Last week I finally decided to make reservations to celebrate my wedding anniversary.  I'm not sure why I waited so long.The atmosphere is chic and a little trendy, but not pretentious.  I wasn't sure what to wear, so I went with the standard khakis and a button down.  There were others in shorts and t shirts, and they seemed to fit in just fine. For appetizers, there were four that we wanted to try.  We finally decided on the tuna tartar and the calamari.  The tuna was beautifully presented and absolutely delicious.  If I were into taking pictures of food, this one was picture worthy.  The calamari was a standard fried calamari.  It was nicely cooked, not too chewy, and the remoulade was outstanding.As an entree, I had the tri tip, which was served with bone marrow, sauteed rapini, and a chimichurri.  The steak itself was perfectly medium rare and with the proper chew expected from the cut of meat.  The gelatinous part of the marrow didn't add much to the dish, but the rendered marrow fat had great flavor, and tied all of the other components together.  The rapini was slightly bitter, which went well with the other components of the dish.My wife had a grouper special.  I was a little surprised to hear another server present the fish as halibut to a table behind us.  When the dish was presented, there was no mistaking that it was grouper instead of halibut. The fish was well prepared, and went well with the reduction that accompanied the dish.  This was a fine dish, but probably not something we'd order again.The desserts may have been the best part of the meal.  I had a vanilla panna cotta with strawberry sauce.  My wife had the warm chocolate cake with salted caramel and  espresso ice cream.  If it wouldn't have cause a scene, I think it's safe to say that we would've licked our plates.The service was prompt and friendly. Our server was nice and conversational, but not too over bearing. She was also very comfortable making recommendations off the extensive wine list, which is presented on and Ipad app.Overall, we enjoyed our experience.  It was a nice change of pace from the other locations that we typically celebrate special occasions.   When a friend asked my opinion after the meal, I told them that 360 would be a great place to drink wine, and nosh on a variety of the wonderful appetizers and desserts.",360 Bistro,6153535604,68 reviews,2014-07-30,"Nashville, TN",/biz/360-bistro-nashville-11,4.0,87,"Washington, DC",Jason B.

"6000 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37205",3.5,"I have come to this restaurant several times with my family and we have all said that we love this place. I come up from out of town about 2-3x a year to see my family and we always make it a priority to come by at least once per visit. (yes, it's that good.) We absolutely love the service here. It's such a nice and cozy place that allows the interaction between the phenomenal service to be intimate and pleasurable, without being too much conversation. The wine list and wine by the glass list on the Ipad are spectacular with wines from throughout the world. I do believe they have one of the most comprehensive wine lists in the southeast if not the country. We asked the servers and they had a great working knowledge of the extensive wine list and suggest an excellent wine to pair with our meals. Now the meal was absolutely fantastic I had the butternut curry butternut squash soup and it was just the right consistency and flavor to be on my top lists of curry butternut squash soup. For the main course I had Wasabi Pea Crusted Ahi Tuna Steak and it was perfectly cooked paired nicely with the kimchi slaw and wasabi aioli! Overall, this has been one of my favorite restaurants in the area for at least 7 years.

We went there on a Saturday night and were surprised at the premises. For as fancy as the place is, it's QUITE small. There was hardly any space at the bar and there's nothing to do around that place so we waited around for a table to clear. That being said, we were early for our reservations so that's our fault not their's. Finally, when we were seated at 8:30, our waiter told us all about the specials. We went in with a $48 Groupon that offered $96 of food and he told us that we could eat and drink anything (including alcoholic drinks!) up to that amount. We were very excited to hear that. :) We each had steak with vegetables. The food was mouthwatering! The drinks were delicious as well. The best part of it all was their amazing creme brulee! It was the best in town, no doubt. The customer service was also great. Two hours later, we left with full bellies and smiles on our faces. Overall, amazing customer service and delicious food.

They ran out of the dessert I wanted, which is okay, except for that if they make you order it in the beginning of the meal, they should account for the numbers. Instead of telling me that, they just brought out all of the other desserts, dumped them on the table, quickly explained and walked about. I guess this is an okay way to deal with it, but I would have much rather they just asked what I wanted instead of giving me every dessert. However, it wouldn't have mattered...because we tried all of them and they were all bad. I don't know how 4/4 desserts can be bad or mediocre at best.3) So overpriced, for mediocre food.4) My boyfriend got filet mignon, and asked for it rare.

I only wished that we had saved our money on all the mediocre meals that we've eaten in the area & had come here sooner. The newest chef came over from Miel (another place we love). I have not a single critique on our meal. So delicious. The wine menu is incredibly impressive & I love that they offer half glasses, in case you need just a bit more to get through your meal. My 5 year old devoured her gnocchi and I pretty much licked the short rib tagliatelle off the plate.

And this place has it all.They let my friend and I in at 430 because it was relatively chilly outside, and they didn't open until 5.  They brought us our wine early, and the kitchen offered to open up at 445 for us.So, ambiance - well it started out quiet for us at about 5pm.  Then, within the hour of the place opening, it was jam packed. This was a Sunday night. Sooo many people were there.  Amazing service. The servers and hostesses all worked together to clear off tables and greet/seat people.  The restaurant is small so they aren't having to cover too large of distances. They really had a group feel to their work ethic.  Sit in the heated patio area when it's chilly. that was wonderful.Our server was hilarious, knowledgable, and provided the perfect recommendations.  He knew all his wine pairings and hit the flavors I liked spot on.  The wines were amazing, but very expensive.  At least for me on my poor, college student budget. regardless, I paid my $200.00 with a smile because this whole experience was phenomenal. Anyways, the servers were great. I drank the Oregon pinot noir called Cumming Road and that was delish. had the best dusty/smoky feel at the end. really enjoyed that with my pork chop... which came with pancetta, green beans, apple butter, and goat cheese cornbread. mmmmm. so juicy. the glaze on the porkchop was perfecto. mmmmphf.the appetizer we had was the fried calamari which was okay, nothing to RAVE about. I was starving, as was my friend. We snarfed the whole thing down, but the marinara was nothing special, neither was the fish. very plainly done Italian style. But - I liked it regardless. My friend ordered the short rib with broccolini and parmesean polenta. that was delicioso as well. mmmmm. so tender. sauce was perfect. broccolini cooked just right.and then, we bought a bottle of Kiona to go. mmmm. drank that back at the place we were staying... delish cabernet. I liked the pinot noir, but I prefer much dryer wines. For dinner though, the pinot was fine.dessert was the trio gelato scoops. we had berry, coffee, and mint.  biscotti came with. I wouldn't get this again. the ice cream was flaky and weird textured. flavor was good, but the texture was not for me. ambiance was very professional/classy in my opinion.  Dress nice, it seems kid friendly, but I didn't see a ton of kids.. didn't see much on the menu for kids either.music choices were great as well. it's always nice to have sweet background tunes.overall, you can't go wrong here. check it out, splurge, and enjoy. it's not worth the trip to 360 if you aren't going to splurge. so do it. go big or go home. sorry for the cliche, but that's just how its gotta be at the 3-6-0.",360 Bistro,6153535604,42 reviews,2013-02-18,"Chicago, IL",/biz/360-bistro-nashville-11,5.0,87,"Washington, DC",Maya C.
"6000 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37205",3.5,"I have been impressed with a few Nashville restaurant menus featuring local fare, grass-fed meats and outstanding plating presentation.  However, when it comes to Bistro 360, they take the cake when they take on and wonderfully execute the aforementioned.  Local produce, Grass-fed meats from Cox's Farm and Gold's Farm, the menu entices locals and travelers alike.If I had a motto it would be, ""Try everything once, even if you don't go back for a second helping.""  That said, if duck liver pate or a white anchovy dressing doesn't have you looking forward taking your next culinary plunge, maybe a Handmade Potato-less Sundried Tomato Gnocchi with Lump Crab or a Sweet Tea-Brined Pork Chop will.I have only had the potato version of gnocchi before and was blown away by the silky texture of these.  Served over watercress with a lightly acidic lemon butter sauce that weighed down not one bite of the huge chunks of crab, I was in such 'awe' by this dish I almost had to pick my jaw up off the floor upon swallowing my first bite.3 words:  Goat.  Cheese.  Cornbread.Yes, I said it.  I ate it and loved it, too.  Accompanying french green beans and crispy pancetta, topped with a juicy pork chop and served atop a savory apple puree, my 'borrowed bites' weren't enough to fulfill my needs... this is THE dish I will be getting myself upon my next return to 360 Bistro.Long wine lists seem daunting?  Don't let this one be.  Your server will know exactly how to serve you and how to answer your questions.  Go ahead, test his/her certified sommelier knowledge!From the top: Ample parking, friendly seating staff, very knowledgeable servers and a tremendously chic ambiance & atmosphere.  Gorgeous--and I mean gorgeous--plating, equally enticing and deliciously delivered local food, and perfect wine pairings.  On the pricer side (most especially if you have alcohol on your bill or dare to try a succulent dessert) but worth every single penny.",360 Bistro,6153535604,62 reviews,2012-11-14,"Nashville, TN",/biz/360-bistro-nashville-11,5.0,87,"Washington, DC",Charli J.

Not only was there not many options, but they ran out of certain items. I started off with a tuna carpaccio style appetizer that was passable at best. My ""filet mignon"" was brought to me well done when I asked for rare and was DEFINITELY not a filet. I'm not sure what cut of meat it was, but it was grainy and impossible to cut with the steak knife I was never given. On top of that the rest of the accoutrement was inedibly under spiced. Finally, the kitchen ran out of the dessert item we ordered at the beginning of the meal and we were never told until the end of the meal when they brought out the other options and just dropped them on the table. Don't get me started on how they failed with my girlfriends meal. In addition the cocktails we both ordered were poorly mixed. Over all I was incredibly disappointed.

"6000 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Today's Lesson: Customer Service ... and lets not talk about the calamari (eek).This bar is known to have some pretty high rollers frequent through so I shouldn't have been surprised when a co-worker and I were treated like peasants. Not many people inside, besides a few well dressed gentlemen with their lady friends here and there, so we figured we would receive great service and be able to eat within no time.. sooo not the case.. We ordered a lemon-meringue martini, which was ABSOLUTELY AWESOME, but unfortunately the bartender seemed very disinterested in serving us. I figured that maybe she was having a rough day or something so I paid it no mind at first... We politely waved her over so that we could order the calamari appetizer. She went from skinning and grinning in some old guy's face to looking at us as if she had a nagging dog biting at her ankles. Not sure if its because we lacked Rolex's and tailored suits or what... but I felt as if our business wasn't appreciated due to the fact that she assumed that we weren't going to spend any money. SMH! I guess this ism could be labeled as classism. NEVER AGAIN will I visit.-P.S.

"6000 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37205",3.5,"A restaurant of course but I always sit at the bar. Being a drunk i always feel more comfortable actually sitting in view of the bottles I am knocking down one gulp at a time. This great space located just off the corner of the Hillsboro Center. They have a great 'happy hour'  from 4pm to 6pm. $5 martinis and 1/2 priced apps. A great deal. I tried the Mango Margarita but ended up in love with the 'Pumpkin martini'. A tasty elixir topped with freshly grated nutmeg.In addition to the great bar here what I liked was the scene, yea, its a milf scene. Much like a riverbank can become host to all types of oddities and treasures that flow through the arms of a river, 360 Bar is at the end of Belle Meade, Chickering, Harding and Tyne Blvd, modern rivers of pavement all. What flows through these areas and into the 360 bar isn't the runoff, gravel or sediments that one might find at Applebees or Waffle House, but gems, diamonds, rubies, the lode of Nashville's femininity, sanded and polished at St. Cecilia and Harpeth Hall. Bored housewives in need of a drink. Its a beautiful thing. These girls take care of themselves, no spandex or Lane Bryant here..It seems that it was important to meet the chef, Aaron, a lot of patrons there were visiting with him, a nice enough guy. He's supposed to be a magician in the kitchen, perhaps even a mad sorcerer.  On my first night here I ventured no further than the 'burger with fries' with a side of Gorgonzola, naturally. It was great, outstanding.

"6000 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Celebrated a wedding anniversary here last night and the experience was very pleasant.  Ordered the calamari - which my husband and I considered to be one of the top 10 calamari appetizers we have ever had - and we order it everywhere almost every place available.  He ordered the halibut special which was great and I had the burger which has a hint of sweet bbq and the fries are served in a miniature fry basket.  Well worth the $20.  Unfortunately, they were out of the wine my husband ordered so he substituted and it was not quite up to par at $25 for each glass - the wine was more expensive than our entrees.  Next time we may bring our own wine even though they charge a $25 corkage fee.  We would also be able to enjoy the wine at the proper temperature.  Overall, very good experience and the servers (especially Josh) were very attentive.  We will be back making minor adjustments.",360 Bistro,6153535604,13 reviews,2013-08-27,"Nashville, TN",/biz/360-bistro-nashville-11,4.0,87,"Washington, DC",VIcki T.

They use iPads to search their wine selection - which was pretty cool. Our wait person made a good suggestion and decanted the bottle for us. We had the calamari appetizer - very yummy!

"6000 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37205",3.5,"As some of the other reviewers have posted, we went there with our Groupon and were very excited to try something new, out of our neighborhood and a place that has the variety of wines as 360 does. Having looked at their menu online, I fully expected to spend upwards of $150 on a full course meal to include bottles of wine. We made our reservation and away we went. My first impression was ""weird location"". But hey, location isn't EVERYTHING right? Wrong. We sat outside on the patio as it was a nice night and were really distracted by the traffic noise coming from the bridge directly above the parking lot. One star, deduct. Our server, who I wish now I had written down her name, was AMAZING! Very attentive, explained the wine list and made lots of suggestions. We ordered our app and had a problem with our tiny table and the GIGANTOR wine book....no space. Dealt with that. Venison spring rolls came out in less than 5 minutes. HUH?!?

"6000 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Sojourned over to 360 Bistro this past Sunday with future husband to celebrate completing our wedding invites in record time, thanks to some help from our friends.  We also had a Groupon to this place that was set to expire soon, so why not? We were seated in the patio area (heated and cozy!) and given an IPad to peruse the extensive wine list -which is totally what a place like this would need in order for patrons to not feel overwhelmed by selection (or to be burdened by a dense wine list). We ordered our drinks and then I ordered the flounder special, while FH ordered the broccoli soup and Bistro burger. As our waitress began to walk away she remembered that there was a cheese plate on the dessert menu that people often ordered as an appetizer. We took the bait and I'm so, so glad that we did. In all honesty, we would go back for simply a nice glass of wine and the cheese plate. Our plate had five cheeses with the standouts for me being the beer cheese where one could see the beer marbling the cheese and the blue cheese/cheddar combo. It was a great way to start the meal. The soup came out and was a bit bland...it probably was the low point for the meal. Some pepper helped brightened it up, but it was still a letdown in comparison to the rest of the meal. My flounder was cooked perfectly and tasted yummy, though I think our waitress got some of the elements mixed up with the other special when she was describing it, as it didn't have everything on the plate that I was expecting. FH's burger was pretty tasty, though he removed the bacon halfway through, claiming that the fatty portions of the bacon hadn't caramelized leaving him to chew a bit more than he liked. We finished off the meal with a trio of sorbet - strawberry, white peach, and chocolate. All were well-received and a nice note to end the meal on.

"6000 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Here's why the restaurant only gets 3 stars. First, I don't mind paying a little more for good food; my wife and I like do that every so often, to splurge a little on ourselves. We're not rich and can't do it much, so we seek out places that have strong reviews. That's why we went to 360 Bistro: the reviews are good. The thing is, the restaurant didn't live up to the reviews. Here's why. First, when I pay a hundred bucks for a meal, I have certain expectations. One is that the food will taste good. Bistro 360 lived up to that expectation; the food quality was good. Not excellent, not even very good. But it was good. The problem with the food was the quantity. I don't expect huge portions in expensive restaurants; it's a given that you sacrifice quantity for quality (while paying more, though some restaurants, i.e. Sunset Grill, accomplish both). I ordered the steak of the day. It was a flat iron steak, which I don't think is a 5-star restaurant cut of beef. Honestly, it's what I'd expect at at good Mexican restaurant. The beef had a nice tendon right down the middle and was not as tender as I expect in an entree at that price. But it wasn't the cut of beef that was disappointing. It was the sides. It came with potatoes, squash, and zucchini. I had two one-inch slices of potato, and maybe four or five each of the squash and zucchini. And the side wasn't all that good. My wife ordered the fish of the day, marlin ""caught off the coast of Ecuador"" (an extraneous explanation that I honestly thought was a bit pretentious). It was good, very tender, and she had a larger portion than I did; her eggplant side, however, was mushy and over cooked. But all of that is only worth a one-star deduction. The other star comes from the wine. I like good wine. My wife loves to taste good wine. Unfortunately their Merlot we ordered was old and stale, and at $12 a glass that simply shouldn't be the case. It tasted like something from a $12 bottle of wine and was a big disappointment, particularly in a restaurant with such an extensive wine list and strong reputation in that area. But I've seen this in other restaurants with big wine lists: the wines don't get drunk as quickly, and it's very easy to have a bottle go stale, which was the case with our wines. Overall the experience was okay. We had no reservation (we went because the power was out at our house and we went on a whim) and the staff accommodated that (granted, it was a Thursday night, but they still made room for us). The waiter was very professional and service was excellent. Unlike a lot of places, Bistro 360 is made for conversation; it is an easy place to sit and talk, and I never felt as though I was being rushed through my meal. It wasn't noisy despite the crowd, and the decor was very nice. Bottom line: it was a good place to eat, but simply not worth the money. I've heard that it's a good place to go at happy hour, and they have a good reputation for wine tastings.

"6000 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Though my H and I had been to 360 for drinks before, this was our first time having a full meal there, in part courtesy of Groupon. I made reservations at 7 pm on a Friday, but when we arrived, our table was not available, and we were told it would be about 10 minutes. After a quick trip to Harris Teeter next door, our table was ready, and our waiter greeted us with a couple of complimentary glasses of champagne to make up for the wait, which was certainly a nice touch.Because they rotate their wine list regularly, the off-going wines are reduced in price, so we ordered a 2003 Summit Lake Vineyards Howell Mtn Zinfandel off of that list, which was fabulous.The soups of the day were both chilled: a potato-leek and golden beet soup. Neither my H nor I are big soup people, but they sounded delicious, so I ordered the golden beet, and he got the potato-leek. The golden beet soup was very mild and the presentation was beautiful. Little swirled bits of red beet gathered in the center adding some color and bite. My H loved his potato-leek soup as well.For our entrees, I ordered the fish of the day: yellowfin tuna with spring ramps and fiddlehead ferns. The tuna was cooked perfectly. It was probably about 1 1/2 inches thick with a light sear on the outside and almost cool on the inside. I could cut through it like butter, and it was rich and fatty on my tongue. It came with the most complex, delicious sauce which appeared to be made of honey, wasabi or horseradish, and cilantro. The ramps and fiddlehead ferns were a nice accompaniment, and the presentation was beautiful. With every bite, I just wanted to close my eyes and let all the flavors wash over me.H ordered the rabbit, with the meat falling off the bone. It was the most tender rabbit I had ever had. The pieces of rabbit were arranged with some mushrooms, baby carrots, and small onions.We couldn't stop there so we ordered dessert. I ordered the trio of sorbets: mango, blood orange, and blackberry-yuzu. It also came with mini-madeleines, which were tough and chewy; the only downside of our meal. The blood orange sorbet was my favorite, very tart with a hint of sweetness.H picked the Granny Smith Apple and Bacon Fritters. They came out smelling like funnel cake, and the bacon added just a hint of smokiness and maple flavor.The service was perfect. We were in no rush and let our server know that we wanted to take our time and enjoy our wine. The pacing was ideal. The atmosphere is modern but comfortable, and the clientele is mostly Belle Meade couples. We looked to be the youngest ones there. It was not cheap, but it was certainly a fine dining and service experience.",360 Bistro,6153535604,41 reviews,2010-04-10,"Nashville, TN",/biz/360-bistro-nashville-11,4.0,87,"Washington, DC",Kira S.

The wine list (66 pages) is unparalleled in Nashville and has received a Wine Spectator award of excellence.  Over the course of dinner, our table of 4 had 3 bottles (an Italian prosecco, French rosé, and a red blend from Washington), all of which were outstanding.  Because this was NYE, the menu was a 3 course prix fixe.  I'm typically not a fan of a prix fixe menu, but this was a very interesting menu.  Our table of 4 made varied choices and we tasted several different dishes in each course.  The beef short rib was the standout entrée.  However, the highlight was the caramel crème brulée with a maple goat cheese sauce and sweet potato chip -- a savory touch to a usually very sweet dessert.  Overall, the food was perfectly prepared with interesting flavors.  I look forward to trying the standard menu and we will be back soon, even if just to grab a burger and a glass of wine on a weeknight.",360 Bistro,6153535604,39 reviews,2011-01-01,"Franklin, TN",/biz/360-bistro-nashville-11,5.0,87,"Washington, DC",Cole D.
"6000 Hwy 100Nashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Wow, this was THE BEST FOOD, SERVICE, AND WINE I've ever had in Nashville!  We were completely surprised, neither of us had been to 360 Bistro before, and I've driven by it a hundred times.The atmosphere is quite nice - the lighting was subdued, which I like - not too bright, not too dark.  And the tables are in two different areas, so people are not all in rows as in some restaurants.I ordered the mixed greens salad, my husband had the Caesar.  I think they were both absolutely delicious!  Caesar salad is an art in my opinion, and I believe his salad was one of the best I've ever tried.  My salad was excellent as well.For the entree I ordered the Black Cod with Fennel and Blood Orange.  OMG!  The cod was crispy on the outside and melted like butter on the inside - incredible!  And with the fennel and blood orange, it had a nice sauce.  I wanted to lick the plate clean.My husband ordered the mussels as an entree, but it is considered an appetizer.  The plate was loaded with muscles, probably 25 or so - big order for an app.  He said it was the best plate of mussels he'd ever eaten.  It was not the ordinary white wine/garlic plate you get in an Italian restaurant, but were cooked with Chorizo sausage and onions and were unique and absolutely delicious.We didn't order dessert (it started snowing so we wanted to get home), but they have chocolate souffle on their menu, which I love.  So we have to go back!The service and wine were impeccable!I highly recommend 360 Bistro!  I've been to pretty much every restaurant in the Nashville area, and this was by far one of the best meals I've ever eaten in this city!",360 Bistro,6153535604,13 reviews,2010-12-25,"Lake Mary, FL",/biz/360-bistro-nashville-11,5.0,87,"Washington, DC",T.

"407 49th Ave NNashville, TN 37209",4.5,"Ok, it is no surprise that a dive bar is my favorite. I love them. And finally I talked some friends into going on a dive bar hop. Not bars that used to be dives but have been taken over by college students and ironic hipsters, but real dives. Enter Betty's grill. Ah the simplicity is what really works it out here. Nothing fancy just cheap ass cold beer, a couple of bowling video games, a cast of characters with an age range of 30s to 60s, tables, smoky atmosphere, and a jukebox playing old country. You can sit and drink in silence or you can bring some friends and make a night of it. Betty's doesn't care. They do have a bar menu with sandwiches and such. The BLT was tempting and I bet it comes out like one your momma would make you at home.

If so, you will be deeply conflicted about Betty's Grill, sort of like you're Hamlet.This place is a cheap bar where you can smoke inside. The ""locals"" come here. By that I mean I walk here and a bunch of folks who dress like my dad came here and drink and play arcade games and shout and laugh and listen to ""Now You're Messing With a Son of a Bitch"" and enjoy themselves. It's great for things like that. Or it was great, anyway. There was some local music from a guy I realized is my neighbor. Pretty soon the locals all drove home because they work tomorrow and this bar isn't the Stevedores Local from The Wire. This is real life. And I sat there drinking and laughing and telling stories and having fun. And it was cheap. And it was good.And you know what? In a twinkling of an eye, this place will be transformed or gone or recontextualized. I used to live next to Bobby's Idle Hour, a close relative of this place (the Springwater will also do as a comparison). And now that place has regular folks passing through and songwriters night and hipsters and all of that. And I think that's wonderful. And I hope Bobby's stays around. And I think Betty's Grill will do well too. I don't think they'll go under just because MLRose is up the road and Hattie B's is going up kitty-corner. But something is changing. And maybe it's only because in a place like Betty's Grill, archaic as it seems, that I can get a glimpse at that, but I can see how this place would be exciting and sad and a bunch of other things depending on who you are. This place teeters on a nexus of shifting space. You are living between if you drink and eat at this bar.So come on down to the thrift shops and such, and have some cheap beer and a burger and watch time happen.

For example, owners, please sweep and wipe up tables before sitting down in the dining room to eat your own meal. Customers deserve to eat in a clean place. Use real kalamata olives, and real lettuce cut by hand, not dried out iceberg in a bag and put out a real, flavorful cucumber yogurt sauce. And warm the pita bread up on the flat top or grill.

"1414 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37203",4.5,"This place is such a great value.  It's very no-frills, but if I want a quick pita sandwich, I'm not interested in decor; I'm interested in the food.  The lamb looks really juicy and delicious, but I haven't had it, as I'm vegetarian.  It's very tantalizing as it turns and drips its savory juices.  I notice that many people buy chicken.I usually get the falafel sandwich with a side of hummus.  The sandwich is generously sized in a pita that is chewy, soft and warm.  The falafel is firm but not hard and has a nice, round taste.  They stuff it with whatever you want, like fresh tabbouli, peppers, hummus, feta, etc.  Then they put more pieces of falafel on top, drizzle tzisiki so it seeps through the layers like rain through shale, and sprinkle it with yet more cheese.  Sometimes it's a little messy to eat, but you really shouldn't care.  The hummus plays it safe and isn't anything particularly special.  It has a good texture, though, and I can taste hints of citrus.  I'd appreciate a little more garlic all around.  At least for the falafel sandwich combo (sandwich, side and a drink), it's a steal at $7.  This thing keeps me full for hours and hours.",Nashville’s Best Chicken & Gyros,,35 reviews,2012-06-22,"Nashville, TN",/biz/nashvilles-best-chicken-and-gyros-nashville,3.0,11,"Washington, DC",Will Y.

"73 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"Located in the same shopping center as Barre 3 and J. Alexander's, I can easily imagine Golden Thai being overlooked. I stopped by for dinner on a random weekday night and found it rather empty at 630pm. We ordered the Hung Ray Curry (mainly because it wasn't listed as just a red or green curry and we had never heard of it before) and also a basil, beef noodle dish. Both dishes were good, but not particularly memorable. We enjoyed the fact that the they truly delivered on the spice level we asked for. No joke. I do think I will need to come back to try other dishes people have raved about such as the green curry and the chicken larb wraps.

I'm sure that the generally favorable reviews on Yelp have contributed to the improved business.I'd place Golden Thai as my second favorite Thai spot in Nashville.  Their spicy basil dishes are my favorite.  They'll make it to your preferred level of spice, and you can customize your order with meats of your choice.  You'll receive a complimentary bowl of soup and egg roll, all for about $8.  Not a bad deal for lunch.  They also offer a nice variety of curries and other Thai classics.  If you are looking to mix up your lunch routine, you will not be disappointed with Golden Thai.",Golden Thai,6153539411,68 reviews,2014-07-22,"Nashville, TN",/biz/golden-thai-nashville,3.0,51,"Washington, DC",Jason B.

"73 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"Luxurious, rich and decadent hung ray curry with cashew nuts and fresh ginger sticks tossed on top. This curry is sweet, salty and tantalizing. It reminds me somewhat of a Panang curry, with slightly more ginger.  Perfectly cooked fried tofu - lightly crisped outside, succulent soft middle. When you order the hung ray curry with tofu, ask for ''tofu and vegetables'' instead of just the tofu, and you'll receive delicious broccoli and cabbage as well. I always get 3 stars on the spice scale and ask for the spice tray. I love dousing my curry in a good smattering of fragrant, tiny red and green peppers and fish sauce. Aey was our server for years on an almost weekly basis and he never missed a beat. Whether we ordered a three course dinner with beverages or just a simple lunch special, Aey's courteous, friendly demeanor set the tone for many wonderful dining experiences at Golden Thai. He would go the extra mile often, even ensuring that our takeout orders were ready before we arrived with an adequate amount of napkins and little to go containers of peppers and fish sauce. His friend Ao even wrote out our names for us in Thai! The lunch special here is hard to beat and comes with the soup of the day, a fried spring roll (with sweet plum sauce, delicious!), jasmine rice and more than enough hung ray curry! But is there *ever* enough hung ray curry? It has a nice, relaxing ambiance too.

"73 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"NOT A FAMILY FRIENDLY RESTAURANT!!!  YOUR CHILDREN ARE NOT WELCOME HERE!!!!We love Golden Thai's food and have been eating here about 2-3x per month since we discovered it about a year ago.  Normally we do take out but have occasionally dined in without incident.  Today we had the absolute WORST experience that I have ever had at an eating establishment that deserves to be shared so no one has to feel the way we did.  We decided to dine in today instead of take out and showed up at 4PM as they were opening. The restaurant was completely empty, no other customers. We asked for a table for 3 with a high chair for our 18 month old daughter.  Immediately when we sat down it seemed as if something was off as the waitstaff was not friendly- she took our order without smiling or making eye contact.  She didn't bother to ask if our daughter needed anything to drink.  When she brought our food to the table she placed piping hot food directly in front of our daughter.  We really just shrugged all this off and went about eating- everyone has bad days here and there.  Our daughter was really enjoying her meal and being well-behaved.  Then out of nowhere one of the male waitstaff (who is always at the restaurant but was not waiting on us that day) abruptly walked to our table, put a large paper towel in front of me and said in a rude tone, pointing at my daughter, ""THIS IS FOR HER, KEEP IT CLEAN"" and walked off with a scowl on his face and not another word.  My husband and I just sat there in disbelief for a minute or two until we realized what had just happened.  Our daughter was being a typical 18 month old, eating with her hands, dropping a few things on the floor (she was eating a noodle dish so some of the slippery noodles weren't making it into her mouth) as any toddler would, but by no means being unruly or intentionally making a mess.  At this point I was very upset, informed the waitress it was clear we were not welcome and asked for boxes so we could take our food and leave.  It was obvious we were upset and no means were made to rectify the situation.  On they way out the door we stopped and had a few words with the guy who made the rude remark to us.  I told him this was NO WAY to treat a customer, that we were frequent fliers that would now not be back and that we would be sharing our experience with others.  He tried back peddling a bit but really did little more than say ""ok fine."" and that was the end of it.  Needless to say, we will not be back. I've worked in the restaurant business waiting tables for several years in the past and am by no means ignorant to restaurant etiquette.  We arrived early before the rush given we had a small child and didn't want to disturb others.  We clean up as we leave and generally tip 30% for the extra work that comes with serving a family with small children.  NEVER IN MY LIFE have I been made to feel so unwelcome in a restaurant and NEVER IN MY LIFE would I imagine to treat a customer in such a way.  We will now be on the search for a new Thai restaurant to frequent that isn't bothered by the mere presence of children.  SHAME ON GOLDEN THAI!!!",Golden Thai,6153539411,1 review,2014-10-10,"Nashville, TN",/biz/golden-thai-nashville,1.0,51,"Washington, DC",Melanie O.

"73 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"Great Thai food - and with off the menu items too.Moving from NYC to Nashville it was always going to be a challenge to find great Thai food - we tried the usual suspects, Smiling Elephant etc without truly enjoying them and came across Golden Thai purely by chance when shopping at Target on White Bridge Road.Our server, Oh, was delightful, recommending some great dishes.

Alexanders.  Although the sign said ""OPEN"" it looked pretty empty but I went on in.  It wasn't just empty, I was literally the ONLY PERSON THERE!  It was like eating at a restaurant after the end of the world...I'm the only survivor!  In their defense, I didn't show up for lunch until 1:45pm so I don't think it is all their fault - I just eat at off times on the weekends.So let's say that the service was attentive and excellent since I was the only patron.  I got to sit where I wanted, I got my water promptly, and the waitress helped me choose between two things.  I can't remember the official name of what I got but it had stir fried onions, green bell peppers, carrots, and baby corn in a brown sauce.  You have the option of mild, medium, hot, or Native Thai spice and I ordered it hot.  It comes with rice to soak up the sauce.  So I was extremely pleased with the food that came out.  The veggies were so fresh, crisp, and tasted so good with the perfectly hot sauce.  The heat was hot, burn your mouth, but not burn your mouth so hot you can't taste anything else.  I really enjoyed this dish and almost wished there were more to enjoy (oink oink!!).  I also liked the fact that since the place was empty I could eat in peace and read my kindle to my hearts content.  Not too shabby.  Prices for the entrees were a little bit on the high side considering it was lunch and I was alone but it was really tasty enough that I didn't care at all.I am pleased to find this easy to get to, easy to park at, delicious to eat at Thai restaurant so close to my house.  I will definitely be back when I get the craving for Thai food - and I suspect my cravings will occur more frequently now!!",Golden Thai,6153539411,1027 reviews,2011-07-31,"Nashville, TN",/biz/golden-thai-nashville,4.0,51,"Washington, DC",Nickie G.

"73 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,This Thai food was terrible!  The pad thai was tasteless and had the texture of glue.  The Massomon curry was floury and bland.  We hardly touched our food and left hungry because it was simply so disappointing.  Will not return.,Golden Thai,6153539411,2 reviews,2013-11-30,"Nashville, TN",/biz/golden-thai-nashville,1.0,51,"Washington, DC",Mia R.

"73 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"I've already said that my favorite Thai is Jasmine in Cool Springs, but Golden Thai comes in a close second. It's probably a more authentic Thai experience. If you're a bit of a wuss about spice, make sure you order mild, because when they say hot, they mean hot. My friend who went with me found this out the hard way as she shed tears all over her meal. Good for her though - she stuck it out because hot as it was, it was still ""very tasty.""The soup is phenomenal, full of lemongrass and basil and shrimp. I would recommend that and the spring rolls.

"73 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"The other reviews are so positive! I don't know if things have changed in the last year (since most of these were written) but my lunch was beyond disappointing.I got the spicy basil stir fry, a generic dish I know, but I wasn't feeling too adventurous today. The best word I can use to describe it is juvenile, as in any college student with 15 minutes, some frozen ingredients, and a large handful of salt could have made something similar. It wasn't spicy first of all despite its very name. The presentation was haphazard and resembling mall Asian fare or cafeteria food. It's nice that the entrees are served with a cup of soup, but despite the numerous visible ingredients all I tasted was the chicken stock (now to be fair on that one I don't eat chicken so I might have been a bit sensitive to it).The decor said nice business luncheon, but the food said Drive Thru.

"73 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"I've been to Golden Thai for both lunch and dinner and have had consistently excellent experiences every time.The decor is simple, muted lighting, white tablecloths with glass tops. The cushions at some of the tables add some bright colors, but the overall effect of the atmosphere is crisp and clean without feeling sterile. I wouldn't necessarily call it romantic even though there is candlelight, but I had no problem taking my sweetie there.I usually get one of the curries as my entree--there are five to select from, and I always have trouble choosing. My last time there, I chose beef with cashew nuts and ginger, and asked for it ""native Thai"" hot--you can choose on a five-point scale.Meals start with a clear soup, which as been slightly different each time I've been there. The flavor of lemongrass is a staple of said soup, sometimes with still-crispy bits of cabbage, other times with the subtle nutty flavor of tofu. The  fried spring rolls are light and flavorful with a delightful sweet sauce for dipping.Portions are comfortably sized with plenty of fresh ingredients. The veggies have obviously not been soaking in the sauces, so they keep their crunch and add layers of flavor to their individual dishes. The curry with cashew nuts was loaded with julienned ginger and nuts to the point where I got some of each in almost every bite, and my lips and tongue burned pleasantly throughout. If you like spicy and flavorful, this is the place.For dinner I recommend the duck in red curry sauce--the hottest of the bunch, or the seafood combo.My only quibble is their location, White Bridge is a little out of the way for me, which certainly isn't their fault.

As I have previously stated, 3 weeks in Thailand has made me a serious Thai food snob, and though every place since my trip pales in comparison, Golden Thai is about as close as it gets in Nashville.

I love spicy, like seriously spicy, and this is the only place that actually makes my food spicy when I ask.

"73 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"I hate to be the first to give this place a not so great review. To be honest I really wanted to like this place and very much expected to  walking through the door. The place is clean, well lit, has great art work, and even ""floor"" seating. When we walked in the place was empty except for one other table. I had been craving curry and tofu and so I ordered the Massman. We also both ordered a cup of hot tea. They brought us a teapot of the jasmine and two cups. (One weird thing about the tea was that we were charged for two hot teas. Which wouldn't be weird except that individuals had the same size pot of tea just minus one cup.) The curry was good and had a lovely flavor but the tofu was terribly lacking. There was about half as much of it as expected (or as compared to other places with similar prices), It was cut into tiny cubes, and it wasn't quite as well cooked as I would have liked it. (keep in mind that i'm pregnant and tofu was what i was craving).  At some point during our dinner the flood gates opened and the service went completely down hill. Think no refills and the phone ringing off the hook with no one to answer it. We waited for a long time just to get our check (we even out right asked for it but were ignored by our waiter ) and finally had to get up and go to the hostess at the front to pay. The hostess then had to track down our waiter (okay the only waiter) and go through all of  the other checks to find ours. We finally escaped. I do want to go back and try again.

I was the only customer in there at 11:30 so the service was very quick and attentive, which is always appreciated when dining solo. I had their lunch special of the day, which was a half of a Classic or Nashville melt and a cup of soup. I opted for the Nashville melt, which had pimiento cheese, Benton's bacon, and jalapenos. It was a tasty combo, but the bacon could have been crunchier to make it easier to bite into and there could have been a touch more cheese. It just wasn't quite spread to the edges.

"4117 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",4.0,"I seriously debated for quite some time whether to give 4 or 3 stars, but for my first experience here, I do have to say it was just ""A-OK."" I love the entire concept of a late night dessert cafe which I've longed for many times in Nashville. Goozy gets it right with solely focusing on sweets for that late night crave. I love that they also have a small food menu if you're more than just dessert-hungry. Also, I thought they wouldn't have any cocktails since they opened up only a few weeks ago, but I was proven wrong. Their sippable menu actually looks solid. I know that Goozy still has some kinks to work out. I definitely want to come back and try their other desserts and hopefully when I do, things will be smoother and I will post an updated review at that time.So for my experience here... I drove in to the parking lot and saw the huge billboard sign that was lit up with ""Goozy."" Super cool. BUT. Under its name, it said ""coming soon"" so that sort of confused me since I knew it had already opened for at least a few weeks. I loved the interior, atmosphere, and the menu design. However, one thing I noticed about the menu was that there was a heck lot of chocolate treats. I'm more of a berry/fruit/vanilla kind of gal and the night I went I wasn't quite feeling chocolate so my choices were left to four options under the specialty desserts. All the Goozy cakes were chocolate cakes, so I felt a bit left out in that area. I'm not quite sure if Goozy cakes are supposed to all be dark chocolate molten cakes (?). I ended up ordering the Pot de Creme with a side of Cinnamon gelato. This is when I started feeling a bit uneasy about things here. I ordered this mainly because the menu said it comes with ""fresh berry compote."" I wanted this for the berries (!!!!). I finally got my order and ... no berries :(. I thought it might have been tucked inside the custard, but no. All I got was chocolate custard and the cream on top in a small cup and my gelato. 1. the gelato was fantastic, 2. the custard itself was not too sweet (just how I like it), but a bit thicker than I expected, and 3. no berries :(((((((. I politely asked the server whether I was supposed to receive berries with my order and she went back and checked for me. She ended up bringing me a small side of the berry compote (I really liked it!!! Could only taste sugar from the fruit, so nicely done) and saying that the menu was printed wrong and the fresh berry compote was supposed to be for the item above. I looked back on the menu and the item above Pot de Creme is the Crostata. I'm pretty sure the Crostata isn't supposed to be eaten with fresh berry compote... So not really sure what happened here.Something else I'm confused about - I read an earlier review here in which a scoop of gelato was added to the S'mores order for only $1. When I ordered my gelato along with my specialty dessert, I paid $3 for that addition. What is correct since I didn't see anything written out on the menu about adding gelato for just $1? :(((((My partner ordered the Raspberry goozy cake which we both liked. Also ordered amaretto gelato which was SO YUMMY. Overall, good service, ambiance, and gelato flavors. For a dessert cafe, though, I did expect a lot more out of my specialty dessert since I felt like I paid $6 for a small custard cup of plain chocolate cream. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing or the most boring dessert item. Anyhow, I want to come back, try the skillet cookie and eat more gelato. I'm hoping they'll have these little issues I pointed out solved by then.",Goozy,6152970274,81 reviews,2015-01-04,"Memphis, TN",/biz/goozy-nashville,3.0,36,"Washington, DC",Christina C.
"4117 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",4.0,"WARNING LONG POST AHEAD! :-) Our night was a disaster. Much to our dismay our group of 7 could've made out better eating at the Wendy's next door than dining at Goozy. Arrived at 6:30pm for a friend's bday celebration and a couple minutes in two ladies sitting next to us whispered in my friends ear that they hoped we would actually get our food tonight. Apparently they ordered a cheese plate, drinks (which one of the ladies asked for a refill on her wine that never came) and they also ordered dessert and THAT never came, so they left. Now stay with me it gets better!We started to worry, and was it warranted! Our sandwiches took 40 minutes for us to get. Sandwiches. A Tuesday night. One of my friends orders was wrong (it happens) and she had to wait another 20 minutes for a BLTC with no cheese! How hard is it to put together such a thing? And another warning: do not get a side salad instead of chips bc all it is-is a spring mix with dressing drizzled on it.... No tomatoes, no cheese, not a single crouton, just lettuce. For a 2 dollar up charge! I would've much rather stuck with the chips and just not have eaten them which is basically what I did with the salad. And my friend and I both ordered the BLTC and there was no ""L"" on either of ours.... No one had much to say about their dinners. Honestly nothing special. Oh and we ordered dessert in the middle of eating bc we knew we'd have to wait... We didn't get our desserts until after 8. Most of them were good. The lemon pudding one was our least favorite. I only ordered gelato... As I was getting near the bottom there was a HUGE long piece of straight hair in it that I coincidentally was pulling out of my mouth as the server came up to our table. Thankfully our server handled that well and didn't charge me for it.The bread pudding came out with no gelato or syrup on it so we had to track down someone to ask for that. It was just a mess. How do you forget two main ingredients on a dessert at a place known for desserts? It's a small place and the tables became full after we ordered yet we were the last ones to get anything. Just seemed very disorganized. Our waitress was nice and apologetic to us after one of my friends finally spoke up bc not only did we wait on our food, but we waited forever for our checks. It was just one disaster after another. To make things go a little quicker we decided to each go up one by one to the counter and pay for our meal individually. Another friend was up there and the waitress was ringing her up; meanwhile, the manager (we didn't know she was the manager) asked how everything was- my friend just said ""ok"" then proceeded to talk to the waitress who was again apologizing... My friend was saying to the waitress that it was just a shame bc we had high hopes for the place. Then the manager got snippy with my friend saying- ""Wait a minute, you just told me everything was ok and now you're saying it wasn't?! I need to know these things...."" Not sure what else was said exactly, but she was rude to my friend and did not show good customer service. Sorry for the long post! So much went on that I just had to get it all out :) it's safe to say that we will not be returning to Goozy.",Goozy,6152970274,6 reviews,2015-04-22,"Nashville, TN",/biz/goozy-nashville,1.0,36,"Washington, DC",Megan K.

"4117 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",4.0,"We went here because Goozy was featured in Nashville magazine as one of the 37 best places to eat, and because the reviews on Urbanspoon and Yelp appeared to solidify that ranking.  Either Nashville has really low standards or we're missing something entirely.It's not that Goozy is TERRIBLE.  I think the concept is ingenious, seeming to be geared towards parents with kids (saw lots of kids, had a couple of my own) and giving something to everyone.  I also happen to be a big dessert fan, so Goozy definitely sounded right up my alley.  It's the execution that needed help.Some of my hangups:- our server repeatedly forgot to bring out drink orders, we never received a refill on water- our server/bartender wanted to make a fruit cocktail out of my Old Fashioned, but thankfully I've come across more than one inexperienced bartender and saved it from a terribly syrupy demise.  though i can't help but speculate that she thought i was crazy for requesting a real Old Fashioned, and not her muddled version- i was told (without asking) Benton's bacon is sourced locally.  it's actually made outside Knoxville, and I'm really questioning just how local that is.  not that it matters, but don't tell me you serve food sourced from local farmers if I would have to spend a whole day just to get to the farm.- my creme brulee had virtually no taste.  i LOVE creme brulee, and if its on the menu, I'll order it.  But this one seemed to lack taste and consistency (a bit lumpy).- service took an extraordinarily long time bringing our desserts and getting us checked out.All of these things made for a very lackluster experience, and I suppose I had higher expectations for a place touted as one of Nashville's places to eat... it was all just very forgettable.",Goozy,6152970274,47 reviews,2015-04-21,"Bowling Green, KY",/biz/goozy-nashville,2.0,36,"Washington, DC",Joshua S.

We've been to Goozy several times already and have loved everything about it.

We got the roasted root vegetable salad as a side to our sandwich, and it was *fantastic*. The wife got the mac and cheese which had a good blend of cheese, giving it the right balance of sharpness and richness. The serving portions were just the right size to make sure we had room for dessert! The Goozy molten cake can best be described as a cake wafer that is covering a ramekin of molten chocolatey goodness (flavored with raspberry or Nutella if you wish). The chocolate comes from Olive & Sinclair and is dark, decadent, and delicious. We have also sampled their croissant bread pudding (topped with whiskey caramel sauce, pecan brittle, and Jack & honey gelato)  as well as their Nutella waffle cone sundae (topped with cardemom soil).

"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"It's a good place.  I've been here twice, but the first visit was years ago, so going off my latest visit.  The parking is a bit tricky, there aren't a whole lot of parking available, since there are stores nearby that need the parking as well.  It's in the middle of Vanderbilt, so parking can be a bit scarce, although there is plenty of police around the place if you feel like being given the right to park on the main road for a fee and a free pep talk.  I ordered out from the place, and I have to say, the food was good.  It's not my favorite in the city, but it's open a bit later than usual, and the portions are pretty big.  The restaurant is a bit on the small side, so inside is a bit congested, especially when there are a lot of people around.  The service was also good, the person that handled the order (I believe was the manager) was friendly as well.  I ordered a decent amount of food because I was coming back from a trip, so needed to restock the fridge, until I worked the magic in the kitchen (or ordered out again).  I'm vegetarian for the most part, so this review doesn't deal with the meat, poultry, or seafood section.  First up to the plate were the samosas.  They were fairly large, and tasted good.  It has nice flavor, and the dip was nice, which is the standard tamarind and the green chilly sauce.  It's samosas, so unless you slept or bribed your way through Indian Culinary school, it's not hard to screw up.  Batting second were Onion Bhajia.  These were good.  They are not the best I've seen, but I haven't seen this option anywhere else in Nashville.  And I love these, so just by having these gets a special place in my heart.  The Malai Kofta was decent, albeit it needed a bit more flavor.  There was plenty of it to last about 3 days, and it goes really well with the rice they serve you.  It's great with naan as well.  The Malai Kofta is probably my standard curry order at most restaurants that serve it, so it was nice to see that Bombay Cafe had a nice tasting option.   The Aloo Paratha wasn't that great however, I think it was definitely hard to bite into, felt as if I needed to sharpen my teeth halfway through the meal to chew it.  The taste wasn't amazing, but I think it was just heightened by the effort it took to chew through it.  Overall, I think this is a place that falls in the 3.5 star category, but since they had one of my favorite options in the Onion Bhajia, I had to bump it up to 4 stars, since I like that they differed a bit from the standard choices around there.   I think this is a good place to check out every now and then, when you need some Indian food in the city.  It's not the best, but from the ones I've tried, I think this is second on the list in Nashville.",Bombay Palace,6153216140,50 reviews,2015-02-07,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bombay-palace-nashville,4.0,239,"Washington, DC",Alvin P.

"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"Food: Papadum--as soon as we were seated, they gave us two baskets of papadum (a thin, crispy fried flatbread) and some sauces and chutneys to go with it. All of the sauces were delicious and I liked that papadum wasn't overly filling the way bread is (I tend to get almost full on bread at American restaurants and not have as much room for the main course).Garlic naan--I ordered a basket of garlic naan which came with 3 pieces. Great flavor of garlic and herbs and a good price at $2.50Shrimp bhagari--I was trying to decide between two shrimp dishes and the waiter recommended the shrimp bhagari. Definitely a good choice--it was a creamy, tomato sauce that was slightly sweet and tangy. I'm generally not a huge fan of Indian because I find a lot of the different curries to be overwhelming in the use of different spices and have a muddled flavor profile but this dish was more up my alley. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and despite being in this sauce full of Indian spices, the shrimp stilled retained its sweet, shrimpy quality. All of the entrees come with basmati rice which went perfectly with the entree.They have a heat scale of 1-10 and I ordered mine a 3 which ended up not being spicy at all. I tried my friend's dish which was a 9 and that it wasn't insanely hot as I thought it would be. If you want some actual heat, I would recommend ordering something higher than a 5. Mango lassi--what can I say, I've never had a bad mango lassi and this was no exception. I like that they put ice in theirs as I've had practically room temperature mango lassi at Sitar (the other Indian place near Vanderbilt) before.Price:This place is definitely on the pricey side--the dishes are in the $13 to $20 range and the portions are fairly small. My shrimp dish was $15.95 and came out in this small copper dish in this special holder with a candle under it. I wish there had more pieces of shrimp (I think had 6-8 pieces) as it was mostly sauce. However, despite the small portion, you do end up being pretty full because you eat it with the rice. So I didn't leave the meal hungry by any means but it did feel like I paid mostly for rice.Service:Very friendly wait staff. When we asked for more papadum the waiter said ""no problem, I'll bring that right to you"" but are food came just a couple minutes after and I guess he forgot about the papadum but no biggie. Otherwise, they were super friendly and informed us that the rice was complimentary and unlimited so when we were low on rice and asked for more, they brought out more right away.Environment/Ambience:The decor was that of your typical old-school Indian restaurant. The place was pretty clean and they wiped our plates with how towels right before placing them in front of us which I appreciate because I've been to plenty of Chinese/other Asian restaurants that using super dirty dishes and silverware.*Overall positive experience, despite being a bit price I would definitely come back because practically all the Indian restaurants in the area are around the same price range.",Bombay Palace,6153216140,2 reviews,2015-01-18,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bombay-palace-nashville,4.0,239,"Washington, DC",Vivian H.

It's very good.  We have ordered 4 different curry dishes, two chicken and two lamb. Every dish has been very flavorful and spiced how we ordered it. My husband usually orders medium or spicy.

The food is always delicious, from the complimentary pappadam with chutneys and raita at the beginning to the mango lassi a creamy, fruity cold drink which in my opinion is best saved for dessert.My favorites on the menu are many: if you are looking to avoid the calories that come with the delectable sauces, definitely go for the chicken tikka, flavorful and bright red from the yogurt marinade, tender and juicy from the tandoori oven. Served sizzling with onion and peppers, it is a guilt-free choice that leaves you sated. If you aren't counting calories, amp up the volume and go for the chicken tikka masala, served in a spicy, creamy, fiery red (in color only, unless you specify otherwise) sauce. The korma is excellent. Your choice of protein served in a rich, nut-based sauce perfumed with spice. The vindaloo is also delicious, as are the saag paneer, madras, and most other items you might choose. The only time I ever had anything that was less than wonderful was when I ordered a broiled chicken dish that was flavored with mint and other spices. It was traffic light green, which was ok, as it was from the green herbs, but the meat was just a bit dry, unusual for Bombay Palace.I have never been there for lunch, but apparently it has an amazing buffet where you can experience many of the dishes listed above, for a budget-pleasing price. Which the dinners also are, by the way. At $13-$15 per entree which provides enough food for dinner and lunch the next day (especially since they give you extra rice when they pack your box), ordering off the menu is also extremely affordable.",Bombay Palace,6153216140,78 reviews,2013-06-07,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bombay-palace-nashville,5.0,239,"Washington, DC",Diana S.

"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"things have changed alot, and for the better with the new chef. Sitar used to be the best buffet close by. now, hands down without question the best Indian in town is Bombay.the lunch buffet is about $10. it has a good selection. the chicken tikka masala is excellent and the best in the local area. the vegetarian dishes (such as saag, etc) are excellent as well. obviously, Woodlands Indian is going to reign supreme as the vegetarian king, but Bombay is great as well. I am an avid fan of Indian food, and have had Indian in large east coast cities (where there are larger Indian communities). but Bombay stacks up quite well in comparison. even the little things are great: the unlimited, oven fresh naan; the fresh, cold, crunchy onion chutney; the tangy sweet tamarind chutney that is perfectly seasonedif you order off the menu, the food is even better. the portions are large.the service is excellent. obviously when it gets crowded, it's hard to take care of everybody perfectly. but at most times, my glass is constantly refilled and the naan keeps coming.I am genuinely impressed.

Courteous, professional, and prompt. They have their timing down so that you never feel over whelmed or forgotten. And I am a sucker for any waiter who gladly takes your leftovers and boxes them for you. Always a nice touch. The space they are in though is a little cramped. Cozy though. Good for a date, I feel like it would be bad if you had a party of more than 4.The food is good. Quality Indian staples (or at least what an American would expect to find) AND they serve goat!

"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"I went for the $10 lunch buffet. It was AWFUL. The staff were very kind and helpful in pointing out which dishes were vegan (on my visit, two entree dishes and one appetizer, plus rice and naan). Mainly, the food was lukewarm and stale. The cauliflower fritters were probably pretty good right after coming out of the fryer but the batter was kind of soft and tough by the time I got to them, which was only mid-way through the lunch service.The cucumber salad was a large bin of shredded iceberg lettuce with about 4 thin cucumber slices left. There was apparently no intention to replenish that, as I made three passes and it looked just as sparse and sad as the first time around. (Come on, all you had to do was slice up like TWO cucumbers.)That was one of the most depressing restaurant meals I've ever had, second only to takeout from Satay Thai Grill the night before. In both cases, it wasn't due to lack of vegan selections, but rather, the mediocre quality of preparation. If it hadn't been for the unlimited naan, I probably would have left the restaurant feeling genuinely angry. Granted, this was an AYCE buffet, but it's also the only thing anyone in the restaurant was eating, so it seems like a little more effort would have been in order.There seemed to be a fair number of regular diners at Bombay Palace when I was there so maybe I caught them on an off-day.

Basket after basket after basket kept showing up. That mint chutney was delicious too! Just not too many different meat options. Mostly chicken and a fish dish among the veggie dishes. The place was super crowded with a wait and no open tables. The kicker, it was all for $10. And for me, that is what bumps my overall experience from a 3 to 4 star rating.

"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"I'd read a few of the reviews about the change in ownership at Bombay Palace, so I wasn't really sure what to expect last night.  Indian cuisine is my favorite, but I don't have it very often because the best restaurants in town are a bit of a drive from my house.  (And I've tried to cook it myself, but I just can't pull it off.)  So last night I visited Bombay Palace for a belated birthday dinner.The good news -- and the bad news -- was that I found everything to be pretty much the same as it ever was.Let's start with the good news.  The food was still incredible. I have always loved Bombay's use of the dish-warmers at the table, and I've found that I can actually get my dishes prepared to the 10+ spice level I enjoy. The curry entree portions are reasonable -- though the price can be a bit high for some of the vegetarian dishes -- but it's a price I'm willing to pay for the food I enjoy so much.Now, the bad news. The service is still just inattentive enough to prevent one from fully enjoying the food. Here's what I mean. First, when we arrived, our water glasses were filled when we were handed menus, but we didn't see our server again for at least 10 minutes -- when he came to ask if we were ready to order our entrees.  So we didn't have an opportunity to order drinks or appetizers -- and Indian restaurants are one of the few places that I really enjoy ordering both. This isn't a big problem, but for me it is one contributing difference between 4 stars and 5 stars in the service department.We had the same problem when we received our entrees. I had dinner with two other adults, and when our food first came out, we received only one small plate of rice. No problem, it was just enough for each of us to get a couple of spoonfuls to start our dinner.But it was quite some time before we saw our server again so that we could ask for more rice, which left us awkwardly picking at our plates for a bit. We were then brought another small plate of rice (essentially the same amount of rice that is provided to a single person dining alone), which we again quickly demolished among the three of us.  We wouldn't see our server again until it was time to leave, so we never really had enough rice to enjoy our meal.Similarly, when we asked for to-go boxes, we received no additional rice. Almost every other Indian restaurant I've frequented either brings rice in the to-go boxes or asks if we would like more. So among three adults who ordered three different curry entrees (one for the table to share) and one tandoori entree, we only received a two small dishes of rice.In general, the portion sizes are good, though I was a little disappointed with the size of my Tandoori Special Dinner. I typically find the combination dinners to be extremely generous and far more food than one person can eat, which justifies the high price. However, for $17.95 I received a small-ish tandoori chicken leg and thigh, four small (inch and a half long or so) pieces of lamb and chicken kebab, one large shrimp/prawn in the center of the plate (about the size of a small onion ring), and about 6 chunks of chicken tikka. This was served on a small bed of lettuce and was accompanied by a bowl of raita, naan, and the aforementioned rice.It was delicious food, but I won't order that particular entree again. I think the size would be perfect (for the cost) if it came with a curry or vegetable accompaniment. Similarly, the masala tea always ends up being extremely overpriced because the cup is a very small serving and I've never been offered a refill or another cup. I'm not sure if this is a factor of the inattentive service or if the tea is meant to be a no-refills item, but it's a lot to spend for the small cup of tea.One positive note about the service, though. I do prefer the relaxed, leisurely atmosphere of Bombay Palace to that of Sitar. Once you are seated at Bombay Palace, you do feel as though you're allowed to enjoy your dinner and have a good conversation with your dinner companions. At Sitar, though I find the food to be equally good, I always feel that they are trying to turn tables much more quickly, so I have often received the check and to-go boxes within 10 minutes of receiving my entree. This is honestly a bit funny, to me, since Sitar has far more room for diners than Bombay Palace, but I've always felt rushed there.So I do enjoy the relaxed pace of Bombay -- I just wish that the service were more attentive when it comes to ensuring that diners have the rice and drinks they need.We will keep going back, but still with the expectation that the service will be a bit lacking and the food a bit overpriced.",Bombay Palace,6153216140,5 reviews,2014-01-18,"Old Hickory, TN",/biz/bombay-palace-nashville,4.0,239,"Washington, DC",Holly J.
"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"THIS restaurant is the reason why I love Indian food! Every dish I have tried I loved! My absolute favorite is the Chicken Tikka Masala, which is a creamy tomato sauce with big chicken chunks served with basmati rice and fresh Naan. I also love the beef samosas served with brown sauce and green chutney. The chutney is so fresh! I also go to the buffet from time to time. They ALWAYS serve Chicken Tikka Masala and fresh naan in the buffet. I have also tried Butter Chicken which is another great dish and Chicken 65. Try the Chicken 65 if you love really spicy food. Freshly chopped bell peppers and onions with tender, juicy dark meat chicken in a spicy sauce served with basmati rice. I have yet to find an Indian restaurant in Dallas that comes close to being as good as this restaurant. The waiters are very friendly always quick to refill your drinks.

"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"Had a wonderful dinner here last Friday night. I forgot that someone said there is parking behind the restaurant, but we were lucky and snagged a spot up front! An auspicious beginning. When we walked in, there were no booths left, only tables. The manager asked if we'd like a booth and invited us to sit at a table to wait. Shortly after we sat down, a booth became available and we moved. I appreciated being able to do that easily. The food was wonderful and there were enough leftovers for dinner the following night. I had Chicken Makhani (butter chicken) and loved it. Others at the table had Lamb Madras and some kind of chicken kabab that came out bright green on the outside. It was really quite a bright color and spicy. Delicious, too!

"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"So I haven't had Indian food in over a year and that was in Dallas....and I miss it.  No one I know likes Indian food so I have to just dream of delicious buffets. I guess I could go by myself because I'm good with that, but something about buffet and eating by myself seems like I'd turn into a sad chick eating her feelings or something!  However, I may not mind after trying Bombay Palace.I suggested to my lunch ""date"" that we go have Indian food and she suggested Bombay Palace.  It is right on West End so the parking in front seems a bit treacherous since you have to back out in West End traffic when you leave but they also have parking in the back!Inside the place is small and gaudily painted but it smelled like spice.  Mmmm!  We were seated and hit up the buffet as soon as we got our drinks.  Small buffet compared to some places I've been but large on flavor and quality.  They had a chef's special (chicken and peppers), a salad bar, some desserts, and an array of hot foods. My favorite was the chicken tikka masala mainly because the sauce was rich and spicy.  I also enjoyed the chicken tandoori and the chicken madras.  The chicken madras had some good heat without being too hot.  They also had saag and some other vegetable dishes that were all great!  They brought bread to the table for you to sop up all that spicy, delicious sauce.  No shame in my game, I got it all off the plate, trust me.  Too bad I didn't read the reviews for the garlic naan before I came...I'll have to go back and get me some of that because it sounds heavenly.  Lunch buffet is until 2:30 but they were seating people after that and they were eating so I guess it is kind of a loose end time?  They also serve dinner off menu and I hear it is really great.  Must. Find. Dinner.

"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"I had the pleasure of eating at Bombay Palace last night for the first time. We were greeted and seated as soon as we entered the building. The service was polite and professional. I felt as if I was in an upscale dining establishment. We were given a flatbread with four sauces. Bpmbay offeres a few but good Indian beers. We had the Kingfisher and Haywards 5000 that were served and poured in the appropriate glass. We ordered the vegetable pakora which is inexpensive and delicious. Each different vegetable seemed to be battered with the same mix but cooked longer than the other giving it a slightly different texture. The garnish of iceberg lettuce and green pepper did not add to the dish. We ordered the lamb boti kabob masala, lamb pasanda, and the onion and cheese paneer. The entrees were served in neat chaffing dishes which kept them warm throughout dinner. The long grain rice was cooked perfectly. The menu states the lamb is tender and it was very tender. Our requested spiciness level was spot on. The pasanda was sweet and savory and the masala was tangy and creamy. The manage ice-cream tasted fresh and was a bright dessert. The fruit custard was garnished with candied fruit and minced pistachio. The portions were perfect. In summary the prices were surprisingly low for the quality of the food and the service. The manager even came by to check on us and say hello. My only criticism is that the decor could use an little work and the booths rock back and forth if you sit back in them.

"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"Bombay Palace is only the second Indian restaurant I've tried while in Nashville. And I have to say that for the second time in a row, Nashville hits it out of the park for the quality of Indian food I've had thus far.  I've been to Woodlands and was quite enthralled by the amount of spices used. But Woodlands is vegetarian and I like my meat, so going to Bombay Palace up the street was a must.For starters, we had the papadams and an array of 4 dips: Green, red, orange, and brown. Sorry, that's the best I can do identify them. They were alternatively spicy and sweet and hot. There is probably a dip that you will like. The papadams were spicy, a version of which I admittedly have never had at restaurants back home. They were always bland.Before we moved here, I had discovered lamb at Afghan restaurants and fell in love. I now make it a point to have lamb anywhere and everywhere it's offered. I had the lamb pasanda here, and it was heavenly. And spicy. Oh so spicy. That's something else I've learned while in Nashville: ""Mild"" is probably considered ""medium hot"" where I'm from. But I'm also a wimp when it comes to spicy food.The last few Indian places I tried back home were very disappointing -- when I asked for mild, the dishes were completely devoid of spices. At Bombay Palace, I saw the cinnamon, the cumin, the cardamom, etc., in my dishes.The pasanda came with a rice pilaf / biryani, which was my only slight disappointment. I like rice by itself, but I didn't think to ask how this dish was going to be served. And in Indian restaurants, I like rice flavored with the usual spices. But give me the fancy rice which can become a meal on its own, then I think it's an overload of flavors, especially with spicy meat. I loved this dish, but when (and there will be a when) I come back, I will see if I can have this with plain Indian rice.The only suggestion I can make about this place: Lose the suit and (bow?) tie for your servers. Considering my introduction to this fine city was the intense humidity, I felt uncomfortable seeing them in this getup, even though the place is well air-conditioned.

"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"Although my last review of Bombay Palace was almost a year ago, you shouldn't think that I've been away from my beloved Indian restaurant's embrace for so long. Oh no, I probably go 2 - 3 times a month, generally for the lunch buffet, which despite being 7 days per week NEVER lets me down. The quality is always consistently good (which can't always be said for buffets) and the food is super fresh. This is no longer my secret little place, and while it's not unusual to wait for a table at lunchtime, it's always worth it. I leave stuffed and happy each and every time, and the owner always presses extra naan on me as I head out the door.I'm also happy to report that the owner and his staff are still delightful and eager to please - even when the joint is jumping, they always make us feel right at home and give us such personal service. There are definitely more waitstaff on hand during the busy lunch hour, so old concerns about sluggish service are no longer valid at all. At dinner the food can sometimes be a longer wait, but I think this is because they take the time to make the food fresh. The buffet is great for trying various dishes, but if you really want to treat yourself, the dinner is somehow even better because everything is tailored just for you. I would pretty much inject their veggie korma directly into my veins if possible, it's that good.

"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"For some reason the small strip mall next to the Apple Market has proven to be a graveyard to failed restaurants. Yet out of the ashes has arisen Bombay Palace. Hoping that they have better luck than their predecessors, I decided to it make it my next dinner stop. When I first walked in I was befuddled by the mood lighting and elegantly dressed waiters, nevertheless, I pressed on. We started with their vegetarian assortment of vegetable Samosas and vegetable Pakora. Seriously, it was delicious. Trying all the sauces that were on our table, I decided that the mildly spicy green sauce was my favorite, but the sweet brown sauce is definitely worth a try. Our entrees included the Tandoori Chicken and Chicken Tikka Massala and both where fantastic. Accompanied with rice and Naan Bread, the Tandoori Chicken fell of the bone, and the Chicken Tikka Massala, though different than what I'm used to, was equally as tasty. The candlelight cart service and fancy dish set up eventually grew on me, though you can definitely tell that they are a new restaurant. However endearing it was to watch the confusion over what table was getting what, their plates always came out quickly and their wait staff was exceedingly friendly. The owner came to our table many times to make sure that everything was up to par, and brought us a free rice pudding as an after dinner treat.

The booths are a bit small for any size party over two.The food was decent. The Goat Vindaloo was superb. The Tandoori Chicken was not. The chicken was dry and had a harsh 'barbecued' taste.

"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"I've tried probably 2/3 of the Indian joints in Nashville, and I'd describe Bombay Palace as far and away the best. I travel a ton, and I've had Indian everywhere from California to Washington DC to London. I'm pretty familiar with the full spectrum of Indian food, so I can tell you what makes this place stand out to me.1) Service: this usually doesn't top my list when it comes to restaurants, but the manager in particular makes such a wonderful effort. Even though I don't go too often, and there are often multi-month lags between my visits, he still seems to recognize me when I come in. That's pretty incredible.2) Flavors: one problem some Indian places have is that so many of the dishes taste the same. The spectrum from butter chicken to tikka masala to curry to vindaloo should have distinct flavors. At Bombay Palace, it does.3) Meat quality: one shortcut that drives me nuts at some places is serving inferior meat quality. You notice this most with lamb, where you'll get chunks with fat or gristle. Sometimes, you'll get pieces of dark meat chicken in your curry too. I know some people like the latter, but not me. The meat quality has always been very good.I've had excellent luck at the buffet as well as at dinner. The naan is cooked well and is flavorful. The butter chicken at buffet time doesn't taste like it's been sitting out forever, a nice change of pace from other buffets.My favorite dish here, hands-down, is the chicken mango. Ask for it spicy, and you'll get a wonderful sweet-and-spicy flavor that's unique. A couple other ""standard"" Indian dishes that this place does well are the chicken korma and the lamb vindaloo. I ask for the vindaloo extra extra spicy, and while it probably is just that for ordinary people, it's never quite spicy enough for me. The makhani chicken and chicken tikka masala are just OK; for some reason, they lack the richness of flavor that I find at some other Indian restaurants.If you're in the downtown area and craving Indian, I can't think of a better place to tell you to go.

"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"Our fist trip to Bombay Palace was heavenly. That was in the evening and we ordered off the menu... no buffet at night. The food was better than good, the wine selection good, the beers unusual and delightful. The desserts were subtle and memorable. My wife and I had a fabulous time. Then we returned today for a late Sunday lunch and the buffet was the only option. But something was wrong. Very wrong. And it made for a most unpleasant experience. I believe that it's an attitude and organization problem. I'll explain:In the evening, you have a host to greet and seat you. You have a waiter assigned to your table. There's a food runner. The service is attentive, anticipatory, and gracious. And the food is divine. Go in the evening, and you'll love it. But the daytime buffet... yeah, not so much.For whatever reason, there is no waiter assigned to any group of tables, so they all- every one- wander around and ignore the guests. The same folks who were charming in the evening are dismissive, harried and curt. Perhaps they feel that they won't receive the same tips during the buffet that they would receive at the dinner service. The way the staffing of the buffet is arranged, I'm certain that's true.There's a sign on the buffet sneeze guard in 72 pt. type telling diners that naan would be served at table. I couldn't help but be reminded of the shop owner with the ""restrooms for paying customers only!"" signs that one occasionally sees in a struggling convenience store. It wouldn't have been bad if the bread had arrived at any time before we were finished with our meal. Our drink order never arrived. In short, the buffet is quite limited and OK for flavor, with unbelievably bad service. Don't go while the sun shines. But if you can wait until the sun goes down, the place transforms into near perfection. They should really be closed during the day. A lunch place is a different animal from a dinner place... and you'll seldom see a better example than Bombay Palace.

"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"The ecstatic proclamations of ""oh my gawd"" during my meal was enough to rival an all-night love-making session.  The goat saag and lamb chop were buttery, spicy, complex yet alluring, so delicious that it was mind-boggling.  If sexiness is flavor, I found it in these two dishes.  Great service and ambience, too, which rounds off the illuminating experience.  I must say, Bombay Palace transcends Nashville's stereotype and really adds a splash of quirk to the city.  By far the best Indian food I have tasted (which include heavy hitters in San Francisco, Miami, Baltimore, and San Jose).",Bombay Palace,6153216140,249 reviews,2011-07-26,"Miami, FL",/biz/bombay-palace-nashville,5.0,239,"Washington, DC",Peter C.

Then you can find out what you really like, come back for dinner sometime and order just that!. I liked pretty much everything I tried,even though nothing was quite spicy(hot) enough for me. The real ticket is to get some mint chutney(sounds gross right?) It is amazing and has quite a kick! I put this stuff on everything.

"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"I am so glad Bombay Palace is here. I am a huge fan of Indian food and at last, Nashville has a great, not good, but great Indian restaurant. Everything here is just a little more carefully done - the flavors are better, the spices more aromatic, the sauces creamier, and the service is the friendliest anywhere.I love the lunch buffet, but I really like going for dinner because of the special combination dinner for two. It's a great deal that comes with soup , an assortment of tandoori, naan bread, and two curries. It's a good way to feel spoiled on a tight budget.My gauges for Indian restaurants are typically: naan bread, onion chutney, and chicken tikka masala.

"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"We decided to try this place out last night. I was very pleased with the service, all of the servers were very polite and the owner actually walked around and spoke to the customers after their meals. It is a small hole-in-the-wall restaurant in a very nice area of Nashville. The inside is classy, yet relaxed and informal.We spent around $70 incl. tip for dinner. We decided on the combo dinner for two, it runs about $35. We also ordered two kingfisher beers at 7 bucks a piece, I  recommend their Indian wine. I can't remember the name of it but it was smooth, not too sweet and not too dry. A little pricey at $8 a glass, but it complimented the meal wonderfully.The combo came with a starter of pumpkin (?) soup, very flavorful. The main meal included chicken tikka, tandoori chicken, and a ground lamb type of kabob meat. The chicken was great, the lamb was interesting. The taste of the lamb took some getting used to, it was prepared a bit like meatloaf with fresh cilantro and mint leaves.  The tandoori chicken was delish of course. We ordered medium spicy, for the curries and that was pretty hot so beware of ordering too spicy here I was breaking a sweat, and I am definitely a Thai food regular. They veggie curry was great, they used fresh and crunchy ingredients which was greatly appreciated! I like my curry to have some texture. It was a bit cheesy, and a little hard to stomach but if you can handle the cream go for it. We also had some type of lamb curry, the cuts of lamb were spot-on. The meat was very tender and there were no scraps (i.e. fat/gristle). The naan was also delish, a bit crispy but still very buttery and tasty. We also ordered the raita (yogurt with cucumber) very good, but I usually like it a bit runny and theirs was very thick.For desert we ordered kheer, the sweet basmati rice pudding. I really liked the presentation with a little cinamon sprinkled on top along with some sliced almonds and a few raisins. Gorgeous.In all we were very happy with this place, next time we will be trying the lunch buffet, at $8.95 per person it should be a great deal considering the quality of food that is served here!",Bombay Palace,6153216140,98 reviews,2010-08-14,"Lawton, OK",/biz/bombay-palace-nashville,4.0,239,"Washington, DC",Megan T.

"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"This is my 1st Indian restaurant in Nashville and when we arrived on a Friday, it was packed but seating was available. I had the Tandoori chicken and some delicious rice. The bread was fabulous and the evening was well. There were many Indians (please excuse the term if it offends) eating at this place which tells me, it's probably good. All was great! Sitting, talking, laughing w/my boyfriend until he looks at me and says to move to the right. I'm thinking ""excuse me? who are you to tell me to move?"" But he said it again and for the life of me, i moved and then looked to the left and saw a cockroach on the wall! Oh heck no!! I told the waiter who then said ""oh no"" and went to get a towel. He reached over me and I sort of pushed him off of me and told him not to kill it over me. I moved to the other bench and he killed it and grabbed it. Now, i understand things happen so i didnt make a scene. He blamed it on the Chinese restaurant next door and took 25% off my check. I doubt I will come here again.

"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"A fine Indian restaurant in Nashville, with chandelier ambiance.  The imported from India wall paintings of the Taj Mahal, sacred elephants and native scenery help set the authentic tone. Baingan Bhartha roasted eggplant and the Subzi Vindaloo vegetable medley are good dishes among the 20 veggie options.  If you're a carnivore you might try their goat, lamb or shrimp biryani rice.

"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,After reading a review in the Nashville Scene we decided to give them a second shot...as our first visit didn't live up to the hype. I'm sad to say that we will not be going back. After waiting for a considerable amount of time for our entrées...we were completely let down. We ordered the dal which tasted of nothing but heat.  The first sign that we were in for a mediocre meal was the watered down chutney. Their only saving grace was the nan and the assorted vegetable appetizer.  I think we'll stick with Woodlands going forward.,Bombay Palace,6153216140,201 reviews,2009-03-14,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bombay-palace-nashville,2.0,239,"Washington, DC",Peter K.
"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,Bombay Palace is super close to my house and offers probably some of the best Indian dining in the West End area.  The best thing on the menu is the boti kabab masala.  Essentially it is a lamb kabab that is cooked in some funky Indian sauce.  It was super good!  It came with some zucchini that was mushy and not very appetizing.  The people that run the place are really nice and are very accommodating to guests (I came with a disabled friend and they were helpful at getting us just the right spot out of the way from the restaurant traffic).,Bombay Palace,6153216140,292 reviews,2008-09-28,"West Palm Beach, FL",/biz/bombay-palace-nashville,4.0,239,"Washington, DC",Robert K.
"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"I started coming here two years ago, and have never looked back. The spices are superb and yet delicate, the meats are always high quality (never chewy/fatty), everything is made fresh to order and with obvious care. Unlike most restaurants in Nashville, this is a gem that beats out its competition even in most of the other cities I've lived (East/West coast and continental Europe). The caliber of the dining experience extends even to the buffet--naturally a beast to be wary of but here, it is not to be missed. One or two favorites remain pretty constant (chicken tikka masala, a saag) but otherwise the variety is amazing. Every time I go I find a dish I've never tasted before, and both Northern and Southern cuisine are well represented. Vegetables are cooked impeccably (never overdone) and with beautiful naan and the occasional dosa brought to the table, I'm happy as a clam. The service is also something to note--one visit and you'll be recognized, more or less, at all visits following.

"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"We stopped in there on New Year's Day. The place was busy, but the server was very attentive and friendly. We were able to customize our dishes to our heart's content - Veg Jalfarezi (which is a standard in all Indian places) plus a Mushroom Broccoli Karahi (which is much more uncommon). The papad brought out at first was welcome since we were really hungry when we landed up there. The food came prepared quite in keeping with our customizations - not greasy or oily. We appreciated the friendly atmosphere and despite the rush of people coming in, we never got the impression that they were counting the seconds till we would be done and vacate the table.

First the good: the decor is nice, the service is attentive, and I highly recommend the buffet at lunch. My main criticism is the tandoor dishes. It appears they use a tandoori oven and the nann bread is great. The problem was I ordered the tandoori chicken during evening hours after inquiring if it was breast meat and was assured that was the case. Then I was brought a plate with several drum sticks and two small pieces of thigh that appeared to have been left over from the lunch buffet, which is pretty unacceptable from my viewpoint, especially for the cost so I would recommend anyone to pass on that dish and get one of the curries.

"2912 West End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"Visited for the first time last night.  The place was clean and nicely decorated, which was a surprise in that decrepit old strip mall.  Our waiter spoke english, but with a VERY heavy accent, which i don't care about at all, except that i had to ask him to repeat himself 4+ times when he asked for my ID (after I ordered a King Fisher), which apparently made him suspicious that i didn't have an ID (i look young, but am 25), so when he looked at the ID, i had to ask him to repeat himself again 4+ times as he was trying to ask me for my ""date of birth,"" and he started cracking up like he was catching me with a fake?  it was REALLY annoying and if we hadn't been meeting a friend there, I would have left.  Apparently, I made it pretty obvious how annoyed i was with him and I assume he asked the manager to take over for him who served as our waiter for the rest of the night, and was wonderful.Aside from that unpleasant interaction, the rest of our service was fantastic, and the food was wonderful.  I had the lamb saag (lamb with spinach/cream sauce) which was aromatic and well-balanced, and the garlic naan was perfectly grilled and hot.We would definitely be back if they would lower their prices: dinner for the 3 of us, with a beer each ended up being $69 plus tip- a bit high compared to other places in town (Cuisine of India being our routine go-to-indian).",Bombay Palace,6153216140,22 reviews,2008-12-29,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bombay-palace-nashville,4.0,239,"Washington, DC",ALEXIS P.

"2400 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Had the greatest time in Nashville and Caney Fork accentuated it with AWESOME food and stellar service!We had the good fortune (and sense) to eat here twice while we were in town. Both times I had the ""special;"" catfish and ribs. The first time, I chose to have the catfish grilled. It was moist, tasty, a good sized fillet. But it's the RIBS that's the shining star of this place. I don't care what technique they use to make them, DONT @#$%in' CHANGE IT!! They're quite possibly the best ribs I've ever had, ANYWHERE - most certainly in the top 3. I also tried the catfish ""blackened"" the next time we went. While the fish was FAR from blackened, in the traditional sense, it was still very flavorful and equally moist and plentiful. The fifth star of this review is for the service. Both nights we were greeted with smiles and hospitality all around. But ""Sherry,"" on our second trip, was a true gem. She took great patience and care with our questions and requests. Even took an EXCELLENT picture of us at the table. Our drink glasses never got down to half before they were refilled. She was amazing. The ambience is down-home casual and further adds to the welcoming ""vibe"" of the restaurant. Prices are decent - my special for catfish, 1/2 rack of ribs and two sides was $19.99.

"2400 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Can't make reservations and can't call-in to be added to the list....so be patient Average BBQ joint with some pretty cool meat options (elk, gator, etc).  Portions are a little small for the money spent (2 avg people = $50)They do rely on the fried stuff.  Also, the stew with elk, yeah...that should be called Potato chunks with a trace of elk.  Service was somewhere between ok and a little slow.","Caney Fork, River Valley Grille",6157241200,139 reviews,2014-09-01,"Saint Louis, MO",/biz/caney-fork-river-valley-grille-nashville-2,3.0,157,"Washington, DC",Kenny R.

"2400 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"This restaurant is the closest one in walking distance that isn't directly inside the Gaylord Opryland. My party of city-folks were not excited by the name or the outside appearance... or even the taxidermy filled country inside, but boy was I. We waited 45 minutes on the patio, but with a huge country-style porch bench and lots of room, we managed to keep ourselves entertained. Once inside, we were one of two larger parties sat back inside this little 'cabin' of sorts. While it had some neat things inside of it, too, it did shield our view of some of the other happenings in the restaurant, which was unfortunate.We ordered some gator bite appetizers which were totally awesome. This, in addition to these powdered-sugar covered 'corn nuggets.' Fair warning-- these were not corn kernels fried in a savory matter. It was more like cornmeal dough with powdered sugar. I wasn't a fan. You could get 2-3 huge catfish filets (blackened, fried, or grilled) for less than $14. I settled on 2 with some fried okra, and my gosh was it delicious. Everyone in our party loved their food, even if it was way too much for us to eat in one night, and the rooms at the Gaylord Opryland don't have refrigerators. There was also a bluegrass band playing that night with some hardcore knee-slappin', feel good music. I totally dig this place.

"2400 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Stopped here on a whim during a recent cross-country road trip and could not be happier with the decision!  The atmosphere is fun and the random decorations around the restaurant are cute and quirky.  All of the waitstaff were extremely friendly, polite and attentive.  The sweet little powder sugared dough balls that came out before the meal were warm, chewy, and not overly sweet.  We don't even know what they were called!Got fried green tomatoes as an appetizer - just the right amount of breading, well seasoned, and came out steaming hot.  The breading had great flavor but didn't take away from the taste of the tomato.  Wasn't thrilled with the sauce that came with them but it wasn't even necessary to dip them.Dinners:I got the blackened catfish with baked beans and steamed veggies.  Veggies were fresh and portion was large.  Fish was steaming hot and perfectly cooked - nice juicy filet.  The blackening seasoning was nice and spicy without overpowering the fish.  Just got the one piece meal and could hardly finish it; can not even imagine ordering the 2 piece catfish meal!  The baked beans were wonderful - sweet but spicy with lots of onion.My mother got the grilled catfish and half a rack of ribs combo.  The grilled catfish was also deliciously seasoned and cooked to a tee.  I tasted some of her ribs which literally fell right off the bone.  The sauce on them was sticky and sweet - very good.  Her sides were fried okra (not at all slimy like I've previously had) and campfire potatoes which were kind of like hash browns with grilled onions and peppers.  They were a nice addition to the meal.Both meals came with an order of hush puppies.  They were good but could have used just a little more flavor!Overall, a wonderful experience and would definitely recommend this to anyone in the area.","Caney Fork, River Valley Grille",6157241200,139 reviews,2014-04-27,"Norristown, PA",/biz/caney-fork-river-valley-grille-nashville-2,4.0,157,"Washington, DC",Casey S.

We arrived at dinner time and as expected there was a 45 min wait. My collegue and I opted for bar seating to avoid the wait. What we should have done was RUN. We sat down and were eventually greeted by a bartender, if you can call him that. How I would describe him would be a man that made poor life decisions and ended working at this establishment. This he clearly shows through his frat boy approach to customer service or lack there of. I watched him drop a drink on a patron and instead of apologizing he tosses him a rag from behind the bar. Rude.After browsing the menu we wait 30 minutes for him to return to take our order. After he does so he immediately prints us up a bill. I realize our appetizer isn't on the bill so I ask him about it. Honest mistake.  It happens. Only we never get the appetizer instead we watch him walk in circles with it only to then take it back to the kitchen never to be seen again.We eventually receive our food but no utencils. Instead we sit there dumbfounded by this guys utter disregard. We eventually flag down another waitress for utencils. He never returns to get us refills or to check on things. This guy is dispicable. Just when we thought it couldn't get any worse. Guess what? It does! We watch as a man stands and waits 15 mins to make a to go order. Only to be told by our incompetent waiter that he must wait until he takes care of the couple that walked in after him. But, the story gets worst. He over hears a conversation that we are having with the other angry customers and throws our change on the counters. I was at my tipping point and asked to speak with a manager.

The decor is perfect for tourists.  It gives you that country feel with a dash of redneck thrown in.  I love the catfish pond the most.  I had the ribs which turned out to be amazing.  The meat would almost fall off the bone as I picked it up.  Flavoring was spicy sweet with one not overpowering the other. The drinks were made well.  Not too strong or week with just the right mixer added.  I'm no fan of cornbread but loved theirs.  Moist with a slightly crunchy top layer.  During the second visit we came for apps and drinks.  This is when I had the gator tail.  I was reluctant since I used to own a iguana and felt odd eating a reptile.  That all ended with my first bite.  I rationalized it by telling myself that I eat beef but it's not like I'm eating my dog.

"2400 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"We were staying just down from the Caney Fork River Valley Grille (what is it with these long names?!?), and looking for a place to eat. Since we had no idea where to go, we naturally looked online to find somewhere with a decent menu, and somewhere that has boar and elk seemed like it would be interesting. Being in walking distance was a big plus and the gigantic moose outside (which is probably just life-sized) certainly didn't hurt.On the inside, the fun continues. It's like a redneck version of the Rainforest Cafe. Which is to say that there isn't really much to it - no animatronic elephant peeking out from the foliage - or really any foliage, for that matter. Instead, it looked like you were in someone's shack, complete with picnic tables, all manner of stuff and even a fishing hole. Yes, inside. The staff even completes the theme, as they are some of the friendliest you'll find.Is it a touristy place? Sure, but not any more so than any other themed restaurant and you're in a touristy section of town after all, so roll with it. Plus, this isn't quite as in your face as some of those others - see the Aquarium across the way in Opry Mills as just one example. As a bonus, you've got very friendly servers and the food is well-priced for what you get and tasty to boot.

"2400 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Stayed in Nashville unplanned, our Hyatt Place Shuttle Service recommended this place with high regards to the ribs, ""best in town"", he said. Our driver also recommended the catfish on the menu, and I could not be happier that the Southern Surf & Turf special had both on a plate for $18.95. A large portion which can also be shared since you also get two side items with your meal. The Backwoods Tea was really good for $5.95, just wished the drinks were served in mason jars, as our waitress accidentally poured water into my friends sweet ice tea glass, which is a red plastic glass. Budget friendly, great staff as everyone that works there greets you with a smile.

"2400 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I went for the first time to watch the Super Bowl here. It is remarkably tourist oriented which is why I am giving it three stars versus four. Here in Music City I don't think we need the over the top tourist stuff you see in other towns. I had ribs as I do often on Sundays. The portions were more than fair and the prices were moderate. I loved the sauce but I will warn you that it is vinegar based and thin which is what I grew up on with my mom and my grandma. If you are wanting that thick, sugary sauce this is not the place to get ribs. I had a loaded baked potato that was fantastic and just about a meal all by itself. I also had the seasoned green beans and they were fantastic as well. We started off with some gator tail. It was the best I've had outside of Florida. It was fried in a light cornmeal breading with just enough seasoning so that one can still get the full flavor of the gator.

You get cornfritters as an appetizer and I wasn't going to try them because it doesn't sound very good, but they were! They tasted like a fair funnel cake (I picked out the little bits of corn). We also ordered Gator Bites that weren't too bad, but they are a little seasoned. The catfish sandwhich wasn't too shabby.

This included being pleasant, which she was not able to do. I think 2 stars is very generous.

"2400 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Staying closeby and seeing all of the great yelp reviews, I decided to give this place a try.  True to form, the restaurant was pretty kitschy. I called a carry out order and the folks on the line were friendly enough, but apparently carry out orders are processed at the bar. Also pretty normal. I got the catfish appetizers, and the elk sliders with a side of fried okra.  Sadly, the most delicious part of the meal was the fried okra.  The elk sliders wee okay, but in my opinion a little over done.  A couple of things that were turn offs-the dipping sauces were so heavy and mayonnaisey (in a bad way). The second is their ""special catfish"" - it was so gamey and fishy, I took one bite and really didn't want to eat any more of it. For the sake of yelp nation, I kept trying it thinking it would be better, but the fishiness remained.  So an appetizer and sliders was a total of about $22. I really can't recommend that.","Caney Fork, River Valley Grille",6157241200,801 reviews,2012-04-10,"Fairfax, VA",/biz/caney-fork-river-valley-grille-nashville-2,2.0,157,"Washington, DC",Yan W.

"2400 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Went here with a large group and these guys were great!  The place had a great atmosphere all around for both adults and kids....service was great!  They were not pushy or want to rush things as often happens when you have a large group.  Everyone got served in a timely manner as the group filtered in and the food was fantastic!  Our group had quite the variety from the menu and I don't think anyone left unsatisfied!  I personally had the ribs and they were very good as well as the side items of mashed potatoes and coleslaw.  Drinks were kept full, desserts served, and live music to boot!  What more could you ask for!!!  I highly recommend whether you have a large group or not...good food and great service!","Caney Fork, River Valley Grille",6157241200,86 reviews,2010-05-28,"Chattanooga, TN",/biz/caney-fork-river-valley-grille-nashville-2,5.0,157,"Washington, DC",Nick N.
"2400 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"We were attending a conference at Opryland Hotel and decided to give this restaurant a try. Charming atmosphere with the indoor pond and a live bluegrass group. The food was not very good. I had fried catfish and was suspicious of it because it looked like it had been placed in a mold. It didn't have much taste. The campfire potatoes, which sounded delish were quite bland and dry and the Caramelized onions were actually tough. The hush puppies were also dry and rather tasteless. Intrigued by the cheerful atmosphere, I was ready to recommend the place to friends who are coming later in the week, but after tasting the food, I'm going to suggest they look elsewhere.","Caney Fork, River Valley Grille",6157241200,2 reviews,2013-10-26,"Spartanburg, SC",/biz/caney-fork-river-valley-grille-nashville-2,2.0,157,"Washington, DC",Patricia F.

"2400 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Had this on the last night of our vacation.The wait was a bit long, as there aren't many restaurants in this area of Nashville, by the Opry. The mall is closed, under renovation- so no Rainforest Cafe or anything.The atmosphere is fun- with a fish pond, and a live bluegrass band the entire time.The food is mainly fried- fish, ribs, chicken, and steak.We got the fried pickles and crab cakes for appetizers- fried pickles were great but not a big portion. The crab cakes were nothing special- basic fried crab cakes. (I try them everywhere looking for the best- so far, Gaylord's Old Hickory-hands down).We got chicken strips for the kids- steak for all of us- not a lot to rave about- basic steak. Quite dry 7 oz sirloins. We did see our neighbors ribs and wished we'd gotten those- a HUGE portion' they looked amazing.Sides are basic as well- baked potato, mashed potato, beas, broccoli, fries, homestyle fries.The reason for 5 stars is for our server- Christina! OMG-can you say amazing??!!! She was on top of everything and super friendly.

"2400 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"In town for a family reunion, this is the place where we met our first night. On our arrival, our group already were in a private room and had been served their food which everyone seemed quite happy with...this night there were 14 of us. We decided to make reservations to return for Father's Day brunch, with 18 in our party. Again, we had our own private area in a different spot. Service was excellent. Being a Sunday they have a separate brunch menu. We chose instead to go with the catfish which was delicious. Meal starts out with fried 'donut' holes dipped in powdered sugar...arrving at the table warm and melt in your mouth goodness. Had to force ourselves to only eat one, knowing we had a full meal still coming. While we waited for the food I took a couple of the younger family members to check out the restaurant. Numerous fish & game mounts thru out, Decorated in a rustic cabin feel. There is a little fish pond in back with tables surrounding it. Lots of nooks & crannies and interesting things to look at. Back to the table, food was arriving. Our waitress was very attentive to our needs checking back with us often. While we ate there was a local blue grass band playing tunes which was nice background music for our meal. As we left all of the Dads got to pick up a free pack of fish hooks in honor of Father's Day. In regards to the restrooms, there is a b & w picture of a man & a woman holding fishing poles or some sort of camping item on each appropriate door. We did have to look twice at the woman's door to make sure we were in the right place, as the woman in the photo had a hood on & it was a bit hard to tell...a child in our party got it wrong! I would suggest switching the photo to a photo that there is no doubt it is a woman.","Caney Fork, River Valley Grille",6157241200,228 reviews,2009-07-22,"Castro Valley, CA",/biz/caney-fork-river-valley-grille-nashville-2,4.0,157,"Washington, DC",T F.

"250 5th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"As a foodie, I'm always excited to try new places. Bob's did not disappoint!!! Our experience was AMAZING!!! Laura took great care of us and the food was superb. We enjoyed the bacon and smoked salmon as our appetizers. The smoked salmon was so buttery and not too salty. My brother and father raved about how wonderful the bacon was. We also really enjoyed the pickled peppers on the table. Now the main courses were outstanding! We had the veal, lamb chops, crab cakes, and the surf and turf. Have I mentioned how AMAZING our meal was! To top it off, we enjoyed the best chocolate brownie and cake I've ever tasted.  If you've finished this review, it goes without saying, try Bob's!

"250 5th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",4.0,I wish the food was better. The lobster appetizers didn't have enough flavor or acidity to it. The wait staff was also too intrusive and had 4 different people helping us which got confusing and orders didn't come out right. The fish of day (halibut) was overcooked and dry. The cream spinach was too salty and brussels sprouts had too much char on them. The cream corn was very good and tasted fresh and just the right amount of seasoning.

"250 5th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"During a recent business trip to downtown Nashville I had one of the best filets of my life at Bob's. I am (unfortunately!) a carnivorous type and I love a good steak, filet being my favorite. Two gents and I had dinner at Bob's at my urging (it looks beautiful and enticing with its airy but alluringly dim seating and cracking fireplaces, as seen from across the road at the new music convention center). We didn't have reservations so we weren't able to sit in the fireplace-lit room (granted, we are talking the dead of a southern summer here), but we were luckily seated immediately in the bar area. The menu is your typical higher-price point steakhouse: steaks, potatoes, a la carte sides for sharing, salads, seafoods. We split an appetizer of the calamari, and while it was nothing profound (Bob's MIGHT have been a little more imaginative with the dipping option, a straight up marinara), it was tender and tasty and we three polished off the plate. (And I think Bob's serves bread, gratis, but we didn't get any - no biggie however).I wanted a bone-in filet, which isn't a regular menu offering but it was being offered as a special that night. Our server, a friendly and quick gal, noted it was a hefty one-pounder, so I opted for the slightly more conservative boneless 9-oz. filet, med-rare. The two guys also ordered steaks, which all came with perfectly cooked and bursting with fluffiness baked potatoes. And a carrot. We each got a huge, peeled, cooked carrot, tops lopped off, basted in brown-sugary butteriness. It was very pointedly phallic. I don't love cooked carrots or pointedly phallic objects, so I asked both of my dinner fellows if they'd like mine, one who deadpanned, ""no thanks, I have 10 inches of my own."" I plopped the offending root onto the butter plate (really some people may love it, both of the guys did, I just really hate cooked carrots), and enjoyed my filet and spud. My filet was literally cooked to fork-tender perfection, hot juicy red interior with a perfectly seasoned, slightly charred exterior. Absolutely delicious and I shamelessly devoured the entire thick, densely-rich portion.The entire tab before tip was about $137, for 4 beers+3 steak entrees+calamari appetizer. Very worth it and not a bad price for tourist-driven downtown Nashville. I would definitely do a victory lap the next time I'm in Nashville.",Bob’s Steak & Chop House,6157613707,181 reviews,2014-07-16,"Cincinnati, OH",/biz/bobs-steak-and-chop-house-nashville,5.0,58,"Washington, DC",Anna S.

"250 5th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"Since Bob's had only been open a few wks when we dined there,I feel badly giving such a poor review.   We had a great corner booth for six.  Liked the energetic atmosphere.  We were really excited to tour the beautiful new OMNI and try Bob's.   Our waiter was ok....seemed a bit inexperienced....but did the best he could and was very courteous.   The cocktail menu was lacking a proper variety.  Tried to order an off the menu drink, but they didn't have one of the ingredients which was fairly basic.  Settled for their peartini which was good, but too sweet for me.  Wine list was very weak in my opinion.   First bottle we chose they didn't even have.    The basic salad was unbelievably boring & uninspiring.  Might as well have been from a bag of salad.....maybe it was!  Hard to believe a restaurant like this would even consider serving this salad.      Delivery and presentation of food was very outdated and more like something in a much less expensive steak place.  Unbelievable that the server must come to table with a condiment serving dish and ask which items to put on your potato.  My husband and i split a potato....our halves each arrived on the plates upside down.  I had to flip it over, score it, so that server could then dress the potato from the condiment serving dish.   Reminds me of something from the 70's.   Very annoying.  All 6 of us were put off by this.    Filet was ok...not extraordinary.  It should have been extraordinary for the price.  (we dined this weekend at an out of town Flemings, and the filet was fabulous!  No comparison.)    Also, Bob's includes with the steak a huge whole carrot.  You heard right....what an odd choice.   Just too weird.It tasted fine, but again, just a ridiculous presentation.       Not planning a return trip to Bob's.  Too many other excellent choices.

"250 5th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"We got the bone in ribeye, onion rings skillet potatoes and blonde brownie. The ribeye was cooked perfectly, nice crust. Two things I didn't like about the steak was the cresent was very small and it had a little gristle on it. But overall I would give it a 8 out of 10. The onion rings could feed a army. They where very large and you get a lot of them. But they where lacking flavor. The batter was lacking flavor and tasted like it was cooked in the same oil as some sea food. Would not recommend them. The skillet potatoes I got with the gravy on the side, potatoes well done. I also ask for garlic to be added. They where the best skillet potatoes I've ever had at a restaurant. The bread that they bring you is very very messy and hard to cut without annihilating the loaf. It was average bread. The pickles and bell peppers they put at every table were ok. The blonde brownie was amazing. Two brownies with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and a scoop of peanut butter ice cream. Then it had nuts and whip cream and a cherry. They gave it to us for free because it was are anniversary. Scott was are server, he did a great job. He explained the menu very well to us and told us what was popular.

"7 ArcadeNashville, TN 37219",4.5,"I have previously confessed in other sushi reviews to fear eating ""fresh"" fish in a  landlocked state.  And I am a huge fan of hole in the wall joints as they usually offer some of the best food around.  They have to, to get people in the door of such a crappy looking place.  My first experience to the Arcade, the lovely tunnel of awesome culinary delights in downtown Nashville, was my introduction to Jimbo's.  Digest for a second that this place is called Jimbo's Sushi and tell me you'd be jazzed to eat there based on the name.  I had visions of someone in camo fishing guppies out of a fishbowl and putting them over rice.  This, however, was not the case, and to my surprise, this may be the best sushi I've had in Nashville.  First off, this is the small restaurant ever.  Be prepared to get your food to go.  And to wait to go, because come lunchtime, the only time this place is open, the line is out the door and the wait could be an hour.  If you wait, and you're lucky like I was, you may get to sample some of their veggie dumplings.  The sushi tasted fresh (again, landlocked, so here's to hoping!) and despite the crazy busy-ness of the place the service was given with a smile.  Sitting out in the Arcade while enjoying lunch is an experience of its own.  Also, the prices here, and every other place in the Arcade, make this a great lunch stop.  I highly recommend it for the food and the experience.",Jimbo’s Sushi & Korean Food,6152449242,299 reviews,2014-03-11,"Nashville, TN",/biz/jimbos-sushi-and-korean-food-nashville,5.0,23,"Washington, DC",Bridgette C.

"7 ArcadeNashville, TN 37219",4.5,"Ok with all due respect to the other two reviews, I have been all over the U.S. with my job and have eaten sushi in at least 20 states. The best so far btw was in Salt Lake closely followed by San Fran. but i digress. Back to Jimbos,,,Small place, 10 seats, no problem i got there b4 the lunch rush. Cheap, yes very when youre talking two rolls and soup with soda total, $8. However, the miso soup was completely liquid, noting in it, it was the cosistancy of tea and didnt taste much more than that. (Google miso soup real quick and youll see numerous pics of what real miso should look like). The rolls were very small, the pieces were about the diameter of a quarter. yea for bite size but not very filling. Meat was one small sliver down the middle of the roll. Packaged in a small carry out with wasabi and sweet ginger it reminded me that in my travels when i cant find a good sushi shop i can usually find this kind of fare in a grocery store. (Walgreens just off of centinnial park in chicago even had better rolls and it was 20pcs with two shrimp nigiri for 10 bucks! Even tho prepackaged it was better than this).

"4427A Murphy RdNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"I already loved Sylvan Park. Then Cafe Nonna decided to open a pizza and wine bar. I love this neighborhood even more than I already did, and I didn't think that was possible.The restaurant is right next door to Cafe Nonna and is about the same size (small), so once it's popularity grows I'm sure it will be very crowded and hard to get a table at popular hours. The menu is small; appetizers, salads, and pizza. We opted for the oil sampling and cheese dip with bacon, beer, and some Gorgonzola to start. Um wow. The cheese dip was incredible and came with pita bread and carrot sticks for dipping.For entrees I split the Primavera pizza with my friend. It had veggies, goat cheese, and pesto with a tomato sauce base. Incredible. The pizzas were thin to medium crust and tasted SO good! It was a perfect amount, we had 3 slices each and I didn't feel that I over ate. The couple with us had the Goomba, their meat option with pepperoni and sausage. There was happiness all around. They had $5 glasses of sangria and $15 carafes and it was pretty decent. The carafe was enough for about 3 glasses total, so maybe not the best deal but it seemed like it!

"4427A Murphy RdNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"How can you go wrong with piazza and wine? Simple, low key and yummy. Coming here was a total fluke, only found it driving around and searching Yelp as we drove. Started with the beer cheese dip with a glass of Prosecco, which totally helped the after work hunger. I hadn't seen my friend in a while, so we chatted, and the server was attentive but gave us space. BBQ chicken pizza and a bottle of Chianti hit the spot. Asked for extra BBQ sauce to dip my pizza in...different, but very tasty.

"4427A Murphy RdNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"What does one do on an unusually cold late March evening? Travel down the street to the neighborhood pizzeria. This space is small, but cozy. Perfect for a sleety night. I started off with a glass of imported Italian, organic red, valpentena corvina. For only $7.00, this wine is packed full of flavor, without being too dry or tasting cheap.The chicken, pesto (made in house with pine nuts), arugula, mozzarella piadini was a hit, and would make my grandmother proud. (A piadini is wood dried bread pressed with fillings; think of it as a cousin to the panini.)Nonna serves her piadinis with mixed greens and a chianti vinaigrette that is oh so delicious. For $8.00, the entire entree was rather large portion of food.My table mates opted to order different wood fired pizzas. When they arrived, it appeared both pizzas were overloaded with grease. While this is somewhat expected with wood fired foods in general, it seemed a bit excessive, and they both blotted their pizzas with napkins before taking the first bite.For dessert, the menu boasted local gelato for $5.00. Unfortunately, this chocolate chip treat was definitely NOT the traditional Italian gelato. It had the consistency of ""American"" ice cream. When we inquired as to where the ""gelato"" hailed, the server advised he was unaware. He further explained that almost all the foods served are made in house, but the gelato is not one of them.This said, without mention, he simply removed the dessert from the bill. Impressive.I definitely will be back for another round of the piadini, and a delicious glass of red wine to accompany it.",Nonna’s Pizzeria & Wine Bar,6156785232,164 reviews,2013-03-24,"Nashville, TN",/biz/nonnas-pizzeria-and-wine-bar-nashville,4.0,15,"Washington, DC",Martí M.

The third time was less charmed, with an overcharge on our drinks and yellowing mixed greens, hence the four stars here. For appetizers, try the spiced nuts, which have an exotic robust flavor that will have you reaching for more. Also, the olive tapenade is a highlight, a generous portion of served with Cosi-like flat bread and carrot sticks, like all of the dips. Skip the dipping oil, a rather bland oil which deserves a bread with more crumb. The star of the show here of course is the pizza - a crispy thin crust and thoughtfully arranged, generous toppings.

The vibe is awesome and the service great. I did think it was strange to serve carrot sticks + mediocre bread with the dipping oil rather than excellent bread. And the dipping oil itself was a bit bland. This is usually my fave kind of app so I was disappointed. But the pizza made up for it! I wasn't a huge fan of the 3 Graces; I think with their crust I'd prefer a pepperoni or margarita. BEST PART: We sprung for dessert and the tiramisu was the most delicious thing ever.

"4427A Murphy RdNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"Sitting in restaurant number two after trying the Nonna pizza and wine bar to no avail. Hostess was nice enough but didn't set us up to expect greatness. For advertising themselves as a wine bar I guess we expected something a little more upscale. The boxes of wine and beer under the benches didn't exactly scream chic, but hey, we like trying new places so we stayed and started looking through the menu. The wine menu left quite a bit to be desired...short and hardly what you would expect from a wine bar...not very creative, interesting choices at all. The menu was also far from inspiring, but we each decided on something that would make each of us happy...and then we waited...and waited...and waited...and waited. By the time the fourth or fifth country song started playing (in an Italian ""wine bar"") we decided to leave our not-so comfortable plywood bench and head somewhere new...something that we never ever do. We'd love to have reviewed the food here, but sadly never had a server to even order any. We love this style of restaurant when that's what we're expecting. Local taco next door for example is awesome and we know what to expect, partially because it isn't advertising itself as a high-end tequila bar, just tacos. We love all of the new places in sylvan park that are popping up and are so excited for what's to come, but hopefully they will place a higher value on service and atmosphere than Nonna pizza and ""wine bar"" has.",Nonna’s Pizzeria & Wine Bar,6156785232,2 reviews,2015-01-20,"Nashville, TN",/biz/nonnas-pizzeria-and-wine-bar-nashville,1.0,15,"Washington, DC",April ..

Fun atmosphere, but for an establishment that advertises itself as a Pizzaria and ""wine bar"", the wine list is brief and ill conceived.  The prices were fair, but the selections (shy of one nice bottle) seemed like the wine buyer likes to hang out in the box wine section of the wine store.  The pizza I had, the ""Goomba"", was a 10"", thin crust sad affair that was obviously made with a pre packaged frozen crust.  The cheese was not good quality, and there was a fair amount of grease on the pie.

They have $2.50 Craft Drafts, $1.50 Select Domestic Drafts and $5.25 signature martinis ALL DAY LONG! I had a cosmo and the grand lemon drop martini. The lemon drop was the best I've ever had. Seriously, they are so good! And dangerous... It feels like you're just drinking some great lemonade, so be careful how quickly you down them! For dinner, I got the veggie wrap. It has spinach, broccoli and carrots with hummus and pesto mayo. It was honestly just okay. The ingredients are not scattered proportionately so instead of getting evenly mixed flavors in each bite, you will get a big chunk of spinach, followed by a glob of pesto mayo and then a huge carrot. However, judging by the empty plates of my dinner companions, I am definitely willing to go back and try something else. The location is great. I love everything about the Gulch. They have a nice patio, although it was sprinkling so we sat inside. It was a little noisy, which is to be expected with the territory. We were sitting in a corner booth in the back, so it would have been nice to be able to hear everyone a little bit better. I didn't realize I was having to yell, but I had a sore throat the next day.

Which happened to be Bar Louie (it was in the building we were staying in). The Gulch is an AWESOME neighborhood - so I'm somewhat kicking myself for not going to a less chain service restaurant.We got sat almost immediately upon entering, however, it took a good 20 minutes before we were ever acknowledged by server - and this only happened after we waved down a bus boy to ask for our server.Once she finally comes out (I think her name was Halley) she explains to us she had people taking their servers test and she had to over see. My first thought was - who makes people take their servers test on a Friday night at 8:30? Do they expect to have that slow of service? second though - after working as a server I would never blame my lateness on other people I would do everything I could to earn back my tables trust. Free appetizer? maybe a round of drinks - make it work. But sadly, she did not. And it only got worse from there.I ordered a blood orange mule -and it honestly was one of the worst cocktails I've ever tasted. So after one drink I asked her if I could send it back and possibly just have a regular a Moscow mule? Well - at Bar Louie this concept does not exist. She told me ""once the drink hits the table it cannot be taken back"". WHAT kind of a policy is that??? One that should be reevaluated. That's for sure. The food was okay. The buffalo chicken flatbread was decent - I would give more stars for that if the service wasn't so awful. The calamari was bland. The nachos only had like 3 pieces of chicken.

A couple girlfriends and I got there around 6:45 we were given a buzzer, my name was put on the list and we were told it would be around 15 minutes. 30 minutes later I went up there to ask how much longer it would be and on the list it showed that we were skipped over 3 times. 3 TIMES!!  Naturally, we were not happy about this. The hostess then took us to the most secluded table in the restaurant (again not happy). It took around 10minutes for the waitress to even come greet us and take our drink orders. After it took her another 10 minutes for us to get our drinks we ordered an appetizer, that came out in an untimely matter. Then we ordered our entrees. Our waiter, who by the way was definitely on something then proceeded to come back around 15 minutes after weplaced our order and told us she was splitting the checks 4 ways...ok? But where is our food?  We asked how much longer our food would be andshe looked at us as if she was crazy i.e she didn't put the food in. She then came back and said there was a mix up with the tickets so then we really knew she didn't put the food in. It had been close to 2hours we were sitting at the table with no food, when it finally came out it was mediocre at best.  We got the manager involved; he was also on some sort of drug. They ended up taking 50% off our food whenrealistically we shouldn't have had to pay at all. The checks were also completely wrong so she had to go back in and fix them not just once but multiple times. of course the waitress acted as if her mistakes were our fault.

Their flat breads are tasty, I've had the buffalo chicken and the veggie and they were both spot on. They also have a house made hot sauce that is excellent as well. My BF ordered their steak burrito, and it was huge and pretty solid. The cheese sauce on top reminded me of the crap yellow cheese you get at a sporting event, but the salsa and meat was seasoned well. While the food is good, I do feel that it is a bit pricey for what you get. The flat breads run you $12.00 and the main dishes climb steadily in price from there, and I've avoided those items because of it. I sampled some more cocktails, and think the martinis are the way to go. They are pretty stout and tasty!

It actually wasn't busy (the weather was nasty out-raining with potential to ice later on), so we found a spot on some sofas around a large table. This place has a nice atmosphere. More upscale and modern than a typical sports bar, but with plenty of TVs to enjoy the game. Although they have a full bar, I was pleasantly surprised at their large draft beer selection.

"314 11th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"The food was tasty and the service was good but the drinks were weak and the pours were lite. The food and drinks are expensive for what you get. The manager refused to sell me a side order of loaded tots which ticked me off. He was nice enough to offer to sell me a full appetizer portion for 9.75.....I guess the $125 (without tip) that our table of 4 spent wasn't enough to have him figure out a way to make my side of loaded tots happen.

"314 11th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"The ambience was nice, drinks were decent. Food- typical bar fare.The pretzel appetizer was pretty yummy, but there were only 4 pretzel sticks with 3 huge ramekins of dipping sauces. Queso- tasted like rotel, Spicy honey mustard- the best one, and a cinnamon and butter one, which was like dessert-y tasting. Even if you drenched every tiny bit in sauce, you wouldn't make a dent. They need to double the pretzel order to match the sauce ratio. 4 sticks is ridiculous. The chop chop salad was awful. ice berg lettuce and hardly any toppings and little dressing. Had to ask for the missing avocado and bacon. The fried chicken sandwich was decent, but the mac & cheese was completely underwhelming. Stouffers taste better.

"314 11th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I have to say that Bar Louie has one of the best happy hours in town.  I know many others have already pointed this out but it's  1/2 price appetizers (minus the salmon sliders) and great drink specials from 4-7 during the week.  I went there before a show at the symphony and got the adobe shrimp skewers and the beer braised mussels.  My friend and I split them and even though they were both appetizers, it was plenty of food for the both of us.  The mussels had a nice spicy sauce and came with a large piece of French bread.  The bread tasted incredibly fresh and was perfect for dipping .  The shrimp also had a slight kick, with a salad on the side.  Both were very good and you can't beat the price.  Our entire bill that night for two was $20! The server was attentive and polite and I was impressed with how attentive she was.   The only issue I had with Bar Louie was the super loud music.  I couldn't quite understand why the music was blaring to the point we couldn't hear each other across the table without repeating ourselves or talking really loud.  It was early in the night and I would think you might want to crank it up a little later in the evening after everyone has indulged themselves in happy hour.  They did turn it down slightly after our request but it was still annoying loud.  I have been there on warmer days when the front patio doors are open and it doesn't seem to be quite as noticeable.  This may not be an issue for everyone but wanted to mention it since it was the only downfall.Bar Louie is a nice addition to the gulch and I look forward to visiting their patio this spring.",Bar Louie,6154571632,14 reviews,2014-01-31,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bar-louie-nashville,4.0,144,"Washington, DC",Rachel S.
"314 11th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Having seen Bar Louie all across the US I decided to stop in to see what the fuss was about. Very trendy design with a large bar, and few monitors around the bar and coolest of all was the large firepit on the patio. Since it was full I decided to go to the bar.I was immediately greeted by one of 4 bartenders working and and he introduced himself by name and asked mine (which he never forgot). I inquired as to what beers weren't on the list. He proceeded to give a wine type description of three not yet released beers that they had on tap from a Blue Moon visit a few days prior. I ordered one of those and settled in to grab a feel for the place. Once another bartender saw that my drink was getting low he came over and introduced himself also and took my order.Everyone seemed to be having a great time within their own group but it didn't seem like a place to go and meet new people while watching a game. After trying another beer it was time to leave. The top 40 radio from the past 20 years and the bad basketball games on killed the mood. I will probably be back with clients but like a few others on here it doesn't seem like my kind of ""Cheers"". This is not due to any sort of lacking with the service.

"314 11th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"While I'm not sure this will be posted....here goes anyway.  Bar Louie is a terrific place regardless of whether Kurt N  is going to walk down his hall or not.  On a recent trip to Nashville, I stopped in Bar Louie 3 times, no, I don't have a problem, I had two business meetings which took place at BL, and the third time was a visit strictly for pleasure.  Interestingly, before my first meeting, I had the distinct pleasure of Kurt N finding a seat right beside me.  He is a recent transplant to Nashville and a rather retiring figure, so I was quite surprised to read his rather scathing review.  BL hops by anyone's standards, and those bartenders hustle, so I wholeheartedly disagree with his slow service while not in the weeds statement.  Very often the bar is three people deep, so in fact, there may be a bit of a wait.  While I was there I saw customers who were lovely and a goodly amount who were less than lovely, but what was consistent was the barkeeps treatment of all, which was friendly, warm and welcoming, even to those who shortchanged them, and I saw quite a bit of those shenanigans going on.  I NEVER saw any bartender tell a customer that a drink did not taste good, I did see customers asking for recommendations which were given with accurate descriptions of flavor profiles.  If one thinks $7 is alot for a 20oz beer served to you in a glass, then perhaps one should walk back down their hall with a six pack and drink where there is no concern about the service.  As far as someone knowing your name or recognizing your face, I witnessed firsthand, you receiving a warm welcome and being treated in a very friendly manner, which you seemed to be quite uncomfortable with.  Perhaps BL does not meet your high standards, others should def not be put off....it's a fun place. with good music, very friendly bar staff, and a nice clientele.  I overwhelmingly enjoyed myself and wonder what the purpose of writing such a pointed review is especially when you threaten to keep returning.  BL take a good long look at his photo.",Bar Louie,6154571632,1 review,2015-07-03,"Floral Park, NY",/biz/bar-louie-nashville,4.0,144,"Washington, DC",Tara K.

"314 11th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"So, you ever know someone who was generally just okay and then a couple years later he's made a semi-lame attempt to remake himself into something 'cooler'? That's basically what I think about when I think about Bar Louie. They kind of collapsed under their own weight in Chicago-where they started out as a cool, semi-divey, post-college, pre-yuppie kind of place and then they started closing spots down until Bar Louie became the bar at the Holiday Inn near the airport.So when BL opened in Nashville, I figured more of the same and didn't really go out of my way to visit and when my buddy and I were looking to walk off our beer tour I tried to steer us away from it. Finally, with not too many options to just chill out we ended up in front of Bar Louie.The layout pretty much looks exactly like the newer locations I've been too. We were pretty up in the air about what to drink and our bartender was pretty patient with us and gave us a few samples after our first choice was no longer stocked (apparently, a corporate decision.) We ended up with Dead Guy ale and wings, with the wings being all right, probably a little on the bland side.My experience was just ok, but it's probably because I still have the stigma of Bar Louie back up north where it's basically become a not as brightly lit version of Chili's that I can't rate it higher.",Bar Louie,6154571632,1419 reviews,2012-10-23,"Washington, DC",/biz/bar-louie-nashville,3.0,144,"Washington, DC",Ted C.

"314 11th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"This place is okay if you know you want a certain atmosphere coupled with a pretty great location. If you come in knowing that the food isn't great and the drinks aren't the best, you won't be disappointed. I've been a few times, and the real reason is generally the open air atmosphere, the great patio, and the abundance of sports on the televisions around the establishment. Last time I was there, there were a large number of smokers on the patio, which I understand isn't a negative to some people who want that atmosphere (and to be fair, it is a bar before it is a restaurant). I've had a few of the food options- and all were just ""okay.""

"314 11th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,This was the first Bar Louie I have ever been to and this place is pretty good. I like all the TVs on the inside and the decorations. The seating is pretty comfortable too. THe food comes in large portions and should be shared. This place has happy hours from 3-7 and 10 to close. The place can get really packed and service can slow down to a crawl. My only quip is that the service was pretty slow but it was from the staff being busy and not ignoring me so I give them le-way on that. The chicken nachos tasted great and were too much for me to finish. The happy hours are cheap drinks and half off appetizers and flatbreads.

"314 11th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Unacceptable service and intolerable drinks. Myself and some friends were walking around the Gultch area and saw this bar with a fire pit out front. It was cold and we thought, ""this could be fun! Let's go sit by the fire."" We walked in, went to the bar, and asked the bartender, ""do you guys have any specialty whiskey or bourbon drinks?"" She barely looked at us and said, ""nope."" ""Ok,"" I said, ""is that Hudson Rye that I see?"" The bartender pointed to 3 different whiskey bottles before she was able to figure out which one I was pointing at (which was actually the Hudson Rye... So, not that hard to miss) and took our orders of 2 Manhattans and the bartender said she made a good Old Fashion, so, we ordered 2 of those as well. We had to return the Manhattans because they were literally undrinkable. They tasted like she used more vermouth than bourbon. The bartender rolled her eyes as we walked back to the bar to return our drinks and was very, very unpleasant with us. The Old Fashion I ordered tasted like she poured a shot of whiskey into a glass of cherry juice with an orange slice. Had two sips and couldn't take the sweetness and overpowering taste of cherries of it so I didn't drink any more.  We left without finishing our overpriced and disgusting drinks.We walked in laughing and in high spirits and left frustrated and feeling like we had ended the night on a sour note.

I've had good service and wondered why some black patrons reported poor service with the venue, until tonight. We sat at the bar. A white couple was standing behind us. A male waiter/manager/owner came over and asked the white couple if they'd been helped. (Yes, the couple standing behind us.) The couple responded with ""they were here first"". He didn't apologize nor ask us what we needed. A female waitress came up and asked if we'd been served. We hesitated - wondering if we should stay or leave. The male server said - you take them, Ill take them. then he again asked the white couple what they needed. I will say that the female servers were very helpful all night. But his actions did strike us as rude and racial. As a local blogger whose followers are meeting and event planners, I direct great business to my favorite Nashville businesses.  I wouldn't dare recommend a place with such inconsistent treatment of black people.

"314 11th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I'm all for sitting with friends and enjoying a good beverage in a real glass.  And Bar Louie offered just that.  However, I absolutely cannot give this bar more than one star, and that star is questionable.  0.5 stars, I say, and only because of the hefty beer selection.  Let me explain...The server came over and seemed pretty nice.  Dumb, but nice.  He chatted us up, but had no clue what wines were good or what beers were on tap.  He spouted off a few fake beer names - ""Um, Summerdog, and the IPA...Ale"" - give me a break you liar.  I asked if he could just bring me a beer list that included real beer names, and he said they were short on the lists, but he'd go find out.  He never did, despite coming to our table twice.  Not only did he not find the list, but he purposely ignored me and refused to make eye contact so that I couldn't get his attention.  Absolutely unacceptable.I ended up going to the bar inside and grabbing a beer from the bartender, who was pretty quick and helpful.  Thanks to her, the evening didn't completely suck.Additionally, a friend of mine wanted to try a specific wine, to which he brought a sample out for her.  And then when she liked it and ordered the bottle, he explained that they didn't have any bottles left.  Explain THAT one to me????  Here's a hint: don't use a sample bottle.  What kind of classless establishment doesn't offer the customer a sample of the bottle they plan on purchasing?  Am I missing something (besides good service) here?Lastly, and most disgustingly, after all of this hoopla over the wine, the waiter brought my friend a glass that had lipstick on it.  You know what he did?  He laughed.  He wasn't shocked or disgusted, and his apology was a half-hearted ""Oops.""If the service wasn't so unbelievably awful, I still wouldn't go back.  The clientele was full of douchbags and douchebaguettes.  Sorry, Bar Louie.  You are officially my worst bar experience in Nashville, and maybe ever, anywhere.",Bar Louie,6154571632,224 reviews,2012-06-27,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bar-louie-nashville,1.0,144,"Washington, DC",Lyndi S.

The outdoor patio is awesome and offers up some excellent people watching. The menu is full of yummy-sounding upscale bar snacks and they have a good beer selection. But I can't lie, my first experience here was not a great one. Came during happy hour and ordered a draft beer. 14oz glass with 2"" head = not-so-happy hour. Ordered second beer. This one arrived with lipstick on the rim...the hour was most definitely not happy at this point. No problems with 3rd beer, except for a bored server who kept coming over to chat with us about her new house, her job, where she's lived, etc, etc, etc. Food: Soft pretzels were really good, and parm tots were quite tasty as well.Checks came and I was a little annoyed to see that my ""lipstick beer"" had not been comped, but I wasn't necessarily surprised.

"314 11th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Let me start by saying I am typically a BIG fan of Bar Louie. I recently moved to Nashville from Cleveland, OH where there are three Bar Louies. And when I discovered there was one in Nashville, I was instantly excited. In Cleveland, Bar Louie was my ""Cheers"" (where everybody knows your name). Now, I will say the happy hour is great. The food is great (especially the tater-tots which are like little crack nuggets - so addictive), but the service at this location is where my issues are. Now the staff is very friendly (Shout out to Amanda K.), but there needs to be more attentiveness on their part. It took some time for service, and the place was adequately staffed and not very busy during my two visits here. it was a bit difficult to reorder drinks, and get someone's attention to do so. Now I understand that this location has been operating approximately 6 months, which I feel should be enough time to have established a cohesive team. Myself having worked in customer service industries for many years, am very aware when there is a breakdown in service.I would definitely be willing to give a higher rating is the service was more ""with it."" The silver lining here is, even though I wasn't impressed with  service, I will definitely be back. Overall, Bar Louie has a great chillaxing vibe, and is definitely a cool place for happy hour, or to just chill and have some good conversations with some good eats in the Gulch.

I laughed cos obv he had to be joking, seeing as more guys in the building had hats on than didn't, but then he said he was serious. when we asked him why cowboy hats were allowed, he said cos everybody wears them. when I asked about baseball caps, he said yes as long as the bill wasn't straight. lastly, when I asked about beanies, he said ours weren't allowed because they are pom beanies (the ones w the ball on top.) also, zero black people. needless to say we gladly left but it's really weighed on my heart since. a business in Tennessee that by policy doesn't allow NBA games because ""heat fans like to start fights"" and singles out dress code by something as small as a pom beanie vs a regular one...

We ordered a bottle of wine and two appetizers, and we were served promptly. My friend found a bug floating in her first glass of wine. She notified the waitress, who was very apologetic, and took the glass and brought her a new one. I know sometimes, no matter how clean a restaurant, they can't prevent 100% of bugs. However, I was very surprised she  (or the manager) didn't offer her at least a discount, as she lost an entire glass of wine. A few minutes later, we kept seeing the same kind of bug flying around, and had to swat them away. Our appetizers were certainly good, but nothing amazing.

"314 11th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Dined here on a nice fall day and sat outside on the patio.  I was attended by a friendly server who was well versed on the menu items.  They had just introduced a new ""value lunch"" menu.  It had several choices for $7.99 and I think it even included my iced tea which is a bid deal when I am used to paying anywhere from $1.50 to $2.50 for tea or Diet Coke with lunch.  I chose a fried chicken sandwich.  The server suggested going ""buffalo style"" so I did.  It arrived with blue cheese crumbles as well.  I got tater-tots on the side.  What is with tater-tots all of a sudden becoming the popular side? Tasted like the Publix tater tots that I feed my kids.  Definitely, nothing special about them here.  I arrived for an early lunch, 11:45 or so, and it was not crowded so I basically had a dedicated waitress.",Bar Louie,6154571632,77 reviews,2012-09-14,"Brentwood, TN",/biz/bar-louie-nashville,4.0,144,"Washington, DC",Bret D.

But I've been to Bar Louie on several occassions since they opened, and several different times during the day both when they are busy and when the place is empty. I would say 8 out of 10 times service has been horrible. The waiters seem to be bothered from the moment you walk in the door, to the time they take your order. Someone should let many of these employees know that they work in the SERVICE INDUSTRY, which means please put on a happy face while I order my tater tots and beer.I've also had bad experiences when ordering takeout--once they put chicken on a salad for a vegetarian and another time they forgot to put the order in all together.

Unfortunately the restaurant told us they had lost the reservation? I am not sure how a restaurant losses reservations, but they did. We where all left to stand in the door way for over 40 minutes, until somebody decided to say something. The management reacted by buying us all a drink, which was nice. We had to wait over an hour before we where sat at a make shift table, which was three round tables placed together. This was most uncomfortable and inconvenient. The restaurant was obviously under staffed, and for a Saturday evening was a very poor show. The young ladies did everything they could to take care of us, but as they also had many other customers, the evening went from bad to worse! The manager seemed more interested in a pretty blond lady sat over in his bar area. The food order was a mess, incorrect food coming out, food orders wrong, everybody eating at different times. I actually did not eat, as my friends told me how poor the quality of the food was. Such a shame that the management of this new restaurant is so bad, as the place itself looks nice.

"3538 Murfreesboro PikeNashville, TN 37013",5.0,"Hands down the best chinese in the area and possibly my favorite right now in the city.  I get take out when I'm in the area and I am always pleased with what I order. They use fresh ingredients and leave out the parts that are meant to be left out - I can't tell you how many times I've been served parts of the celery, onion and carrot that should have been thrown away at other local chinese places - Chopstick House has no such issues. Their pricing is also very competitive, especially if you order shrimp dishes. Shrimp main courses feature decently sized shrimp - they use small shrimp for fried rice, lo mein and mei fun. I also think they fry their food well - egg rolls aren't soggy with grease, fried chicken dishes are made to order and not pre-fried.I have one gripe: I am not a fan of their spice scale. They do tend towards the bland side of spicy, which means you should request more spice if you're into it. I don't blame them, I blame Nashville for that one.

"160 Belle Forest CirNashville, TN 37221",4.0,"I went to Crumb de la Crumb today for lunch with a friend. I got the vanilla bean lemonade. It's quite unique! They brought out a few ritz crackers and a small cheese and pecan ball covered with jam for an appetizer. It was really good. I ordered the ultimate grilled cheese (bacon and pimento cheese on whole grain bread) and the lemon artichoke soup for my entree. I'm really picky about bacon. I like it to be really crispy. I told the server this and debated on whether or not I should just order the plain pimento cheese sandwich without bacon so I could avoid disappointment. The server mentioned that the bacon is pre-cooked but that they could ""nuke"" it to make it crispy. When my meal came out, the bacon was floppy... The server asked if it was crispy enough as I was picking it off the sandwich. I told her it wasn't, and she offered to have them ""nuke"" it again, but I told her I didn't want to have to wait to eat my meal. She said, ""Ok. Let me know if you change your mind. You're paying for the bacon."" Not really sure why she couldn't just charge me for the regular pimento cheese sandwich since that's what I ended up eating, but I wasn't going to argue over a couple dollars. The pimento cheese is homemade, and it is divine! The lemon artichoke soup was so-so. I saw several other things on the menu I wanted to try and the atmosphere is nice, so I am going to go back again.

"160 Belle Forest CirNashville, TN 37221",4.0,"I can't overstate how much I love Crumb De La Crumb's cafe. This is my go-to, absolute favorite lunch spot in all of Tennessee. I live in Mt Juliet but travel the 30 miles to Bellevue to indulge in the delightful fare. My personal favorite? Charleston She Crab soup and chicken salad on a croissant. Heaven I tell you, heaven! If you haven't checked this place out yet, you're seriously missing out. Go now!!Reason for an imperfect review: Two things.1. The check out process is usually very time consuming. I normally wait 5-10 minutes in line before being able to pay my bill and leave. You have to go up front and pay which is fine but usually, the patrons in line are slowly picking out different desserts to purchase at the same time. There's only one cashier, usually the same lady. I don't know her name but she always seems down or unhappy. Which is always frustrating because the servers are usually very sweet and helpful. 2. I wrote a review several years ago on their old Yelp name ""The Cottage Cafe"", but they have since changed their official name to Crumb De La Crumb to keep in sync with the dessert side of their business. Maybe I've always had bad luck with the desserts but I've tried many of the bars and cupcakes and always found a serious fault with them. For instance, a red velvet cupcake I had was extremely dry (like it had been baked a few days before) and the icing wasn't as sweet as you'd hope for a cream cheese icing.

"160 Belle Forest CirNashville, TN 37221",4.0,"Crumb De La Crumb was average at best. They bring out a pimento cheese with strawberry jam to be served with ritz crackers. (I honestly only associate Ritz with toddlers and cheese cubes at the park), I order a cappuccino that was actually a latte, and the shots had died (so they were bitter and pungent) it wasn't a smooth drink the way a cappuccino should be. I ordered one of the French toasts with goat cheese and jam. It sounded decadent. It was the least impressive thing I ordered. The toast was soggy as if the griddle wasn't hot enough and there was a gross amount of cheese and jelly. The jam also tasted like it came straight out of a smuckers jar.

The chicken on the salad was beautifully seasoned - it was tender and flavorful, but the flavor wasn't so strong that it distracts you from the other flavors in the salad.  And whatever they do to make that cranberry-orange vinaigrette... it's heavenly. --The vanilla lemonade was refreshing, and not overly sweet.  A perfect drink for spring/summer.Overall, I was very pleased with my lunch, and with the friendly owners as well - Jason and his wife Lorrie.  While waiting on my order (which didn't take long), Jason explained how everything at Crumb de la Crumb is made by hand... from the frosting to the salad dressings to the lemonade.  My only regret is not trying any of the baked goods that were calling my name from within the display case.  I'm currently watching what I eat because of an upcoming trip to the beach, but you better believe I'll be back for lunch again soon, and will have to try some of the desserts then... hopefully it will be on one of the days they have live music in the dining room!",Crumb de la Crumb,6156732223,14 reviews,2014-05-05,"Chattanooga, TN",/biz/crumb-de-la-crumb-nashville,5.0,44,"Washington, DC",Emily P.

The bar staff were great. The server was very nice. The menu is clear about what comes in each dish and states that they're willing to accommodate any changes you wish to make. It was really nice. Most of our table ordered the pizza because it sounded really good. I had that as well and added chicken. I'm not sure what I expected from a gluten free pizza, but it was very good and the chicken was grilled wonderfully. The decor was classy and clean.

My $5 plate of seasonal veggies consisted of a minuscule amount of raw kale. My Celiac sister liked the fried chicken and appreciated that she didn't have to ask if anything was GF. My moms salmon was ok. The tomato soup tastes like marinara sauce. The wait staff was kind but over attentive. People were constantly hovering at our table asking how we liked things and if we thought it was good. When we brought the salad issue to the waitress' attention she called another woman over but never introduced her. Maybe the owner or manager? She apologized profusely and said she would take care of it. Apparently that meant bringing us cake. They also said the cake was for my moms birthday. Unfortunately, that was dry and the buttercream frosting just tasted like butter. We did not have the heart to say everything was bad.

"1100 Fatherland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"100% gluten free --- the entire menu! Sign up the troupe of characters that includes the Celiac and let's schedule a night out on the town!The space:The space while small, is quite nice, quite open concept, and had it not been the dead of winter then I think we would have asked to sit outside on their deck which was cordoned off from the restaurant by glass garage doors. I really enjoyed the cute little reclaimed wooden frames scattered throughout with glass inside and then hand written words on the glass (that can be changed all the time). There were also two old either barn doors or sliding wooden doors at the back of the restaurant with motivational phrases written in chalk across the doors.Sign me up for some positivity.The food:Appetizer: The spinach and artichoke dip nachos. Concept lost upon you? That's okay. Just think about it for a second. Normally, when you get spinach and artichoke dip, you also get bread or chips to dip into it. Well, Matter of Taste has taken care of that for you and drizzled the glorious cheesy mixture atop the chips for you. Main courses:The risotto of the day: scallops, steak (filet mignon), and creamy and rich garlic and cheese risotto. Scallops were cooked to perfection, and were not chewy and overcooked - a common mistake in this beautiful yet landlocked state. The steak cooked medium-rare to perfection and savory on the way down the gullet.The cuban sandwich: chocked full of meat and the right amount of mustard and pickle. Just try and stop yourself from double fisting each half. Served with salted/peppered potato chips (I didn't have the side of potato chips since I had nachos to start --- chip overload on the part of our ordering).The build your own margherita pizza with currant tomato sauce, onions, and cheese. The little dude is 50/50 when we add meat so we just got it plain old margherita pizza. I tasted half a piece and the crust was quite good for GF pizza crust and the currants added a nice flavor to the sauce. Plus, it was a sizable offering of pizza -- I'd got with between 8 - 10"" as my guess. The menu might have said but I have forgotten. Dessert: a GF blondie served with strawberries, blueberries, and homemade whipped cream. Okay, so the first one that came out to us had some aluminum foil still baked into it. Oops! Bit of a snafu. We sent it back. The second was sans aluminum foil, and the one bite I had was delicious and tasted like a traditional blondie.

The filet and risotto have always been great. The service is spectacular and they are never annoyed if you want to modify what you're ordering.

"1100 Fatherland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I was really looking forward to trying this place. I was so excited when it opened, but it was a bit of a letdown. I've been here a few times. Every time, I waited for my food forever. When it got to the table, it looked great, but their food just isn't fantastic. I get that it's gluten free - I'm celiac, so believe me, I know the taste difference. But these guys really dropped the ball. I've been to so many other restaurants that can modify their dishes and have them taste amazing. These guys can't even get it right, and they're supposed to specialize in it! The french bread was absolutely terrible. Too salty, hard as a rock on the outside, and far too airy on the inside. I've had better gluten free rolls at other restaurants! If you can't make edible gluten free french bread, find something else to put on the menu! I can't remember what I've had for actual meals, I just know nothing was too exciting. I've tried both their chocolate brownie, as well as their strawberry shortcake, as well as another desert. All were letdowns. Such a bummer, because I really feel like they could be great. A lot of potential here, but they need to find someone that knows how to cook gluten free, and just get some new recipes together. It really seems like someone is just experimenting with food, which is great, but do it on your own time. I spent years perfecting certain recipes, and even my worst efforts were better than some of their dishes. I'll probably keep going back every few months, just to see if they get any better.

"1100 Fatherland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Rather disappointing! We were so excited to try a completely gluten free restaurant, but we were sorely disappointed. The service was mediocre. The servers were friendly enough but once our food arrived we barely saw our server again. We ordered biscuits and preserves to start. The biscuits had a grainy texture, but we're okay otherwise. My wife ordered pancakes and bacon. The gritty texture was even more pronounced in the pancakes. They were dry and not flavorful. There were only 2 slices of bacon, one of which was almost all fat. I ordered the southwestern omelet. It was supposed to have salsa, but there was none. No one asked us how the food was so I didn't get a chance to ask for some once I realized it was missing. Perhaps the worst part was the avocado with the omelet. It was too hard and rubbery to stick a fork into, let alone eat. That omelet never should have left the kitchen with avocado like that. I would have been much more understanding if they'd just told me they didn't have avocado. But to put that on a plate and try to call it food was laughable. Then, with our food barely touched, the server offered us a box and when we declined she simply brought the check. It was clear we didn't like our food but they didn't bother to ask us why. Super cute decor, super great idea, very poorly done. And I make gluten free baked goods at home frequently, so it isn't like it was just the gluten fee part that was the problem!  Gluten free can taste delicious if done right, but this wasn't.",A Matter of Taste Eatery,6158668144,12 reviews,2015-07-26,"Saint Louis, MO",/biz/a-matter-of-taste-eatery-nashville,2.0,49,"Washington, DC",Theresa R.

"1100 Fatherland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"We have been here 4 times to eat inside and then had take out the last 2 times. They seem to get progressively worse. At first the nachos and bruschetta were great. The second time the fried chicken was not so great. Third time, the tomato basil soup was tasteless and the chicken salad sandwich was horrendous. you need to take some lessons from the sandwich bread used at Mitchells as well as giving a better portion of chicken salad instead of 3 big leaves of lettuce because you are pretty pricey. Tonight on October 10th, the squash and ginger soup was so thick that it looked like southern gravy and had chunks of uncooked squash in it. the Caesar salad I ordered had no croutons and I asked for an extra cheese biscuit and they gave me two slices of their hard as a rock sandwich bread. Case in point, I could have gone anywhere in order to order a Caesar without croutons, I love you little cheese biscuits substituting sandwich bread is ridiculous. So I call and tell them after I get home and realized how messed up my order is that I didn't get my cheese biscuits and there are no croutons on my Caesar salad as well as the texture of the soup. I would not even be writing this horrible review if the customer service was up to par. the girl who answer the phone could have cared less and told me to come back and get something else and that they were out of the cheese biscuits and that's why I got the sandwich bread. I said I wasn't driving all the way back but could I get a credit. she told me that was $0.50 for the cheese biscuit and barely anything for the croutons so I guess basically a $0.75 credit. you guys need to learn customer service that should have been offered another meal because this was not what I ordered not because of the price. Not to mention the takeout order before this had to be repeated 6 times because the girl could not get it correct.

"1100 Fatherland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I was really looking forward to checking this place out after looking at their menu online. Went with my family Friday night for my wife's birthday (she's GF). We were seated at a table immediately behind a couple. There was very little space between these two tables, and I could barely squeeze in without hitting the guy. (There were other tables that were open and well-spaced).Started with the hummus appetizer, knowing the four-year old would eat it. I guess it was a black bean hummus, though the menu just said ""hummus"". Not what any of us were expecting. And it was grainy. Not particularly good. They did bring some extra chips for it, though.My wife had ordered a salad with green goddess dressing. She took a bite with the dressing, and went wide-eyed. She asked me to taste it, because she thought it was dominated by raw garlic. So I put a bit to my tongue, and my entire mouth buzzed and burned. It was the exact sensation of holding a 9-volt battery to one's tongue. Raw garlic? Horseradish? Bad yogurt? No idea. Waitress said she'd bring a different dressing. No other acknowledgement when she came back. My wife had to ask if she or the kitchen tasted it, and she said she did, agreed something was wrong, and said the chef was working to fix it (whatever that meant). No apology, no explanation, nothing from the kitchen.For entrees, my wife ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and mashed potatoes. This was by far the best - and only good thing - any of us ordered. It was delicious, though the pesto (?) on it was unnecessary. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and the breading was very light. It would be wonderful for fried catfish.I ordered the special, prime rib (medium) with marscapone mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables. I don't know what was set before me, but it sure as hell wasn't prime rib, and it was gray throughout. No pink or red anywhere. Seriously, I have no idea what kind of steak that was. My mashed potatoes, and my wife's, were cold. We ordered the pizza for the four-year old, who loves pizza. She didn't care for it. None of us did. It was completely soggy except for the very edge of the crust. Hell, I make gluten-free pizza at home, Dominos can make a non-soggy gluten-free pizza, I don't know why this place can't. They should probably throw a plain pizza skin in the oven for a few minutes to set it and make it firm and crispy, then remove it and dress it out, then return it to the oven. I think the pizza would support the marinara much better if they did this.Very disappointing meal and service. Not quite sure what they're going for here. Casual? Dressy or semi-dressy? Hip? Well, there is a large tv over the bar that was on the entire time, with some HGTV-type show on the whole time.

"1100 Fatherland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"This place had so much promise! The idea that you could go to a restaurant and not have to filter 90% of the menu because of gluten.  The location was convenient and atmosphere was clean and bright. I've gone twice, once for brunch and once for dinner.  Service the first time was lacking, and I decided to give this place another shot because it had just opened at this location.  Went for a second time for dinner last Saturday, and nope, no improvements.  It wasn't clear why service was so bad, as there were 4 people working the front of the house, and the small restaurant was only half full.  We had the same server as the first time.  Sat for 10 minutes without being greeted by our server, or without water.  Friend's wine sat on the bar for almost 10 minutes before we flagged down another server to deliver it to our table. Our server seemed to divert her eyes whenever someone from our party tried to flag her down or spent most of our meal facing the wall behind the bar. We eventually had to have multiple people at our table wave their hands frantically in the air to get someone's attention.  I found something strange floating in my drink... rather than deal with getting the server's attention, I didn't finish it. Food sat in the window for a few minutes before it was delivered to our table. I ordered the ""special"" prime rib dinner.  The meat was not cut evenly and grilled after it was cut.  So half of it was well done and the other half was medium.  It wasn't served with the veggies that was advertised by the server.  (Try to flag down server again..)  Veggies came later after requesting them.  To top it off, I was mischarged for my entree.  More time elapsed to get our server's attention to fix the bill.  The bill was adjusted without hassle once it was brought to their attention. Too bad, lost my business.  Recently went gluten free and live nearby.  I would have loved to have a regular dinner spot.",A Matter of Taste Eatery,6158668144,3 reviews,2015-01-12,"Nashville, TN",/biz/a-matter-of-taste-eatery-nashville,2.0,49,"Washington, DC",Jocelyn S.

Yes it was always a decent coffee place and good for coffee and bagel and smear/bagel sandwich. We have gone on every day of the week including weekends. We left after the flood and recently came back and came to Star bagel to get our lazy early Sat Am coffee and bagel. OMGosh...the place blew up. I did not count how many deep were in the line. I think I remember counting 11 but stopped. I looked at my SO and thought. How the heck did this place become so crazy busy. Then I thought and voiced out loud. Are we too old for this place?  We were def not the oldest, but it is a bit hipster/athletic/college/high school vibe going. We are non of those. Just 40+ people that kept a house in the city because the house on the River was flooded. Don't get me started. Remember the old faces from way back when, there were 2 of them, still as sweet and a few younger versions. All pretty speedy and nice and still a great place, but this time, there is a different vibe. A WE LOVE NASHVILLE vibe. We have seen this in a lot of places, but our little Star Bagel also has this. We still had a few tables to choose from and people are very nice. Reminded me of a coffee shop in DC or Philly. Nice people who just want a coffee and pastry. I am just incredulous how after this place has been around so long, how crazy crowded it finally has become. Have to add, last time I was here, was 2010, so 5 years later...Great place, great coffee, friendly FAST service and now with a new twist of lots people watching opps.

I usually order online (a great feature, which wins a star in my heart) and just pick it up.  However, they seem to get those delayed, and sometimes don't get the order, so if you order online, make sure you call ahead to see if they got the order.  I don't think too many people do it, so they rarely check I believe.  The bagels are excellent, and the cream cheese is pretty good.  A good amount of choice for bagels and cream cheese.  I'm not a culinary expert when it comes to telling you if it was made fresh or a year ago in some warehouse, but it tasted very good to me.   They have a pizza on a bagel option, which most likely isn't very healthy, but something I can definitely eat, enjoy, and then omit on the fitness pal account.  Essentially some cheese, and toppings on a bagel.   The veggie wrap is excellent, I've gotten the hummus and veggie one and it's a wonderful wrap.  The best thing about it is the customize able aspect of it, so you can choose from a bunch of stuff, rather than the standard affair at cafe's where you have to all but choose from what they serve.  I haven't tried out their drinks, but some of them do seem appealing.  The staff is friendly for sure.  Just be warned that this place gets very busy in the morning, so you may have to set apart some time to get your food.",Star Bagel Cafe,6152927993,50 reviews,2015-03-14,"Nashville, TN",/biz/star-bagel-cafe-nashville,5.0,120,"Washington, DC",Alvin P.

"4504 Murphy RdNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"Highlight of 2015 thus far for me was discovering Star Bagels' Chicken Salad on Cranberry bread. Made with antibiotic free chicken and piled high on top of fresh, and slightly chewy cranberry packed sliced bread... deeeelish. I love the addition of halved grapes as the add that extra touch of sweetness. Paired with a bag of chips, this makes the perfect lunch for right under $7.

"4504 Murphy RdNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"This is my go-to bagel breakfast spot for Sylvan Park.  I'm a fan of the food but really like the people and atmosphere.Food:  I order a toasted blueberry bagel with butter and strawberry cream-cheese.  I usually order 2 with the intention of saving one for later.  Then, I eat both and fall into a food coma until lunch.  My only complaint is that Star Bagel can be inconsistent with your order.  I pick up a lot and would recommend checking your order before you leave.  Sometimes, they forget to toast the bagel or forget the cream-cheese.  Service:  there's usually 2 people taking orders.  The line can be fairly long on a nice weekend.  It's hard to justify waiting in line for 10 or 20 minutes since I'm only grabbing bagels, but I go early (8 or 9am) and avoid the rush.  There is this one little lady who always takes my order.  She is really friendly and sometimes hilarious.  I find most of the workers there really nice.  I go fairly frequently, and they greet me like a regular.Atmosphere:  love the place.  It's local Nashville, low-key and charming.  On a nice day, you can eat breakfast or grab some coffee and sit on the deck.",Star Bagel Cafe,6152927993,119 reviews,2014-06-07,"New Orleans, LA",/biz/star-bagel-cafe-nashville,4.0,120,"Washington, DC",Chris B.

Love the bagels, bagel sandwiches, smoothies, coffee drinks, etc. The coffee is good, it seems strong to me but don't take my word for it, I am no coffee expert. Everything tastes so fresh! My favorite sandwich is the asiago turkey or one of the specials with turkey, pesto, and avocado. YUM, please add this to the daily menu! I have also had great service in all of my experiences here.

"4504 Murphy RdNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"I really enjoy Star Bagel (I clearly like it since I am apparently the check-in duchess, need to be check-in duchess at a gym now...). The parking situation is iffy but you can almost always find a spot. The bagels are pretty good, but a bit chewy in my professional bagel eating opinion. I come here for two reasons: 1. Best bagel place within five minutes of my house (if I've got time to kill I would choose to drive to Bagel Face in East Nashville for a really premier bagel, but usually Star Bagel suffices).2. They have smoked salmon cream cheese with big pieces of smoked salmon in it! It combines the best parts of a bagel and lox in one tasty whipped spread. The cream cheese is so good I have bought it on its own before without purchasing any bagels.. keep your judgments to yourself. It's that good, take my word for it. They have really good fruit tea and green tea and mixing them together makes an excellent libation to accompany my bagel with smoked salmon spread. Star Bagel is an all around awesome place with a good selection of bagels, pastries, and coffee, and a much better choice than a lot of the nearby chain bagel shops. 4 stars for Star Bagel.",Star Bagel Cafe,6152927993,124 reviews,2013-11-19,"Nashville, TN",/biz/star-bagel-cafe-nashville,4.0,120,"Washington, DC",Chelsea J.

"4504 Murphy RdNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"The only thing in this world that motivates me to wake up at 6:00am on a Sunday morning is Star Bagel. I love Star Bagel. Who doesn't love a zesty pizza bagel smothered with fresh homemade cheese? Who doesn't love a  Smoked Turkey on Jalapeño Cheddar bread? The possibilities are endless and the food always fresh. The funny thing is I am not sure why I love Star Bagel so much. Yes, the food is delicious and their pre-made salads (the Thai Chicken is my favorite) is probably one of the best salads you can find in Nashville, but there is just something special about the ambiance that adds to the whole experience. Located in Sylvan Park, it is a small homey place that has housed the same staff for years. Their menu is fresh and the location is very relaxing. Be warned, however, that a lot of other people love Star Bagel as well and the place can be super packed during the breakfast hours and you may be out of a place to sit if you arrive at peak times.  The good news is the turn around is quite fast and I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for something to open up.

The bread they serve their hot deli sandwiches on is also delicious - they call it a muffaleta bun, and it is freshly made and thick but light with a nice chewy texture, which really makes the roast beef, cheddar, onion and horseradish sandwich (my favorite).

"4504 Murphy RdNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"Had been meaning to try Star Bagel for almost a year. Its only a few blocks away from my work on Murphy Rd., so its pretty amazing that I hadn't eaten there until today. I went in and the first thing I saw was  the daily special which was a roasted turkey on Ciabatta with pesto. They only make the Ciabatta bread on Fridays, that being said, I am so glad I ended up going in on a Friday. The Ciabatta was ridiculously fresh and a great texture.  The only downside was they won't do the half a sandwich combo with the Ciabatta special. However, it wasn't really a downside because as the woman said when I ordered ""You will want the whole thing!"" And she was absolutely right I did want the whole thing. I also ordered a cup of turkey chili. It was perfect for me, but beware I don't like super spicy chili so while I loved it I have a feeling people looking for a spicier chili might be disappointed. The wait wasn't too bad but I got there a little early for the lunch crowd, right at 11:00. I read on the bag that you can order online and if you are going at a more popular time it might be a good idea to order online. When I'm ordering lunch from work ordering online is always appreciated especially if we are doing a big group order.

"4504 Murphy RdNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"I have a bunch of friends in the Sylvan Park area that have always recommended Star Bagel to me. I am a bagel fanatic and enjoy the irresistible combination of bagel and cream cheese, paired with a fantastic cup of coffee.  That being said, I had this image in my mind of Star Bagel being this small quaint little shop with a line out the door and no seating.I was pleasantly surprised by the space of the facility.  There is a great patio outside and a bunch of tables inside.  The atmosphere is nothing to rave about, but for some reason it reminds me fondly of the typical sitcom cafe. I imagine Seinfeld walking in, ordering a bagel and a cup of coffee, and sitting down at just a typical mediocre cafe, complaining about life and its mediocrity. Okay, so maybe not Seinfeld, but if there were a Nashville sitcom, their morning hangout would be this cafe.  There's really nothing in particular special about the ambiance, and yet that is exactly what makes it particularly special.Atmosphere aside, let's move on to the goodies.  The bagels.  Oh, the bagels. They have every variety known to mankind and they are all delicious. Get them toasted, obviously.  I ordered the cinnamon raisin swirl with honey walnut raisin cream cheese. Oh, goodness. How I love their cream cheese. It was so smooth, slightly sweet, and packed with yummy goodies like walnuts and raisins.  I was at first turned off by the fact that they had spread the cream cheese on my bagel for me, but I think it is only because they have perfected the exact ratio of cream cheese to bagel that equals blissful happiness. Don't worry about them skimping on cream cheese, they definitely put on enough. They also had a variety of other baked goods, but I couldn't very well try Star Bagel Cafe and not eat a bagel. They appear to also have some sandwiches--I have yet to try them.Also, I was impressed at how good the coffee was for a place primarily known for their bagels.  They had a wide selection of different brews, and I was impressed even by their house blend. They had a hazelnut brew that I wanted to try but they were all out of it by the time I got there.Great place for breakfast or a cup of coffee. Gets pretty busy in the morning though.

"4504 Murphy RdNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"Star bagel has everything a great place should.Parking is a nightmare due to it's popularity, so I would suggest the stinky alley, up on a curb, near some trash cans,   The cleaners next door tow, as well as the Sylvan Park Cafe, and the nearby rental property is to die for.  Had a buddy who lived there once, and I was always proud he didn't die from gorging himself living between Star Bagel and McCabe's Pub.  The duplex was small and crappy, however.Bitchy women in work out clothes that throw stares like Bozo slings pie.  They alone are worth the higher fare.  They even make my wife snicker, especially on a sleepy Saturday morning.  I'm just glad someone is able to be fashionable, yet unkept.Orders are spoken thru a microphone which is truly a lost art.  Sit down, wait to hear your muffled order, try to read the paper, and check out all the black pants, North Face jackets, and running shoes.  Dont' get knocked over by zealous patrons and hipsters.  A Mulitasker's dream.  Truly.  Dogs will be tied up outside, or brought inside if your special and can pull it off.  My wife is all about the dogs.  If you will go to Star Bagel on a regular basis, you probably don't even have to get a dog, but most people should get their own dog to tie up eventually.   Especially if you like dogs AND stars AND bagels. I would highly recommend any of the breakfast bagels.  They are all delicious.  If you need a guilty pleasure, get a pizza bagel.  When I used to hustle loans for the bank on West End, a garlicy pizza bagel was the perfect way to start my crappy day.  It is unbelievable!  The bank was sold, but the pizza bagel has remained!My wife is fond of the everything bagel, and I'm a honey wheat guy.  They don't need much to be good and consistent.   We are also mocha fans, which can be hit or miss, mostly hit.

"4504 Murphy RdNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"Let me start off by saying that I LOVE the bagels here. I have been coming at least once a month for years now. So why 3 stars? Over the course of my visits I have experienced several things that make me cringe. 1) The owner is not very nice. I believe I read another review about a snarky email comment and the same thing has happened to me. I have also had a few things happen while visiting where the owner was beyond snarky to either me or another customer. I have also been scoffed at by an employee when I sent my bagel back because it was not made how I requested (I wanted the cream cheese spread on both sides of my To Go bagel rather than one and then closed). 2) The parking is awful as has been stated. I wish they would just move locations. 3) HYGIENE habits! There is a blonde woman who works there who is always there. She is really really nice and I like her a lot, BUT she wears her gloves non-stop. I've seen her smoke a cigarette outside with the gloves, take people's money, and then reach for a pastry in the same set of gloves. I have left before rather than risk having her touch my food with those gloves. One time I happened upon Star Bagel when it was practically empty (amazing!), but as I waited for my bagel a bucket full of soapy water was taken from the floor around the counter and set ON the counter where they set the food. It sat for 2-3 minutes before someone made it around the counter to get it. The counter was not wiped and my bagel was placed there.

"4504 Murphy RdNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"Because I'm new in town (and only here temporarily), I'm dining solo a lot. And I place a high premium on places where I can get a decent meal, check out the local scene without seeming too much like a wall flower, and not feel isolated or rushed because I'm a single diner.Star bagel is a great, casual place to have a leisurely breakfast sitting outside in Sylvan Park.  The iced coffee is strong and good (though there is a lot of ice, so I definitely recommend going for the ""large"" even if you're just a 1 cup a day coffee drinker). There's a variety of bagel sandwiches that are all under $4.  The bagels themselves aren't particularly special (they aren't NY style, if that's your thing), but they're totally fine. As a single diner, wi-fi is pretty important (when you need to entertain yourself with an iPad and to demonstrate to others that you're not a sad lonely soul eating brunch - the most social of all meals - alone). But this place is decidely anti-wifi. I respect that, but be warned. I download the news at home and take it with me.The other day I also brought home a greek salad to go.  I don't typically order salads at cafes anymore (because they're usually just there to appease people who only eat salads and are that strange combination of not being particularly good and yet are more expensive than most other items on the menu), but I wasn't that hungry and bought it as a security measure.  I ended up eating it the next day and was very surprised at how fresh and perfect it was! The salad was a simple affair - romaine, red onions, feta, olives, banana peppers - but it was so fresh (!!!) and well proportioned.  And the salad dressing was homemade and had a lot more heft than just oil/vinegar.  I might actually get it again sometime (even though it was over $5 and wouldn't alone satisfy a meal in a place where $4 gets you quite a bit of food, but that's just being relativistic).Also, I should note: some reviews complain about the difficulty snagging a spot in the parking lot, but I've never had a problem.",Star Bagel Cafe,6152927993,19 reviews,2011-10-09,"Nashville, TN",/biz/star-bagel-cafe-nashville,5.0,120,"Washington, DC",Dominique B.

They have six bagel sandwiches that over some pairing with scrambled eggs, cheese, bacon, turkey sausage, ham and even a spinach and mushroom omelet.

"4239 Nolensville PikeNashville, TN 37211",5.0,"This place is a true local bakery. I honestly had no idea this place was over here, which is surprising to me because I used to frequent the K&S Market that is the same strip mall. Anyway, this place was pretty busy when we stopped by around 4pm on a Sunday. I think that we were the only non hispanic customers in the store. The bakery is set up pretty straight forward. When you walk inside, the left side has drinks and refrigerated pies and cakes, on the right side is all the different pastries in glass, self serve cabinets. You grab a tray and tongs and pick out what you want. The trays are the same you get at a fast food restaurant that usually have the white paper liner. These trays don't have liners, I guess they clean them, but I wished they had some kind of parchment paper to put the items on instead of directly on the tray. There is a huge selections of conchas, Mexican sweet breads, churros, oreja, and pan de colotes. I didn't know these names until I googled for them. They don't have any names or prices listed at the cabinet area. They don't even have prices listed up at the front counter. We picked 5 different items and the total after tax was $4.46. Not bad at all. The guy that bagged our stuff was nice, the guy that rung us up was on his phone and didn't say the total or the change or anything. Of the 5 items we got, my favorite was the concha. I also liked the one item that looks like a triangle hot pocket that is filled with cream cheese (i think). The large round one with the strips was a little dry, but for the price I think that all of them were worth it.

"4239 Nolensville PikeNashville, TN 37211",5.0,"Sweet empanadas filled with cream cheese or pineapple. Tres Leches Cake. Those little gingerbread pigs. Conchas, ojo de buey, elephant ears, and other pan dulce galore. Not to mention the little freezer filled with mexican style popsicles (paletas) and ice creams. If this is what you're looking for, go here. If you don't recognize anything from the above list, stop by this little bakery and pick up a bag full of sweets instead of picking up a dozen donuts, you'll make new discoveries and be the hero at work.

When La Conchita opened about a year ago, I wanted to throw a party.The place is clean, neat, and generally friendly. It is definitely a family run business (complete with the occasional awkward teenager), they are very welcoming in both English and Spanish. They also have very reasonable prices (all the different items are about 60-90 cents a piece, and their Tres Leches Cakes are sold by the slice, or a whole cake for less than $20). They also seem good about seasonal items like pan de muerto around Dia de los Muertos, I think they sell Roscon around Three Kings Day. Although there are many hispanic style bakeries on Nolensville road selling Tres Leches and these other sweets, this one is my favorite and gets 5 stars for the friendly clean atmosphere, the prices (especially on the Tres Leches Cakes) and the fact that they have the best darn cream-cheese empanada de mil hoja that I have ever tasted, ever (and believe me, I've been around many panaderias).

"2100 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"A Good Breakfast Place to Try. It's located on a somewhat busy street, especially in the morning, so there might be some local traffic on the way there.  There is a decent amount of parking, but I've seen the parking lot full both times I've tried it out.  If it's during breakfast hours, you might have to play parking lot Tetris.  I ordered out the times I've been there.  People were friendly with the ordering process, and they got most of the things right, and the food was ready when I got there, although it took me way longer than expected because of traffic each time.  Onto to the food:The Eggs Benedict is good, but the hollandaise sauce seems to lack a bit of flavor.  I couldn't really taste much of it, and just seemed a bit plain to me.  Since I was vegetarian, I asked the ""Benny"" to be without bacon, but there was bacon on it anyway.  It wasn't that hard to remove, and I'm not one of those hardcore vegetarians that feel the world is ruined if some meat touches the bread (although I'm not fully vegetarian either, Hello Nathan's I got my eye on you!!) so it wasn't that big of a deal.  The potatoes that come with the dish were very plain, and lacked much taste at all.  I pretty much drowned it in ketchup after awhile, because it just had no flavor.  The quesadilla with mushrooms were actually pretty good, and a decent option to have other than eggs in the morning.  The guacamole wasn't good though, and very apparently not fresh.  After a few swipes, I left that alone, and just added hot sauce instead.  I think with fresh guacamole, this would be an excellent egg alternative dish.  The Huevos Avacado was good, probably the most well done of the dishes among the three that I tried (I skipped the Benny after the first time) and also feels lighter on the stomach afterwards.  This comes with black beans, and it was actually some good beans for a change, definitely had some flavor to it and goes well with the dish.  The pricing is a bit higher than I expected honestly, although I'm guessing it's because it's closer to the city than most of the places I eat at for breakfast.  I'm not sure this place stands apart enough for the prices to be slightly higher, it's pretty much standard affair that you can find at other chains as well.  I liked the service and parking lot (on a busy street), but otherwise I can't really say it was exceptional.  I wouldn't complain about eating here, but I also wouldn't drag anyone here just because they have to try this place.  I don't think people would be disappointed here, nor would they be wowed.",J.

I had the parfait and grits - and I thought you couldn't get better than standard fair stuff... but no they added extra flavor, texture, and the whole shebang to it. You also have amazingly fun waitresses who are very attentive and willing to strike up exciting conversations (not in any annoying way, but more like adding some sunshine to your morning type way) if you woke up on the right side of bed and are ready to smile.I don't do 5 stars much... but the place deserves every shiny star morsel.",J.

"2100 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"BE VERY WARY-My family and I ate at the Nashville J Christopher's yesterday 12/28/2013 for a late breakfast around 10:30.  We along with everyone else in Nashville were hopeful for another good choice for breakfast.Decor is interesting, a mismatch of different artist.  Interesting concept, and I liked some of the pieces enough to get artist names.Service was meh.  It took 5 minutes or so just to get water and coffee.  We ordered the following items1. The Huevos Avocado, English muffin, with poached (well) eggs, avacado which actually turned out to be guacamole, sour cream, and black beans in a cup.  Presentation on the plate was fair.  However first bite was luke warm.  I remember telling my wife throughout the entire meal that I really wish the food would have been hot.2.  The Pantry Feast-  two eggs soft scrambled, potatoes, bacon, and a ""crunch"" cake.  My wife first commented on the cold and limp bacon.  We both agreed that either warm and soft or cold and crunchy, but never cold and soft bacon.  The eggs were luke warm, the potatoes were lack luster.  No real seasoning.  The looked like they had come out of a Sysco frozen potato bag and put in the convection oven.  Unevenly done, some crispy and some soggy.   The crunch cake was dry, like it had been under a heat lamp for quite some time.3.  Grilled Cheese-  My youngest daughter wanted something more lunchy, so she chose the grilled cheese, which was oddly grilled, but the cheese wasn't melted.  You could still see the edges of the american cheese slice, which normally should just be a gooey delight.  Same mediocre potatoes.   We ate the meal, and when we left we said to ourselves we probably wouldn't come back and would stick with your tried and trued places.Now for the fun part.  After about 2 hours after eating, i began to feel a little queasy.  This meal was my only meal that day, so I just figured, it wasn't sitting well.  I continued to feel worse through the night, and then the diarrhea started and on going nausea which eventually lead to a four hour puking session.  I had to take a dose of nausea medication that a chemo patient would have to take, to eventually cause the vomiting to stop.  Seeing what I had for breakfast/lunch in front of me seven hours later pretty much determined the culprit.I frequent many establishments in this fair city that we call Nashville.  Each one that I goto I, TRUST, that they are following safe food handling practices, and I trust that cross contamination is mitigated at every chance.  This clearly is not the practice at this J. Christopher.I won't go back.  I will be calling the health department, and I will tell everyone I know about this experience.   If you go, make sure it's WELL DONE, and Hot when you get it.  Else you will fall victim to the vomit diarrhea nightmare that i experienced last night.",J.

Parking is super easy with a convenient side lot and even though I have been a couple of times during the week, I have yet to experience a wait.  On the plus side is a mini counter for single diners and solid service. On the minus side would be consistently undercooked bacon (something that one doesn't want tar tar!), lack of WiFi and teeny tiny drink cups that are 3/4 ice.

Our server recommended the mint tea to my husband while I stuck with water.I had the Cobb salad and my husband ordered a breakfast skillet that came with a biscuit. Our food came out SUPER fast and was relatively good. The salad was really filling and the avocado was excellent. My husband inhaled his food so I'm assuming it was also delish. The only reason this place gets 3 stars instead of 4 is price. My husband requested gravy for his biscuit which ran us $2.50 and the one bag of tea he used was also $2.50. It wasn't a specialty tea or anything, just standard Bigelow.Anyway, the food is okay and if it's your only option, it's not bad. Just a bit expensive for what it really is.",J.

"2100 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"My friend and I have a habit of making our way to Fido and Blvd for breakfast on Sunday mornings. One week we decided that we would do something preposterous. J Christophers helped us accomplish this goal.The store doesn't have a real theme. There are a handful of mismatched paintings on the wall, and the rows of booths are arranged in traditional diner style: two things that slip the scent of 'chain' and can cast a shadow over a great brunch stop (where would Bongo productions be without its flipped-antique theme?).But if you can get past the atmosphere, not be taken in by the $2 bottomless coffee, and finally open the menu, you find multiple pages of mouthwatering descriptions. And the best part is that the food these descriptions are linked to does not disappoint. The most difficult part of the experience--it is a real challenge--is deciding whether you want a skillet, an omelette, or a brunch platter of some sort (like their eponymous Eggs Christopher - something like a breakfast Kentucky Hot Brown). If the restaurant were Downtown, the food may come off as novel. Being just down the street from Fido, it's hardly anything you won't have heard of before, and you may find yourself wishing that there were more goat cheese and avocado on the menu.

The skillet had diced raw onions, which didn't really work for me.  When I asked to leave the bacon out of the skillet and substitute an extra egg, I got charged for the extra egg.

The food is really solid in terms of being true Italian food. Every now and then it's a bit off, but there aren't many other places in Nashville to get true Italian food. Worth checking out for sure, would recommend for a couple on date night or small family get together.

"4671 Trousdale DrNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"I was on a long road trip from Miami, Fl to Niagara Falls. I was very very hungry and needed a place to eat. Being with the vegan bf makes it hard to eat anywhere. So I start looking for Italian bc that's actually the easiest for the both of us to find something. We stumbled across this gem. It is in a weird location. It's like behind a gas station, but don't be put off by that. The place inside is great. The walls are filled with artwork and the mood lighting is very intimate. The staff was very friendly and attentive throughout our entire meal. I had the mozzarella sticks. I know it sounds pretty standard, but let me tell you: I was so happy that I ordered these. They were anything but basic. I can't put my finger on it, but there was something so delicious. There was something that made it taste like no other mozzarella stock I ever had. I think it may have been the blend of cheeses and the breading was different and very tasty. The free bread sticks are amazing. They are deliciously buttered and seasoned. The house sauce accompanied the bread. It was a delicious marinara like sauce. I ordered the chicken parmesan with spaghetti and the vegan bf ordered spaghetti with the house sauce and no cheese.The chicken parmesan was a big piece of chicken that was not dry at all. The crust and cheese that was on the chicken was very good. The cheese was perfectly melted and It all worked so well together. The pasta was perfectly done and the sauce was so good. I was happy that it was the same sauce that was served with the bread sticks. I couldn't finish it all. It was a large portion so I took some to the hotel. Luckily the hotel had a microwave... I had it for breakfast the next day. Don't judge me. Oh! Before I forget- talking with the staff I found out the chicken is organic. I told them they should put that on the menu since I think that's a great selling point. It made sense that it was organic though. I was full, but I didn't get the gross feeling of overeating and wanting to die. I just felt pleasantly plump.  The vegan said he liked his pasta alot and offered alot of flavor for such a simple dish. He was happy they adhered to his request of no cheese and that they were able to recite what ingredients were in his food to quell his nervousness of eating something he can't. Although, he almost broke for the bread sticks. Sadly, the breadsticks are lightly brushed with butter. He was eating them with his eyes! I didn't get dessert because I was so full, but the have a variety of of portions that all sounds delicious. I wish I had access to this place all the time. It would have become my go-to spot for dinner. The food didn't get me sick to my stomach which is always my fear in life since I tend to have tummy issues and I was on a road trip.This place was def a good choice. Easy to get in and get out of the parking lot and close to the major hwy we were driving.",Mama Mias,6153317207,33 reviews,2015-09-05,"Miami, FL",/biz/mama-mias-nashville,5.0,77,"Washington, DC",Yamille H.
"4671 Trousdale DrNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"My boyfriend took me here last night and I wasn't really impressed. My boyfriend loves this restaurant and defended everything I said about it, but something's weren't really defendable. First off, it's really confusing because on the outside its super dingy and tiny and its next to a busy street and a gas station, so it's not the best location for this restaurant because it looks really nice on the inside. So as for the food, the main course wasn't as good as I was expecting for the price that it was. And as an appetizer my boyfriend ordered mussels, which weren't actually on the menu but they had them anyway. We didn't get our bread until the mussels came out and that was a bit of a wait. But when the mussels actually came out, they smelled like my dog, which was a little unsettling. They tasted fine though I guess. I think the worst part though was that when they brought out my water, there was a tiny dead bug in it. So that was pretty gross, I ended up taking my boyfriends water instead, then when they brought me a replacement water, there was like paper or something floating around in it. Sooo check your water before you drink it. One last thing, it was freezing cold in the restaurant. I mean that could happen at any other restaurant, but just have a sweater o hand just in case.",Mama Mias,6153317207,6 reviews,2015-06-16,"Nashville, TN",/biz/mama-mias-nashville,3.0,77,"Washington, DC",Ellen D.
"4671 Trousdale DrNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"I usually don't write reviews after only visiting once, but I doubt I'll be back anytime soon since I don't live in Nashville!I just want to say that the food here was superb for the price! It's true, the service was a little slow. The restaurant wasn't very busy and yet we waited an unnecessary length of time to be seated. But it was totally worth it!To start, you can bring in your own wine, and there is a wine and spirit shop conveniently located next door. We ordered the appetizer sampler and it was very good. I was most excited for the mozzarella sticks (homemade!), but these ended up being the weakest link of the meal. They were mostly all bread with very little cheese. The meatballs on the other hand more than made up for it, as they were top notch! The bruschetta was some of the best I have had, even though this is what I was looking the least forward to! I believe there was even some prosciutto on those bad boys!I ordered the chicken mimmosa which was scrumptious! Too bad at this point I was already mostly full so didn't make it too far into my entree. This is never a bad problem to have though!This might not be the *best* Italian place ever, but for a middle tier option, it is the bees knees! I find that it is hard to find above average Italian food without going full-blown fine dining.

"4671 Trousdale DrNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"Mom & pop home cooked Italian food. Menu is simple & all the dishes are really quite tasty. As appetizers we ordered mozzarella sticked that were huge & good. We also ordered a caprese salad, the tomatoes & the mozzarella was so fresh & it all flew off the plates. The garlic bread is large, buttery & hot. So good. With your entrees it includes a house salad. (No cesar salad unfortunately.) Also, I didn't care much for the house salad & their Italian dressing. My dinner made up for it though. I ordered the cheese tortellini calabresse. It was very good with the grilled mushrooms, onions, red peppers & sausages. The BF ordered chicken Marsala & while the chicken was good the Marsala sauce was too sweet for his taste.  For dessert we ordered the Tiramisu & it was really very very good. Why the 3 star review for such great food all around? Well, the service was crap & it took over an hour to get our food for a party of 8. Also, our waitress just dropped the check on our table before even asking if we want coffee or dessert. We had to tell her we weren't done & wanted dessert. It was also really weird how they brought out our food 2 or 1 at a time & it took a while until we all had our food. Not to mention that we all didn't get menus & it took a long time for her to take our order. Another annoying but about the crappy service is that one of the members of our party had a 3 year old & as soon swear river we asked for a high chair. It took them 15 minutes until we finally got the high chair & after asking a 2nd & 3rd time.

I have read several reviews on here that I find suspicious. Our waiter was very attentive and spent just the right amount of time at our table and was very friendly. Our food was delicious as usual. I had the pesto pasta. The prices for what you get is excellent. 4 of us ate dinner for less than 60$. They do not serve alcohol but there is a sprits store next door and they only charge 5$ for a cork fee.

"4671 Trousdale DrNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"This is one of the most bittersweet reviews I have written on Yelp. I have lived within a mile of Mama Mias for about five years now and never have once tried it until last night. I always heard good things from people throughout the community, but for some reason never stopped in to give them a chance. That is the bitter part of this review because I have been missing many years of wonderful Italian comfort food. Nonetheless, the sweet is the sweetest because my wife and I have a new favorite Italian restaurant. As we indulged in our meal we quickly realized we were experiencing something special. The food was perfectly executed. Not over salted, the right amount of cheese, and FRESH ingredients...this my friends are the keys to great Italian food. Do not be fooled by the other low ratings that were given for this restaurant...the will only deter you from the true definition of deliciousness. I understand everyone's pallet is different but realize that real Italian food is not ""Pizza Hut"". Fast food Italian is all preservatives, tons of salt and cheese, they do this to mask how bad the food is because cheese makes everything somewhat better. As for folks saying they were slow, that's incorrect. We were informed as soon as we were seated that all the food prepared is made from scratch so it takes a little longer. We were there 1 hour and five minutes with salads, two baskets of bread, mozzarella sticks for an app, our dinner courses, and finished a whole bottle of wine. Again, this is not fast food. This is a restaurant that produces quality, made from scratch food. I do not mind one taking a little extra time in preparing food in order to receive a quality product at the end. Trust me, do yourself a favor and try them out. I battled a while if I was going to write a review because I did not want anybody to know of this place, but it would not be a service to Mama Mias. Everyone should come and be loved at this place. Do something your future self will thank you for later...eat here.",Mama Mias,6153317207,55 reviews,2014-12-19,"Nashville, TN",/biz/mama-mias-nashville,5.0,77,"Washington, DC",Jay G.
"4671 Trousdale DrNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"My friend and I have been stalking this place for awhile. we work fairly close by but they were closed for a few months, but we finally got in a few weeks ago. looks like they have remodeled according to my friend who had been there before. So whenevery i try a out a new Italian restaurant, I get a few certain items to judge.1. obiviously the tomato sauce is key, and Mama Mia's has a pretty decent one. Its not the best but in the top 3 of the Nashville restaurants i've tried.2. The bread with olive oil and herbs (and ideally balsamic vinegar too) theirs was fresh and hot, you could tell it was the same they use for the crust of the pizza, but thats ok, at least they presented it3. My favorite is the quattro formaggi - they do theirs right, with italian cheeses (and a lot of them) i had them stuffed into a calzoni and they added basil leaves as well, which made it that much more delicious!Overall a great little gem in Crieve Hall, good for date night or lunch.",Mama Mias,6153317207,131 reviews,2013-12-11,"Portland, OR",/biz/mama-mias-nashville,4.0,77,"Washington, DC",Laila S.

My order for a meatball sandwich was taken relatively quickly. By twenty past twelve I was ready to ditch this place. The sandwich finally got to my table about five minutes later. Great sandwich done right, meatballs sliced in half and layered thru the Italian bread. The sauce was tangy, the mozzarella melted, and the sweet pepper I requested was cooked perfect.I had to be at the Nashville airport so I had to search out my waitress to get my check. Figures, she was in back yappin with the other one. Of course, the other one gets busy and disappears when I show up.

"4671 Trousdale DrNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"I am so sad to have to leave a bad review for this restaurant. I have heard great things about it, but, experienced the opposite tonight. My father owns restaurants and has taught me the importance of supporting family owned businesses but tonight this one puts family owned businesses to shame.I liked the intimate atmosphere. It is dimly lit and is great for a nice date night. After waiting for a while after placing our order, we received our salad (iceberg lettuce, a slice of tomato, carrots) and breadsticks (breadsticks were pretty good!). At this point, we were underwhelmed but still anticipating an amazing meal.And when I say anticipating...we anticipated a great meal for 25 minutes before we actually received our food. I ordered the Ravioli (can't remember the name but had a cream sauce with chicken and mushrooms) and my husband ordered the chicken marsala. When I received my meal, it was luke warm - the cheese that was supposed to be melted on top was hard...I typically do not send food back but I could not handle the fact that it had clearly been sitting out so I graciously sent it back to be heated up, recooked-whatever. When I received it back (within 3 minutes) it was obvious that it had just been microwaved to a molten lava temperature causing the chicken's texture to literally resemble plastic. I had about 3 bites - I could not handle it (I am the LEAST picky person in the world - if I won't eat something, you know it's bad). My husband's chicken marsala was soup. The sauce was runny and flavorless. He had about 3 bites. The server asked us if we wanted to go boxes and we declined. She paid no attention to the fact that we were clearly unsatisfied. As I said, my father owns restaurants, I understand there are mistakes and no one is perfect. But, the thing that bothered me was that we were not taken care of by any means. No manager came out to apologize for the 25 minute delay in our food - let alone apologize that mine came out nearly cold. This is the attention to detail patrons go to family owned businesses for. Our bill was about $45 for 5 bites of terrible food and a sad feeling that this family owned business would treat their patrons this way.",Mama Mias,6153317207,1 review,2014-11-08,"Fort Riley, KS",/biz/mama-mias-nashville,1.0,77,"Washington, DC",Melissa B.
"4671 Trousdale DrNashville, TN 37204",3.5,Don't be fooled by the exterior. When you walk inside you are transported to a candlelit and intimate little Italian nook. It is simple yet romantic. The prices are extremely reasonable and its BYOB. They do charge a small corking fee. The servers have always been very nice and helpful when it comes to suggesting delicious menu items. I know a lot of people on here have mentioned slow service however that has never been a problem for me. These dishes are cooked to order though so that can slow it down a little more! I gave them 4 out of 5 stars because of their menu changes. I actually like their old menu much better. I have had a couple of dishes on the new menu that I didn't love. Their classics like their lasagna and manicotti are great. The seafood dishes I've had I didn't love. I noticed this time they've added some lighter pasta dishes that I look forward to trying. Their salads are always delicious as is their bread basket.

"4671 Trousdale DrNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"Slow, slow slow. I went last night thinking it might be OK to eat there when it's half empty. It is not. Walked in at around 7 PM for a table for two. The restaurant had several open tables and a waitress was cleaning the carpet when we got there. That's generally a good sign, wait staff trying to keep themselves busy. We were seated immediately with menus. 20 minutes later we were still sitting there. No water, no greeting, no nothing. Finally got some water and we ordered our meals. I got the Veal piccata, my friend got something that I don't even remember what it's called. Wide noodles with some sort of tomato sauce and goat cheese. 30 minutes after we ordered we got bread and we were invited to order salad dressing for our salad. Our waiter hyped up the bleu cheese as the best in the area. It is not. We were given one roll each and when I asked for more bread, I got a fairly mean look and a lot of talk about not eating too much bread. Really? Here's a tip waiter: Wait on us and shut up. 20 minutes after our salads we got our simple pasta meals. He set down our dishes and said he would be right back with cheese. My piccata was OK...nothing to write home about, but the noodles were al dente. The veal itself was not that great. Just a small to medium veal chop on top of some noodles. The wide noodles....nasty. The tomato sauce was super sweet, like Papa John's sweet. Anyways, my friend thought she'd wait for cheese to try to rescue her dish. 15 minutes pass. Nothing. I finally flag down somebody to get cheese, and he looks at our dishes like, ""Hold on there, I already put fucking cheese on your dish..."" and he gave me an annoyed look and a sigh before getting the cheese and grating some on our dishes. 2 hours, 1 water refill. Glass was empty for the majority of the time. Our waiter...wow. I tried to like him, but in the end he was just annoying and took forever. He had a ""charming"" accent, but in the end he spent most of the time talking to my female friend rather than addressing both of us, which I found super annoying. The restaurant is very tiny and he had no more than 4 parties at one time. No excuse.  The back breaker: 2 hours after we sit, we finally got a bill. There was an extra 6 dollar charge on the hand written check, for which I could find no reason. It was either for asking for cheese on our dishes or for the extra 2 rolls. Either that or he thought he had uncorked some wine for us. I didn't feel like dealing with it so I left what he asked for plus a tip. But that will be my last tip ever for them, because I am not going back. Summary: stingy with bread, stingy with water, time wasters. Too dark as well. Meal for two, no drinks just water. No apps, no desserts. 57 dollars. Also, MC or Visa or Cash only. Thumbs down.",Mama Mias,6153317207,80 reviews,2013-06-21,"Nashville, TN",/biz/mama-mias-nashville,2.0,77,"Washington, DC",Howard L.
"4671 Trousdale DrNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"Considering Mama Mia's is stuck in between two gas stations, I never assumed much when I drive past this place. However, a friend's recommendation persuaded me to give it a chance. Turns out, this is one of the most straightforward dining experiences you can have. There's no flair, no overdecoration, no superfriendly waiters. In fact, there is very little waiter presence at all. It's just good food. I'm not sure I'd be bold enough to say it's the best italian in town, since I've really only tried major chains, but it's certainly not a stretch to say that this is better than most. It might not be cheap, but I'm not sure of any nice Italian restaurants that are. The portions are also very generous, leaving me with plenty leftover for the next day.Adding benefit is the restaurant's BYOB status. The corking fee may be annoying, but it's still cheaper than buying wine at any other restaurant. Plus, in addition to the donut shop and aforementioned gas stations, Mama Mia's shares a parking lot with a liquor store, making it easy to grab a bottle before walking in.That they're able to survive in such an odd location with what would generally be considered awful service is a testament to how good their food is.

I've had better cheese sticks at Sonic, but the calamari was quite good. Not rubbery at all.Salads: Terrible. Dressings were not good, and the salad is just a bowl of lettuce with a slice of tomato and some black olives.Main dishes: Mediocre.

They also own Back to Cuba cafe pretty much next door. Check that place out too. Both located where you'd never see it unless you were looking for it.In short, I won't even go into specific entrees because everything I've ever gotten is amazing. But I will note that their bruschetta is by far the best I've even had. Good portions, reasonable prices. My husband and I are in agreement that this place is the best. Most people we know that have eaten here have said the same.I noticed some of the lower reviews are not about the food, but about the wait and service. We know this place is popular and they don't take reservations. So we always go to dinner around 5:30 or 6 and don't have a problem at all.

We picked this location for a work group outing, and we couldn't have been more pleased. First of all, the service was excellent. While the dining area is fairly small, they seated our group of 10 right away for lunch. Our server was attentive but not overbearing. As we waited for a few stragglers in our group to arrive, out came this gooey, buttery, delicious garlic bread on the house! I think I had four pieces! Everything on the lunch menu ranged from about $7-13, from salads and strombolis to pasta and pizza dishes. I ordered a Marinara pasta dish that was fantastic! Everyone at our table ooohed and awed as their dish came out and the praises kept coming even after the food was cleared into our tummies.

I had the chicken raviolis.  They were tasty but like said worth about $10. The cheese sticks we got we a nice size but the forgot to melt the cheese on the inside so it was just a big piece of what felt like rubber on inside. Not sure how you mess up cheese sticks?

Well we found out that the head chef wasn't there that night as he/she had to go to the emergency room. The staff informed us they had a very limited menu that night which disappointed us. But the food was still good and the service was great. Since it was slow the waiter sung Happy Birthday to my gf.

I had the mama stravaganza which is a sampler plate, I got manicotti, lasagna, and chicken parmesan. My husband had the pesto, the pesto was delicious, but my sampler plate all tasted similar, so next time I'll get just one type of entree. The owner of the restaurant is the cook and she actually owns the cuban restaurant just down the street as well. She herself is from Cuba and is seriously the sweetest person you'll ever meet.

We arrived and we were greeted by a friendly female who sat us at our table and took our drink orders. I asked for iced tea, and she said the restaurant did not have any (this is a first - what restaurant would not have iced tea?). I then asked what she had that was sugar free, and she said normally Diet Coke, but that the soda machine was broken. She said my only sugar free beverage choice was a glass of tap water. Definitely not a good way to start the meal at a restaurant that strives to be 'fine dining' with $15-20 dollar entrees.A male waiter then comes to our table asking to take our order before we had a chance to even look at the menu. We asked what he recommended and he said ""everything"". That did not help us narrow our selection.We both order the Siciliana with Bolognese (spaghetti with meat sauce), with a side of meatballs. The salad comes out and was fine. The dressing seemed to be store bought and not from scratch, but it wasn't a big deal. The garlic bread we received was stale and hard as if it had been reheated in the microwave a few too many times and was dripping in butter. We left it in the basket. Gross.The meal then arrives and we begin to eat. First off, they got the order entirely wrong - we ordered Bolognese sauce and they served it with Marinara sauce instead. The sauce was so sweet that my dinner companion said it tasted more like a dessert than a dinner entree! The meatballs were ok, but cold in the center as if they had been re-heated, and the pasta (which they told us was from scratch) was out of a box (yes, i can easily tell the difference).The entire experience reminded me of the Food Network show Sandra Lee/Semi Homeade. Its as if they were trying to be fine dining, but it was an epic failure.My dinner guest could not eat his meal because it had so much sugar in the sauce (and they put the wrong sauce on the pasta to begin with). The restaurant did take it off the bill, but made some odd comment about ""had you eaten more than 25% of it, we would not have been able to remove it from the bill"". isn't that an odd thing to say in a 'fine dining' establishment?In a nutshell, Mama Mia's may be fine as a $5.99 lunch special dive, but as a dinner/fine dining establishment, it has a long way to go.",Mama Mias,6153317207,8 reviews,2011-08-12,"Nashville, TN",/biz/mama-mias-nashville,2.0,77,"Washington, DC",Steve M.

For an entree, my boyfriend ordered the sampler plate of lasagna, manicotti, and chicken parmesan and thought it was just ""alright"". I tried a bite of each and again, thought the sauce was very bland. For my meal, I went with the one of the pizzas. The outer crust was just barely crisp, but the underside of the pie was like eating RAW DOUGH! I ate one slice and just couldn't sit there and eat anymore! To give them the benefit of the doubt, I got a to-go box and took the pizza home with us. The next day, we heated up the leftovers for lunch and even after 20 minutes in the oven, it was STILL doughy. We ended up throwing it away!

"4671 Trousdale DrNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"Four words: best. Italian. in. Nashville. There's no point in writing specifics about the food because it's all amazing. They do not take reservations and it's a small (snug? intimate?) place. If you go on a Friday or Saturday night be prepared for a long (and possibly frustrating) wait. It's worth it (but if you really hate waiting, go at 5:30 or on a weeknight - don't skip it entirely!). Sometimes it does seem as if the staff is a bit disorganized and/or overwhelmed. Don't let what I'm about to say deter you, but it's really better to go when you are relaxed (i.e. you are in the mood for a nice, long evening with your honey, rather than you are grumpy because you haven't eaten all day and you are trying to fit dinner in before catching a movie). Mama Mia's is a great date spot. Because it's so cozy and busy, I personally would not go with more than 4 or 5, but I often see large groups there during high traffic hours and they seem to make it work.  They don't serve wine, so bring your own and plan to pay a small corking fee.

"4671 Trousdale DrNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"Great place to go for a low-key, authentic Italian dinner!  It doesn't look like much from the outside--heck or from the inside.  It's clean but small, and they have the requisite checkered tablecloths and candles on the tables, but it's nothing too fancy.  Doesn't need to be.  If the food is good (it's outstanding) that's all that matters!  I suggest reservations, just because it's again, a small place, but they do take walk-ins.  Just be prepared to wait.  Another thing I love about it is that you have to bring your own wine--they don't serve it!  It's a $5 cork fee (pretty sure on that) which really, is a deal if you think about what most restaurants make you pay for a bottle of ho-hum wine.  This way, you bring whatever you want and only pay a minimal price.  Most meals come with a salad and delicious buttery, garlicy breadsticks all for a very reasonable price.  I usually get out of there for about $15.  Great for date night, or night out with the girls.  I've never had bad service either!  Mama Mia's is one place I'll go back to time and again.",Mama Mias,6153317207,374 reviews,2008-04-25,"Nashville, TN",/biz/mama-mias-nashville,4.0,77,"Washington, DC",Robin S.

Been there only twice - and the first time (6 months ago) was a good experience overall. Not overly impressed with the atmosphere or service - but the food was outstanding. Then, last week we went back only to find the service was atrocious (slow and inattentive to basic needs). We went early on a Saturday to avoid the rush but it didn't matter. Many around us had the same problem and at least one couple walked out. After an hour - we finally were served and the food was actually quite good. But the wait and hassle were simply not worth it.

I cannot recall a visit where the service was good. Be careful on holidays because they offer only prix fixe menus that rely heavily on meat or seafood. Found this out the hard way when we were denied our usual dish on Valentines Day, thus requiring us to change our plans on a very busy dining day after we had been seated. They charge a corking fee also.  You would think that after having a rehearsal dinner there, having various holiday dinners there, and bringing new people often that they would be more sensitive to a long time customer's expectations and holiday plans.

Unfortunately, Friday night will be my last date night there with my man. We've done it many times. He now refuses to set foot in the restaurant again after once again having terribly poor service. The food is usually spot on and phenomenal but you have to be prepared to WAIT. Not sure if they're just understaffed or if they are being very literal with the Italian flair and think dining should take 3 hours. I think that is fine when you have a large party (hence, the word party) and are visiting with one another. When it is you and your significant other that you see every day, we're mainly there to eat, drink and get on our merry way.

The entrees are very good and plentiful. I tend to go for the cream sauces with my favorite dish being the Chicken Florentine which consists of a large chicken breast, flattened and grilled over a bed of pasta with an amazing creamy, cheese sauce. Only the added spinach keeps it from falling into the completely sinful category. Because of it I only go a few times a year, doctors orders!! The red sauce items are good as well.

"4671 Trousdale DrNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"Mama Mia's is a well-met mid-range Italian ristorante  owned by the unpretentious geniuses behind near-by Back to Cuba. Making smart use of darkness and candles, the place manages a romantic atmosphere despite officelike drop-ceilings and situation in the midst of the ramshackle not-so-romantic interesection/gas-station plaza at Harding Rd. and Trousdale. But such humility seems to be the common trait of most of the best culinary gems; I think of Gira Polli's old little nook of a place in North Beach... The menu hosts an array of standards from north and south Italy, and a few interesting slightly obscurer things. Salads are not extraordinary but do the job, and include olives as well as the usual romaine/iceberg mix topped with tomatoes and onions .  The bruschetta appetizer has a flavorful topping of diced tomato, garlic, onion, basil and pancetta, and the bread is the same kind you get on a cuban pork sandwich: wide, buttery, white and warm but perhaps not toasted enough for our taste. The saltimboca is the house special and features a delicious sauce and includes a side-dish of spinach gnocchi in marinara. The service was very accomodating to our dietary idiosyncrasies.

Overall, the atmosphere is great -- wide open room, rustic finishes, live music and the ability to accommodate large parties. As for the waitstaff, I can vouch for the other reviews here when I say service takes forever. After sitting at our table for about 20 minutes this morning, we had to walk up to the bar to let the staff know we hadn't been given menus/been greeted. Puzzling, since it wasn't crowded. I made the mistake of going there hungry - it took close to an hour before we were given our plates for the buffet. Side note on the buffet: pretty basic, and not replenished from the time we got our table to when we got our plates. Except the bacon was bangin' - but can bacon ever really be bad? The bottomless mimosas always seem like a great idea, but take forever to be refilled, so I'm not sure it makes much sense to go that route - they're small glasses and you end up averaging about 2-3. The menus were printed on computer paper with a printer that was clearly running out of ink, as some lines couldn't be read. Nit picky comment, but I'm taking the time to leave this review so I figured I'd throw in all of the deets.

Luckily, Listening Room Cafe had complimentary valet, so we chose to dine there for lunch. The restaurant is very open, with tables facing a large stage. At first, I was pretty excited to hear some live music. It was too bad, however, that all 3 singer/songwriters were just okay--nothing too impressive. The food and service wasn't much better. Although our hostess quickly seated us, we had to wait at least 15 minutes for a server to even take our order--and that was only after we flagged her down. Furthermore, our server perpetually had a frown on her face and didn't even smile once. I don't think we saw any of the staff look friendly. They just looked really unhappy and bored to be there. Not a good sign.I ordered the All American Scramble (omelette with cheese, kielbasa, and gravy sauce) and it was just okay. For $13, I was expecting something much better, but the omelette was kind of dry and one note. The restaurant was also serving a buffet option for $18, but by the looks of it, it wasn't worth the money. Very small selection of food items.

"217 2nd Ave SNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"Eeehh. This was not a great experience for me. With out of town guests, a group of us decided to do a touristy brunch at the Listening Room Cafe. We came in around 10:30am with live music starting at 11:30am. Our table had about 7 people and the place was pretty empty with the exception of maybe 5 other tables (the place is pretty large). They offer a buffet for $18.00 that looked very similar to a continental breakfast at a Holiday Inn. No thanks. So we sat down and looked over the menu. I decided on the veggie flatbread with bacon instead of french fries that come with it normally. They offer bottomless mimosas/bloody mary's for the reasonable price of $15.00 if I remember correctly. I did not partake but had a sip and they were pretty solid. Not all orange juice and mixed properly. That's where the good ends. We waited an hour for our food. Then they broke restaurant rule #1. They brought out 3 entrees and then we waited at least another 10-15 minutes before the rest of our table got their food. Seriously? No one had silverware either, so we had to wait be able to eat our brunch. I was very cranky at this point and starving. Much to my chagrin, I discovered that my veggie flatbread was not a pizza, but rather a clump of veggies and a tiny bit of hummus in a thick bland pita, and made like a sandwich. Huh? Since when does flatbread = sandwich?  On top of that it was bland and boring once I started eating. The bacon was OK and they brought out french fries anyway. Unfortunately, the poor food didn't stop there. The burger was just OK, the chicken and waffles had completely unseasoned and dry fried chicken that needed salt. It was a huge portion, so I ate some of that since my flatbread was not good and left me hungry. I was not a happy diner. NOTE: One person ordered the pancakes and said they were very good, so all the food wasn't a let down, but I can't speak from experience.I must shed light on the performers who were very good and entertaining. They were the only saving grace of this meal and sounded awesome. It was definitely neat to be able to enjoy their music at this venue.

"217 2nd Ave SNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"3.5It's right there in the name: come here for the music, stay for the drinks and patio after the set... you can probably skip the food. The Listening Room can give you a pretty decent night out (especially in good weather) but you have to know why you're coming and choose your experience accordingly.As anyone who's visited can tell you, it's a cool venue. From the moment you walk in, you can feel the musical electricity. The stage is the real deal. It's not overly fancy; it's just legit. You know it when you see it. Other venues may have more cache, but the LRC is no slouch. If you're set to see a show here, be excited. Parking can be a bit of an issue but they have a (free?) valet. If Tom is working, he'll take good care of you and your vehicle.Since it's a music venue, one would hope the drink program is up to par. It is. I came here on a Wednesday night in early autumn and was on a red ale kick. The only one I saw on draft was Fat Bottom's Ruby -- which was a-ok with me, as I'd been drinking a lot of it... but that's when I saw the rest: there were four tubs of hooch! Forget the suds. I can get that anytime. Bring on the hooch! Since I needed to be presentable (at least, that's what I told myself), I decided on the tasty but not knock-you-out Fancy Lemonade: vodka, simple syrup, lemon, soda. Very drinkable. Good for a hot day. I wanted to try the watermelon drink that had moonshine or the Blowin' Smoke drink which had whiskey but the bartender told me both were pretty strong and, again, I needed to be coherent so...When the music's in between sets or you need to talk (don't ever talk during a performance), take your drink and hit the patio. There's not much of a view right now but once the amphitheater gets built up, you've got a game changer on your hands. The only real letdown is the food program. My Caesar salad was mealy and my portabella burger was cold & rubbery. The food would have been a rather unfortunate end to a decent evening had I not observed a woman spitting the worst game I've ever heard to a guy who couldn't care less. I thought only dudes did stuff like that. The beautiful disaster that woman brought to my life made me almost forget about the bad taste in my mouth.",Listening Room Cafe,6152593600,1642 reviews,2015-03-30,"Nashville, TN",/biz/listening-room-cafe-nashville,3.0,144,"Washington, DC",Johnny T.

"217 2nd Ave SNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"This was one of my favorite live music experiences in Nashville. I could easily picture the talent we saw Amber's Drive at the Listening Room Cafe breaking out and making it big and I assume their other scheduled gigs are equally impressive. The sound system and acoustics were excellent! The venue is spacious and clean with friendly staff. You can reserve a seats online and they start seating 15 minutes before the performance. The hostesses have the system nailed down and quickly seat guests. We placed a drink order and our waiter had our cocktails well before served before the show began.The drink menu consists of an excellent selection of drafts, cocktails and wine. While we only partook in drinks the food smelled delicious and looked to be large portions. I ordered a malbec and later a champagne cocktail named berries and bubbles.

"217 2nd Ave SNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"We had a great time tonight! Makers series with four very different artists. We all enjoyed it. The beauty of this sort of gig is that they aren't specifically country music influences which appeals to the non-country fans. Artists ranged from experienced to new performers but they all did a great job in letting their personalities shine. The place was only half full on a Thurs night. Venue is very nice, has great acoustics with a warm ambience. We all ordered dinner. Food was good. Mac cheese balls were overpowered by Parmesan in my opinion. The smoked chicken was good but mine was a little dry in places. My friends was perfectly moist. I grabbed some BBQ sauce and it was great. The black eyed peas, green beans, corn on cob and sweet tator tots were all good. I had two cocktails- the pear, which was very enjoyable, and the seedling which was good but I wish I'd skipped the black pepper  garnish. We all agreed it was a very pleasant night and would absolutely go back.

"217 2nd Ave SNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"Wonderful night of music!!! Our server was fantastic!!! I attended the dinner and a show on 7/11/2015 with my mom and two kids (4 and 9). The kids shared an order of chicken fingers and fries, washing it down with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. They were enthralled with the music and even danced! The food was good. Their menu is in a state of flux with a new chef, so some items like pork chops are no longer available. I ordered a plate of pulled pork and side of mashed potatoes. Again the menu wasn't updated, so it didn't list pepper as the main spice in the mash. My mom is allergic and this made her very unhappy. The server apologized and brought out a huge slice of cheesecake with chocolate and raspberry drizzle. The venue was very spacious and had tables that sat four people, but a few were pushed together to accommodate a larger group. Lots of couples on dates or small groups kicking off their Saturday night. Originally I was quoted a bucket of beer was ten dollars, but when the bill came it was $20! The server did correct the price without hesitation. I think it must be very confusing to not only customers but servers too if the menu is not updated. This would only be my only suggestion to Mr. Blair, if you have a new chef please print out an updated menu to showcase a short bio and a list of the new  offerings. Please discard the nasty old stained file folders and just print it on heavy card stock. It wasn't a great first impression to sit down and see old file folders on the tables; it made me think about work and I wanted to relax;) The musicians were very talented: Bill Griese and Julie Gribble. I bought both of their CDs to listen to in the car back to Georgia. Very wonderful, authentic Nashville experience!!!

"217 2nd Ave SNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"I love live music, which works out well since I live in Austin, TX. However, this also means I have high standards and happily the Listening Room did not disappoint. First, be sure to get reservations. They are free (at least they were every night that we were visiting Nashville) but it guarantees you have a spot to sit. Without a reservation, you are guaranteed to either stand in the back of the room or not be allowed in at all. Even with a reservation, get there early! We arrived 30 minutes before the music started and were one of the last tables seated.Second, eat before you come. The food is definitely not the best, but you aren't coming for the food anyway. To note, we ordered the fried pickles and they were overly sweet, almost like they were cooked/rolled in a syrup before being fried. Not really what I want in a pickle. My husband also ordered the Mac and cheese, which was tasty, but a very small portion. The drinks were tasty, a little on the small side, but good. I had the watermelon crawl and it was delicious - they were out of watermelon, so they made it was pear juice. I guess I technically had a pear crawl, but still tasty! The music is AMZING. We stopped in on a Monday, where they were featuring the Song Suffragettes, as they do every Monday. The set consisted of 5 female singer/songwriters and each was beautiful and incredibly talented.

Our server confirmed this, even though on the wall inside it listed the first musical act as starting at noon. But we thought, well if it's at 11:30, that's ok. It didn't start until noon, and well after we had finished eating.  The food options were overwhelming and overpriced (I guess to pay the musicians?).

When trying to find the right space in Nashville for our party, I stumbled across the Listening Room Cafe by pure chance but it was exactly the place I was looking for to host our event. The decoration is rustic interiors with brick background, wood beams and elevated ceilings. The sound system is amazing and they have a projector as well to use for tv or your own a-v hookups. There is also plenty of parking for your guests which is a HUGE plus in the downtown area considering there are parking lots at every turn and corner. The outdoor patio has a nice view of the Nashville skyline and is a great place to catch a drink on a cool evening. The Owner was a pleasure to work with and helped work through every little request I had. He even helped the kitchen prepare a custom menu with a authentic home recipe for our guests which came out incredible. We created a customized menu and bar menu for our guests and they were willing to accomodate all of my requests.  I especially enjoyed the local Yazoo beers on tap. I got to try a lot of the offerings on the menu and highly recommend the fried pickles, southern fried chicken, whiskey salmon, and broccoli casserole.  Our guests left the evening with an awesome and authentic Nashville experience and I even got on stage and played a song to close out the evening. If you are searching for a place with character, a place where you can support a local business owner with a vision and dream of the perfect singer-songwriter venue, and a place that just gushes with that local Nashville flavor then I highly recommend the listening room cafe.

They have a giant banner on the side of there building, printed on their door, and printed on their menus that Brunch was served Saturday and Sunday from 10 am to 3 pm. We arrived Saturday at 10 am.

The restaurant ran out of food for the breakfast buffet, so many members of our group were waiting on their food or unable to get basic menu items. My mind was blown by how poor an experience it was.

"217 2nd Ave SNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"Overall, I had an exceptional time with my girlfriend at the Listening Room Cafe. We went on a Saturday night with singer and songwriter Vanessa Bransan, AJ Engstrom, and Phil Barton performing. They were amazing and made the night enjoyable for us and everyone else. We both really enjoy the opportunity after the show to meet and chat with the artist, and also get pictures and autographs from them. Vanessa was so sweet and nice to my girlfriend and me, and Phil was very personable when we chatted with him. We didn't get to talk to AJ, but he was very comedic onstage and had a great personality. We both really enjoyed the ambience provided at the Listening Room Cafe. Our waitress was very courteous and nice. She did a tremendous job trying to wait on her tables while allowing everyone to hear and enjoy the show too without being interrupted. However, I did have to take a star away for the food. Our waitress was kind and updated us on our food and apologized for the wait, which was very nice of her. The food was mediocre. I'm sure the kitchen was well busy with the amount of orders, but I expected better execution with the atmosphere they provided. The french onion soup was solid and tasty; the veggies skewers had an interesting taste; the portobello mushrooms were a bit heavy on the greasy side and they forgot the ranch sauce, but they had good flavors; and the sweet fries were seasoned very well, but very soggy as if the deep fryer temperature wasn't hot enough and the fries just soaked up the oil. We will be back for the show and I hope they improve on their cuisine. When they do, I will gladly give them 5 stars. :)",Listening Room Cafe,6152593600,30 reviews,2014-12-05,"Nashville, TN",/biz/listening-room-cafe-nashville,4.0,144,"Washington, DC",Natt A.

However the patrons and tourists that happen o stop in don't seem to understand that this is a music venue with food, bot a restaurant with a band.  The sound from the bachelorette parties that aren't listening to the musics and are more interested in ""woohoo"" were jot only rude to the performers, but ALL of the other patrons.  I tried ti talk with the staff and they said they would try to address it with the  servers. One of the singers tried to calm them down as well but it worked for probably 3 min tops. What i would recommend?   Someone with a LRC cafe introduce the artists each night.  As part o that introduction explain that these are songwriters and the venue is about them and celebrating them. In order to so , we ask you keep conversations to a minimum and we may warn you a few times, but if you persist, we may ask you to enjoy the patio outside. Please do this. We will be back. We will bring others. We will try you again, but i it isn't addressed when we return, we simply wont come back.  Update:  (as um un the review when im writing this)They put a powerpoint slide up asking you to min tour conversation.

One time we tried coming in at 11pm because the door was still open and the nba finals were on and they very rudely told us they were closed from the table they were all sitting at chatting. From my experience working you are not closed until you lock the door and if you are you apologize not rudely reject people. Then the next time the manager and girl at the front door were not friendly at all! We didn't realize we needed tickets because the sign was posted on the front door who I was covered by people waiting in line so we waited in line for a long time in the wrong line. And they made it seem like it was our fault. After that I suggested they post the notice about the lines elsewhere where it could be seen and the girl completely ignored me and did not apologize. Also someone in our party asked if they could use the bathroom because we were at the front of the line (the wrong one before they sent us to stand in the correct line) and they refused even when she offered to leave her cell phone at the front desk.

"217 2nd Ave SNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"If I were just basing this on the entertainment and format, I would give this a 5-star rating, but when considering the service and food, it drops to a 3-star.We arrived around 7:30 p.m. not knowing how the showings at this place work. From what I gathered, there are a few ""shows"" each night. They seat for each showing, begin serving, and various musicians play for the next hour and a half to two hours. Our show was set to seat at 8:00 p.m., so the host told us we could either wait 15 minutes or so until the band wrapped up at the bar or outside on their large patio. We opted for outside, since the weather was beautiful. About 15 minutes later I walked over to the door where the host was standing. He commented that the band decided to play a little longer than scheduled. I jokingly said, ""Yeah - likely story,"" to which he responded with attitude that they were ""all just a bunch of music loving hippies around here who don't care much for time anyway."" SCOFF! Just because I got dressed up that night doesn't mean he should assume that I'm not also a music-loving hippie without much care for time! I normally wouldn't be offended at that kind of remark, but it was his tone of voice when he said it that was offensive.Anyway.We went inside soon after this little incident and proceeded to ask him where we should sit, since it seemed there were reservations to consider. He said we could sit at any table where there were no people, so we headed for one near the stage and sat down. He didn't bring us menus, take our drink order or clear our table.About 15 minutes later, our waiter came. He was seemingly confused as to whether we had hung around from the previous show or if we had just been seated. We told him we just sat and he quickly cleared our table. He asked if we were seated there or if we chose it ourselves. We told him the host said to sit where ever we wanted (he said the host was supposed to seat us). He asked if we got menus or a drink order taken yet. We said neither (apparently the host was supposed to do both these things, too). Luckily, he quickly made up for the service the host was lacking. He brought us our two pints and appetizers relatively quickly, was hot on the water refills, and our entrees came not long after our appies.The show was great, too. I loved the format, having so many acts come on along with a host to tie everything together. All the performers did a great job and it was nice to see so much camaraderie among them - they all seemed to know each other and helped one another out during technical difficulties or if someone needed a fill-in percussionist, etc. It was more like a mini festival inside a super awesome music venue.For your NYers: the venue itself reminded me a lot of The City Winery. There are lots of tables and chairs, standing room near the back, and a decent-sized bar area.Despite the holier-than-thou host, I would still come back here for more great up-and-coming musicians and tasty food, too. Get the fried pickles, but don't get the full size - it's pretty much a pound of pickles.",Listening Room Cafe,6152593600,187 reviews,2013-06-30,"Montclair, NJ",/biz/listening-room-cafe-nashville,3.0,144,"Washington, DC",Allie M.

"217 2nd Ave SNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"Went here on a weekday evening. Had decent service (the place was dead) and a good burger. Then went here on a Saturday for brunch. Terrible service. Not only was I ignored half the time, but multiple people came in complaining that hey had been waiting at the front for someone to seat them or something but were never acknowledged.  They advertise bottomless bloody Mary's which were mediocre at best (I wasn't expecting amazing out if bottomless). Biscuits and gravy... Well lets just say I've had better at Denny's. Biscuits were dry and chewy and there wasn't enough gravy even if they were moist and fresh.Music: The weekday night was good. They had a songwriters round that wasn't too bad. Saturday they had a pretty good playlist going but then let some guy walk in off the street and start playing.

"217 2nd Ave SNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"I would KILL to transport the Listening Room back to Honolulu. I made a reservation for $2 online and got a seat right up front by the stage. Worth it? Um...yes! It's not so much the decor that makes Listening Room amazing but it is the sheer amount of musical talent you're able to watch in Nashville which makes it completely worthwhile.I came here twice to watch songwriter rounds during the Tin Pan South Songwriters Festival and was blown away both times. It's amazing to listen to some of my favorite songs of all time (multiple #1 pop and country hits) sung by the people who took part in writing them. It's always been my dream to be a professional songwriter and having these live musical experiences makes it only more of a reality.My tips if you're deciding to watch a show at the Listening Room is to make reservations online. It's really easy and affordable to reserve seating with a full map of the venue. I wouldn't recommend sitting in the very front simply because the speakers are usually turned up pretty loud and you might go deaf. Instead opt for seating which is midway but still has a good view. The Listening Room is small so you can see the stage from pretty much any point in the room. Another tip is to eat somewhere else unless you enjoy bar food. I ate the beet salad one night which was not good at all, but found the chili to be pretty good the second night. Honestly I just don't think I'm cut out for Nashville fare in general because I'm such a picky eater. The food is a bit lackluster but the staff is very accommodating. They always did a good job of checking up on me and making sure I was able to get a fresh drink. You can find street parking but be prepared with a boatload of quarters or park in the pay lot across the street.

"217 2nd Ave SNashville, TN 37201",3.5,We went to this restaurant for a goodbye brunch for 50+ people. The manager was so confused and the wait staff had no clue how many of us were coming in. They do not have any decanters for coffee. One of our organizers even asked if she could help get the coffee to the group she was told they do not have decanters and can only do one cup at a time. Half the group did not get their drinks. When we first walked in I asked the waitress if they have a gluten free option on the buffet the waitress couldn't even tell me what was on it. Once the buffet was empty they did a terrible job refilling it. They provided menus to our group but then told us that we could not order from the menu. So we paid $18 for an empty buffet. On top of that we had to pay a gratuity of 20%.  Also I saw into the kitchen there was only 1 cook working. I asked the manager if she could run my card and she told me she could not that only a server could.  I find this terrible. I hope that the management reaches out to our group to make it right.

"217 2nd Ave SNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"I like this place.  It is a music-oriented bar and restaurant that features bands and musicians who are either recorded or on the cusp of being recorded.  Tables can be reserved online, or one can just show up and take a chance that there are seats.  Unless a well-known artist is playing, there should be tables/seats available.  This is one of the Nashville Originals restaurants which was the reason for my visit.The menu has a variety of American food with a southern touch, including BBQ, fried pickles and green tomatoes, a baked potato selection and more.  My Smoked Pork Steak was hearty and savory and came with house-made chips and a BBQ sauce I used to dip both meat and chips.The service was polite and laid back, like the atmosphere inside this venue.  The music tonight was indie-rock and I've also seen country too.  The mixing could have been a bit better, but the musicianship was very good.Altogether, a place I would come back to and bring friends from out-of-town.",Listening Room Cafe,6152593600,514 reviews,2012-02-10,"Murfreesboro, TN",/biz/listening-room-cafe-nashville,5.0,144,"Washington, DC",Robert S.

"217 2nd Ave SNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"The place is shaped like a handgun.  You enter at the handle, the bar is the trigger enclosure, and the stage and main seating area are the barrel.  You might be wanting a gun after some of the musicians play, but probably not.  There was one song I wanted to take their guitar away from them and shoot it, but was otherwise an ok performance when I went.Something to note if you're wanting to drop in for a quick listen is they have a $10 minimum charge on credit cards, I noticed this at one overpriced drink, but had cash so it was not an issue.There're some spaces across the road in a fenced in parking lot.  The bar has its own spaces assigned if I remember correctly, so you can park in there, one thing to note though is that area is a cage, you go in you have to come back out the same way.  Walking you have to go through there.  I only mention this because a long time ago back when Kaz ran what is now the Living Room a man stood there and pretty much all but said he was planning to rob me.  This was a long time ago though.  You have unrestricted view, so you can tell going in or out if someone is planning on barring your path.If you've never been to a songwriter's night before, this is definitely a good place to go acoustically and seatingwise.  Anywhere in there you'll hear it pretty well.My only real complaint of that night was that although the songs were lyrically well written and interesting, the instrument portion always seemed to go back to ""strum strum strum chord change strum strum strum chord change"", which I understand, these are writers and not performers who have polished the lyrics to perfection, the night came across as ""people who write well-versed songs, can sing competently, but are not rocking the music"" ... like ""here, I wrote these words, let me give them to you in a somewhat repetitive melodic format"" - then again, maybe that's just how it goes.Bathrooms are a bit hard to find if you're at the bar, but just go down the gun barrel, and if it looks like you're going through a kitchen make a left before the black curtain and keep on heading back.I'd spin by and check it out again",Listening Room Cafe,6152593600,573 reviews,2011-01-17,"Nashville, TN",/biz/listening-room-cafe-nashville,3.0,144,"Washington, DC",Paul K.

"217 2nd Ave SNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"A cool room to listen to music indeed!I attended a yelp event at this venue and I have to say I quite liked this place. It has a very open feel to it. I think this is in part because all the windows haven't been blacked out or boarded up, you can actually see outside. Apparently it used be to looong and narrow but the new owner knocked some walls down and I have to say that was a very very good choice indeed. We were treated to some freebies including their Velvet Elvis cocktail, chicken tenders and spinach dip. I wasn't blown away by any of them but they were perfect in the 'bar food' sense and I would definitely order the food here if I were attending a show. If you go to Listening Room this week for Yelp Drinks Week you can get yourself some discounted drinks, so check out their calender and go see a show. One of the girls working the bar was very attentive and friendly the night we were there, so I get the feeling that service is a priority for these folks! Which is a plus at any place.

"217 2nd Ave SNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"The Listening Room is one of my favorite places in town to both play music and listen to music. The sound is great no matter what side of the stage you're sitting on, which you can't say for a good chunk of the venues in town. There is plenty of space to make yourself comfortable and the staff is very friendly and attentive no matter where you are in the room. The food is also pretty good. They at least try to add a little bit of creativity to your standard bar food menu. The only thing is depending on the time of day they might be out of some options, but usually whatever your second option might be is just as good as what you originally had in mind.As far as music goes this is a must stop place in town. The talent is amazing on any given night. If you are from out of town looking to hear great local music, add this to your itinerary(not to mention parking is free and not blocks away!).

"217 2nd Ave SNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"I went there with a group on the grand opening night and was very impressed with the amount of space. Very comfortable as opposed to the downtown scene. However, they were understaffed for opening night! I don't know how this was possible. There was also a very small selection of beers and didn't have the typical brews. The check in offer says one free bud light, something they didn't even have. Even though we didn't order food it was funny to see the reactions of people around us when their food came out as they busted into cheers. One couple just got up and left before their food came out. If they get the staff thing under control and have a elaborate selection of drinks this place would of got my 5 star review but i just don't understand how you can be so ill prepared for a Saturday. The best part of the whole experience was obviously the music. This is by far (with only one visit) my favorite music spot in Nashville.

"2008 Jefferson StNashville, TN 37208",4.0,"We discovered this place by a complete accident.  We were heading towards another destination, when I saw this place.  You couldn't miss the smoke coming out of the smoker.  The prices on the sign were cheap as well.  We were hungry, so we decided we had to try it.  It was around 5:00pm, and they were out of many of their signature items.  I tried to get the gizzards and the shoulder sandwich, but he had already run out.  I settled on the leg quarter, when he said he thought he had one or two left, and the greens.  Then my friend asked what was the best thing, and he said the rib sandwich (which was not on the menu).  He said it was the best on Jefferson St, and probably in Nashville, and that if we didn't like, he would give us whatever we wanted.  Therefore I had to change my order and add that sandwich.  In the end, we ended up with a rib sandwich, which was huge.  There were two pieces of bread laying next to each other and the ribs spanned both slices.  We also had an order of okra, an order of mac n' cheese, two orders of greens.  We also had two leg quarter sandwiches.  This was too much food for two people, even though we finished it off.  And the best part was the price.  The total price for everything was on $12.50.  The ribs were as good as he said.  They had clearly been smoking all day, as all the fat had been rendered into the meat.  The ribs had that beautiful pink smoked color and were fall off the bone.  The leg quarter sandwiches were also delicious and full of that smoked flavor.  The sides were all good, but not as awesome as the meat.  We were unable to eat at the location, which is really just a food truck.  So, be prepared to take it somewhere else.",Mayo’s Mahalia Chicken Outlet,6153291007,432 reviews,2014-05-28,"Memphis, TN",/biz/mayos-mahalia-chicken-outlet-nashville,5.0,7,"Washington, DC",Andy S.

We had to come back again for the homemade pies (offered in peach, apple, and sweet potato); they fry them up for you, and my favorite was the apple one - crispy crust and the filling of diced cinnamon apples - yum!  They are kind of small, so think of a rectangular empanada size.  There's a picnic table off to the side, but most people seem to be coming in for a carry-out or a drive-thru.  Definitely a local and a hidden gem, check them out! :D+ask for Mr. Rasheed :D+Homemade pies (cinnamon apples!!!)+BBQ grilled leg quarter (chicken)+chicken gizzards",Mayo’s Mahalia Chicken Outlet,6153291007,2442 reviews,2014-05-12,"Alexandria, VA",/biz/mayos-mahalia-chicken-outlet-nashville,5.0,7,"Washington, DC",Hannah H.
"2008 Jefferson StNashville, TN 37208",4.0,"I read about Mayo's in WildSam's Nashville travel guide, and it immediately became a ""must-do"" item on our itinerary. My sister and I get a little overenthusiastic about food, so we hurried on over to Mayo's in a panic when we realized they had opened for the day. Keep your eyes peeled - it's a blink-and-you'll-miss-it kind of joint. Unfortunately, Mr. Rasheed (the head chef) told us that they were all out of their famous hand pies, but that the owner would be delivering some more in an hour. We ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich (savory big drumstick served between 2 slices of white bread with pickles) and the gizzards (I didn't go near these, but my sis said they were tasty). We let Mr. Rasheed know that we'd be back later for the pies, and did some more exploring. Well, when we went back, the hand pies still hadn't been delivered - Mr. Rasheed felt bad so he told us to come back after lunch, and that he's make sure he set some pies aside for us, and give them to us free of charge. How nice of him! He stuck true to his word, when we came back later, we were treated to an apple pie and peach pie. The hand pies are long and rectangular in shape, and were piping hot. The apple one was my favorite, but the peach was also really good. We even got to meet the owner, who was very friendly. He got a kick out of the WildSam guide I showed him - he was famous!

"2008 Jefferson StNashville, TN 37208",4.0,"If you compare this humble BBQ shack to most BBQ establishments throughout Nashville, it would probably get about 4 solid stars. But keeping the review relative to the fact that it's a tiny shack with a pretty inefficient drive through (lol), it easily deserves 5 stars.The prices are ridiculously low, but all the meats are cooked on an open flame in an outdoor charcoal grill. Needless to say, the food is great. I suggest calling in ahead and placing your order. Otherwise you'll have to use its odd drive through system. Most drive thrus at restaurants work well because fast food is relatively FAST. Given that most of the items here take about 15-20 minutes to cook upon receiving your order, the drive thru here ends up being a game of shuffling and rearranging the cars.I did not mind waiting though. The scent of burning charcoal while waiting for my food brought back memories of weekly bonfires at the beach in California.The fried okra and french fries could have been crunchier, but both were well seasoned. The grilled chicken was flavorful and juicy ($0.99 per leg quarter!).

Good consistency; not too runny, and the flavor was great! I loved the salsa but it was in a really tiny dish and we had to ask for a lot more of it! I love hot salsa, and this one was pretty hot. If you aren't a fan of heat, this would be too much for you and you should probably ask for a mild salsa. But I loved it!

Our server stopped me from the bathroom and asked where his pens were. I was confused and didn't pay because my BF picked up the tab.

While a little pricier than most mexican restaurants they give you a huge amount of food for what you pay.

"3736 Annex AveNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"There are three kinds of Mexican restaurants: the large chains that are tex-mex (at best); the cookie cutter restaurants; and, finally, restaurants like Tequilas.It has the items you expect from any decent neighborhood Mexican restaurant. But the menu is decidedly different from the run-of-the mill places, with a lot of unique takes on the old standards. There are also things that Tequilas does unique from other restaurants.Finally, one thing that sets a Mexican restaurant apart is its salsa. Tequila's salsa is just spicy enough, with good texture and flavor.",Tequila’s,6153540047,34 reviews,2013-05-05,"Nashville, TN",/biz/tequilas-nashville,4.0,61,"Washington, DC",John W.
"3736 Annex AveNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"In the south there is a term ""Fair to Middlin'"".  I suppose this pretty adequately sums up Tequila's. Once you get past the fact that the seats are very hard and the table and booths seem to be on ice, scooting around despite your best efforts to keep them in place (When I went to leave I almost took the booth out the door with me).Service was good, but the menu warns that each table gets TWO helpings of Chips.  I'm not sure if they are sticklers for this or if its just on there to prevent you from having an ""All You Can Eat Chip Buffet.""The Fried Burritos would appear to be the signature dish, and I was not disappointed in them.  They didn't particularly blow me away, but I found them to be satisfactory.If you are in the mood for a burrito, but really wish it was fried.  This is your stop.",Tequila’s,6153540047,787 reviews,2012-06-22,"Nashville, TN",/biz/tequilas-nashville,3.0,61,"Washington, DC",David O.

"3736 Annex AveNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"Watch out momma you are going to get slapped!... Really, it was that good. So let me tell the story. First, mad props to Yelp.com because this is the first restaurant that i have ever been to solely on the recommendation of this site. It was lunch time today and we were working in bell Meade and we were low on cash. In Richy rich-ville that means your options are limited. So i typed in the filter; cheap, close and good. this was the #1 result that popped up so off we went. I was their first customer of the day and was sat by the kitchen door. I knew i was in for an adventure when I immediately heard all the employees inside the kitchen give out a massive Aztec battle cry to start their shift. Then our waiter instantly appeared with chips and salsa. I was fully prepared to order their $6.00 lunch portion of fajitas when i tasted the salsa. ""WOW, this place may have some real potential"". That is what i thought when i decided to jump into the deep end of the menu and order the $12 palliadia mexicana fajitas. [sorry about spelling there]. It was wonderful. the churizzo was very spicy. the pork was very tender and the carney asada was not overdone. My friend also ordered the fiesta chicken and said it was awesome. I did not taste his food but the presentation was pretty with very festive use of red and green peppers. Our waiter did his job well by giving me at least 5 drink refills plus refills on the chips and salsa. the only negative was the food took 14 minutes to get to the table after we ordered it but i was understanding because they were just opening. Believe me when i say this is a place that i want to go back to with other friends and say ""LOOK WHAT I FOUND""",Tequila’s,6153540047,21 reviews,2011-04-14,"Lebanon, TN",/biz/tequilas-nashville,5.0,61,"Washington, DC",adrian E.
"3736 Annex AveNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"I've been coming to Tequila's now for a year or so, maybe longer. I live very close so I was excited to see a Mexican place that close to home when they opened.I can give a pretty fair review now that I have tried many items on the menu.  Fajitas - they're always good, with good quality meat, tender, juicy and flavorful. My favorite version is the Parillada Mexicana which comes with chorizo, chicken, steak, and shrimp and a carnita, along with the normal grilled veggies.  I will say that sometimes the carnita that comes with this is a bit dry and tough and sometimes the shrimp are overcooked, but overall this is still my favorite fajita dish. (When I say sometimes, I would say out of 7 orders it may have happened twice)The normal carnitas however are always top notch. I think the difference may be that the carnita on the fajita plate gets a bit of extra cooking time being in with the fajita mix and on that hot griddle plate)They also have a spinach burrito dish that is excellent if you're vegetarian. It's creamy and rich with cheese. It comes with two and is great with a guacamole salad. (lettuce, tomato, guac)I also enjoy the fish tacos, they are not fried but grilled and have a nice kick to them. If you want it HOT like I do, you can ask them to cook the fish in the diablo sauce which to me, is still not ""set you on fire"" hot, but others would disagree. I have a pretty high threshold for what most would consider hot.For a different type of lunch I ordered the Huevos Con Chorizo (Eggs with Mexican sausage) which comes with rice and beans, and found it to be great!  Light because of the eggs, but extremely tasty due to the chorizo being scrambled with the eggs.Their guacamole and salsas are always very fresh as well as the chips.Tequila's does a great job of offering the standard Mexican fare those in the US are accustomed to, but also has some items that lean more towards authentic Mexican. The one thing that is missing from the menu (and usually is on most Mexican joints) is a good Mole.  If they could add a good Mole chicken dish, I would be in heaven.  As I've said in previous reviews I'm a bit stingy with stars so very few joints get 5 from me, but Tequilas has always been a solid 4.They have a great and friendly staff, the food is never disappointing, and their prices are very reasonable. You can eat for under $10 easily, or you can get a large meal for between $10.00 and $16.00.If you live in, or are close to West Nashville, it's by far the best Mexican place you can find. And if you're looking for entertainment on the weekends, they do music and karaoke. (or at least they have been)They have a patio you can enjoy and a large back room for larger/private parties.",Tequila’s,6153540047,11 reviews,2011-06-10,"Nashville, TN",/biz/tequilas-nashville,4.0,61,"Washington, DC",Brian N.

"3736 Annex AveNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"I've spent a lot of time on Yelp talking about the glories of ""authentic Mexican"" food, which is actually readily available in Nashville. Of course, there's plenty of TexMex and Americanized Mexican food available in Nashville too, and I happen to think that's a good thing. Sometimes you just want to eat something that's slathered in cheese sauce, am I right? U.S. Border Cantina used to be our go-to spot for Mexican food when I was craving queso and margaritas, but now that it's gone to the restaurant graveyard in the sky, Tequila's is our new haunt when we're in the mood for Meximerican (a term of my own creation) food. I think most of these ""Mexican"" restaurants are pretty interchangeable, but Tequila's food is legitimately very tasty (the fajita burrito is enough for two, though it's so yummy you won't want to share) and has lightning fast service. Additionally, while it doesn't serve the best margaritas I've ever had, it does offer up decent incarnations of them, and for a reasonable price, too. For $6.50, you can get a top-shelf marg that will seriously rev your engine. Better yet, they have plenty of drink specials, including $15 margarita pitchers on the weekend (and they're even cheaper during the week), which makes getting your tequila fix all the easier.So not authentic by any means, but still good in its own right.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Wow, I absolutely am a fan of the Rose Pepper and would recommend it to anyone in the Nashville area to give it a try. They automatically start you off with chips and three different kinds of salsa. I had the Fajita burrito, but we definitely would recommend substituting in their marinated steak and adding the grilled jalapeños to make it caliente! It's definitely good sized portions too. Also, we ordered a pitcher of the house margarita. It lasted the whole meal and it was delicious. Additionally it was pretty packed when we arrived but they accommodated us with our request to sit outside very quickly.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I have only heard amazing things about Rosepepper and I do always love what they have posted on the marquee. We have lived here for 9 months and for whatever reason, we just went for the first time last night. It was raining outside, but the hostess was able to immediately seat us on the covered patio at 6pm on a Friday. Since everyone raves about the margs, my husband and I split a pitcher of the house version. Sadly the happy hour prices were not offered but I think these were like $24.50 (50¢ added for fresh limes). They were really good and not from a pre-made mix. And nice n' strong. The chips are accompanied by a trio of salsas that were all good. My husband's dish came with guacamole on the side and it was very good as well. I'm really picky about guac. It's either too ripe and I can't eat it or it's fresh and I can't stop. I didn't stop until his was gone. I also liked that the condiments were served in tiny fried tortilla bowls. Ate most of that too. I opted for the grilled fish tacos (duh) and husband ordered the veggie burrito. Fish tacos were alright but sadly they just use bagged corn tortillas and don't make their own. Halfway through the second taco, I had to eat with a fork because it was falling apart. I really liked their beans. Rice was really bland so I didn't eat more than a bite or two. Husband said his burrito was good but kind of bland and not great. All in all, I wasn't super impressed with most of the food, but some of it was really good. I will probably go back for happy hour margaritas and to try something else on the menu.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I came here for my best friend's birthday dinner and was pleasantly surprised by what a cute place it was. I feel like in Nashville you come across a lot of cookie cutter Mexican restaurants (Las Palmas, Nachos, etc.) But Rosepepper is different. They office am ambiance like none other and a non traditional menu.So I am all about the cocktails, so I'll start with those! I ordered a sugar cane mojito. It was the best mojito I have ever had! Plus it came with a stick of sugar cane in it, which was fun for the whole family to try. Then I had a mango margarita. It was a little sweeter than I expected, but was overall a delicious drink. My friend had the traditional marg, which has one several ""Nashville Awards"". I took a sip and it was wonderful. If I was just rating this place on cocktails, I would give it 5 stars.So the two years of my life that I didn't live in Nash, I was going to school in dallas. During that time I fell in love with street tacos. I have been looking for a place with great street tacos in Nashville, and finally found some here! They were absolutely delicious! They came with rice and beans, which were just mediocre.

Think thick cut slices of avacado deep fried in a nice light but crunchy clean fry (meaning didn't taste like all the other fried food, someone cleaned the fryer oil) my entree was the Carne Asada burrito that comes with onions, tomatos and  delicious steak, not traditional but very good, get the spicy green sause on the side and thank me later.

I ordered huevos rancheros. I totally understand that everyone makes them different, but these were not good.  I asked for a fried egg, completely cooked. When I got my food, my egg was running all over the plate. I hate sending back my food, and I usually just eat the food. I couldn't do that with this egg. She brought another plate out. It was just right. I will just be honest and say that it was not enjoyable at all. The pieces of the meal were good separately but all together was pushing it. I really liked the eggs and potatoes. I kinda just ate it because I hadn't eaten. I was happy she didn't charge us for the meal. It made the situation a little better even though I had my heart set on a really good meal. We ate outside under their tented area. They had fans blowing but it was still kinda hot. I know I know... It's TN in the summer so it's expected. I'm not sure if it's where they seated us but there were a ton on flies. Again I know summer time in the south, it comes with the territory. I'm mentioning this because no one else sitting outside had to fan their food constantly. I was overall disappointed because my last experience was way better.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"You'd get a better food quality with cheaper drinks and a much shorter wait time nearby at Five Points Cocina.This is Mexican fusion done fairly well. The food is good, but definitely not worth waiting 45 minutes or more. Most people rave about the specialty margaritas here, for which I grant Rosepepper their due credit. Again, though, not worth the 45 min+ wait for an overpriced, overly designed margarita.There are some great dishes at Rosepepper, especially since it is one of few places in Nashville that serve mole. But you can get great mole at Las Fiestas, too, up the street on Gallatin at a fraction of the wait time and cost.The patio seating at Rosepepper is pretty cool, especially since it is covered and quite extensive in size.

I was expecting peppers and other Mexican kinda stuff. Nope. Cauliflower, carrots, broccoli. All of which obviously came pre chopped and frozen. It was the grossest thing I have ever put in my mouth. Pretty sure the veggies were freezer burned. My girlfriend tried to order the flan today. The waitress got a disgusted look on her face and said ""Don't do it.""Now I am here currently drinking. I went to Las Maracas prior for food, as I refuse to eat the gross food here. We are sitting at the bar and I am looking at the wall behind the bar.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I've been to Rosepepper a few times now. I like the atmosphere but I hate the wait. This most recent time it took about an hour to get seated on a Friday night. We finally got seated on the patio section. The patio section is a large wooden deck with a wooden fence around it. It's nice to be outside but it's like a wooden box. Our server was fast & friendly. We ordered the fried avocado fries as an appetizer. It's not on the menu but they're great. We skimmed the drink menu & decided on getting the casa margarita, pitcher for $33 for the 3 of us. The margarita was good, but I don't think it was $33 a pitcher good. Maybe 20 bucks. We drank it all & enjoyed it though. I wouldn't say it's the best margarita in town. The chips & salsa are pretty good. You're given a 3 sampler with the salsa. One is a Verde type salsa. The next is your average tomato based salsa and last is the HOT salsa, that was my favorite. For my dinner, I decided on the Rosepepper special in the enchiladas. It's listed as VERY SPICY. I like spicy food, so I thought it was just kind of spicy. I wouldn't say it's very spicy. The beans were your average Mexican beans with cheese on top. I enjoyed the beans more than the rice. The rice had peas & carrots in it. It didn't taste like your normal Mexican rice. My boyfriend got the fajitas which were 15 bucks. I'm not sure why they were so expensive.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"The main thing you should know about Rosepepper: best (strongest) margaritas in Nashville. Also, their food is incredible. I've been to Rosepepper several times since I moved to Nashville in 2012, but my culinary experience tonight warranted a review, and a favorable one at that. First off, get a margarita. Don't let your friends talk you into getting a Corona or, god forbid, a Miller Lite. Get a margarita. Their house margarita is excellent, and the specialty margaritas are quite good, as well (I'm a bit partial to the Jala-piña-rita (jalapeño-infused tequila)). They're always made fresh to order, and *clear* (i.e, made with tequila and lime juice, not margarita mix). Trust me, don't miss out on this. That would be like failing to vote or going to Wal-Mart on purpose or eating McDonald's right after eating McDonalds. Don't be that kind of human.Next, get the homemade guacamole. Don't ask any other questions, just get it. It's fresh, it's spicy, it's delicious, and it comes with fried tortilla chips (like regular chips, but fried (aka better)). Combine this with the margaritas you just ordered and the complimentary salsa trio, and you're well on your way to a good time (which I hope you're sharing with others; if you're by yourself, call me and I'll come meet you). Now, the food is where I leave you to your own devices. People like what they like and I'm not here to be the Ghandi to your search for meaning. I'll just tell you what I like. The mole carnitas. Houston, I repeat, the mole carnitas. The holy mole carnitas. Let me break it down for you like this: steaming, pull-apart pork, perfectly seasoned, alongside pico de gallo and avocado; to the side is rice and black beans; in the aluminum foil are your piping hot corn tortillas (i.e., heaven). In a little cup on your plate is the mole sauce. And it's not like mole you've had before. No chocolate wanna-be's here. This is delectably spicy *pecan* mole sauce. It has a superb balance of nuttiness, heat, and depth that make you want to tilt your overwhelmed head back and drink it. I think world leaders are bathed in this stuff as children. When I tasted it, my wife told me my eyes closed and I went to my little food heaven for a minute. Am I exaggerating? Would I use a word like ""superb"" or ""delectably"" if I was? See? I answered your question with a question. Call me Socrates. Hopefully you still have some of your margarita (or second one) left to wash these homemade carnitas tacos down. When I first tasted the multi-layered goodness of tortilla, black bean, carnitas, pico, avocado, and mole, I had to take a (figurative) step back and contemplate my life. After that, I relished each bite. And when you realize that your whole meal was only $24 (margarita + dinner + 1/2 guacamole), then it's even more worth it. I think I actually sang ""Baby You're Worth It"" to my plate of food (and much to my wife's chagrin). So, take my advice, or don't. But here, that's like saying ""buy health insurance, or don't,"" or ""marry the girl of your dreams, or don't."" Anyway, you get the picture. Go forth and enjoy.

However, on account of the horrendous service, the food was spoiled by the pure lack of respect for paying customers. We called ahead to make reservations and were told they don't take reservations. When we arrived, we had to wait over an hour for a table (we were the first on the list). We had a party of 8, so I understood having to wait for a larger table to open up. About 45 minutes after our arrival, a party of 7 was seated before us, having just arrived. We asked why and they said that the party of 7 had made reservations. What?!When we were finally seated, the manager came out to seat us... at two completely separate tables.Once seated, I thought the wait would be over. I was wrong. We finally ordered about 20 minutes after being seated and I asked for extra silverware as there wasn't enough at the table.Yet another 20-25 minutes pass and finally everyone's food arrives.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I have been here twice, and will continue to go here. now that that's out of the way I will review:Atmosphere: fun and great decor. Love every unique item. Food: Decent and standard Mexican fare. Las Maracas is actually great tex-mex at a cheaper price. They do have unique menu items though. Plus they are locally owned so I would always support them because of that. Loved their 3 salsas. All of them are very good. The green one is my favorite. Be warned, one of the red ones is hella hot though. Drinks: They use actual real fruit in their drinks. The margarita is 10$ and its worth it. Service: waitstaff were fine and service was fine. However the management tent to have a light dusting of asshole-ism when it comes to seating. They did accommodate our large party well, but they made it seem like it was a big inconvenience for them. When you are in the restaurant business and you almost sigh when we say how many people are going to be joining us. You are in the business of making money, no? You are going to have 13 people sitting down at your restaurant, each with an entree, and one of those delicious 10$ margaritas. Does the idea of making money not interest you?Anyway.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I give this rate due to the terrible service, especially that offered by the front desk servers. We had a group of 8. After asking how many people we have, they just put us waiting and served the smaller groups coming behind us. They refused to tell us what we were waiting for by ignoring our inquiries. Are larger groups paying less for the food?? If it's not the case that all restaurants nearby were full, I would definitely not stay. Besides, there is a strong smell of toilets welcoming you once you step into the hall. The food is nothing special to talk about. I was surprised that they enforced a 20% tip on the final bill.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"""I like my salsa like I like my men - HOT""This is what the marquee outside Rosepepper said as we walked by. We hadn't intended to eat here, it wasn't even our second choice, but I forgot to confirm if our first choice (Silly Goose) was open on Sundays (twas not) and here we ended up.The interior is what some might call kitschy, others might call it tacky. The large room is cobbled together into odd little sections. Christmas tree lights, sheer panel curtains (or shower curtains) adorned with purple lights, and chandeliers are hung haphazardly. The outdoor patio, however, is quite great - large and equipped with fans and heaters to handle all sorts of weather. We only opted to sit on the patio because of said fans (it was hotter than balls); as promised, they kept the place pretty breezy.We were brought a bowl of chips and three salsas to start. The chips were good, homemade I believe. I'm not sure who penned the marquee, but if they truly think those salsas are hot, we have vastly different taste in men. Hot they were not; two were incredibly mild and one just barely passable for medium. If they were men, they'd be those nondescript, forgettable types.For our lunch, he ordered steak tacos with a side of the spicy salsa verde and I ordered the del mar (white fish) enchiladas with their special spicy salsa verde. I should have known better, there's a reason you don't see fish (shrimp maybe, but not fish) enchiladas on menus. I do not recommend these; they're not inedible, but the salsa softening the tortillas on top of white fish being so flalky made the thing a mushy mess. The special salsa, though, was pretty good. The only oddity was that the side my companion got was served warm (as in heated). Bottom line: There's probably a reason the vegetarian place across the street had a steady wait and we walked right into Rosepepper.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"We live very close to Rose Pepper and have enjoyed going the past few years.  If guests or friends want some good Mexican, we go here. If we want good margaritas, we go here, if we want black beans, we go here.  We loved this place and went for the last time last Thursday.  We had friends in town and the four of us wanted Mexican and margaritas.  There was a ""wait"" and we ordered a pitcher of margaritas to pass the time.  We tried to drink them on the side patio but we were told that section lost it's liquor license so we had to drink them inside.  No biggie but we did notice lots of open tables inside and outside (which is where we wanted to sit) and thought it odd there was a wait.We got to our table and ordered cheese dip and it was brought and we enjoyed it with our drinks and started to wonder where our waitress was to order.  The pitcher became empty, our chips ran out, the cheese dip was half gone.... no waitress.... we tried to flag down another waiter who was helping THE TABLE BEHIND us and he looked at us and said, ""No.""  We were stunned.  I was embarrassed that we had brought people from out of town to one of our favorite weekly Mexican fix places.  NO?!!!  No you cannot help us?  No you cannot find our waitress?  NO?!  What kind of business are you in?!  Needless to say, I was pissed, we finally ordered our food, our waitress brought us the wrong type of margarita for the second pitcher and we ate our food and left.  Don't bother going here.  Some might say, ""this only happened once!"" but for us, the rudeness is a total deal breaker.  They weren't busy and there is no excuse to not help guests find a waitress.  I will be writing a letter to the establishment.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I don't like really spicy food, so it's weird when I say food is bland. All of the food was nicely done, but a skillful addition of spices could knock it out of the ballpark. While the chicken flautas were well prepared, chicken breast is naturally bland and dry. They really could use some cheese, onions -- anything to give it a kick and a little moisture. The chimichanga had beef that was tender and a little tastier. I found myself pouring queso and salsa over everything to bump up the taste. Refried beans were good, rice was tasteless, but the three salsas were good, chips were adequate. The atmosphere was fantastic. We were seated fairly promptly, and service by Hannah was attentive and pleasant. The total for two lunch entrees, a side of queso dip, one soda, tax, and tip was $20, which was a great deal for what we got. You also could spend a lot more here.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Rosepepper seems to have really gone downhill in recent years.I used to enjoy the eclectic decor and warm ambience. On my most recent visit, I was struck by a stale energy and musty smell.Nowadays, the employees, from hostesses to servers, seem burned out and to have lost their collective charm. The bartenders still seem friendly, though.Menu-wise, even their trio of complimentary salsas isn't as good as it used to be. The salsas were bland, lacking seasoning. I ordered the ""buffalo white cheese dip"" (i.e. chori queso) which came with maybe a teaspoon of rendered chorizo crumbles on the top. I felt ripped off.In my opinion, there are only two things worth ordering here:1.) For drinks, the skinny margarita (i.e. a real margarita, made with tequila, fresh lime juice, and triple sec). At $9 for a pint (YES, a pint) on the rocks, I found this to be both delicious and a good deal.2.) For food, the chile verde. Their very spicy pork green chile stew is served in a bowl, accompanied with rice, refried beans, a charred jalapeño, and (average) flour tortillas. This hearty bowl of spicy comfort food will do the trick when you're not feeling well.Knowing exactly what I like here and considering only the margarita and chile verde, I'd be more inclined to give 3 stars (probably 4 back in the day).

The salsa sampler and chips are good for free chips. The guacamole appetizer is a generous portion. The avocado fries are a little bland but with the dip they've got a little kick. The enchilada and tacos were fairly unmemorable. The margarita came out looking pretty clear, no fake green dye here.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Not sure what all the fuss is. We wound up there because every other place we wanted to go to had a wait and this place did not (red flag #1). The outdoor seating is rather nice and the service is good. But the food was average at best. The chips, salsa and guac were a 7 out of 10. But I had a burrito and my husband had tacos of some sort that I remember thinking I could have made better at home.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I've had pretty good experiences with Rosepepper up until tonight. I called in an order to be picked up - I ordered the Enchiladas and the tacos (on their menu I think it's called ""Los Originales""). When I ordered the tacos, the woman taking my order asked ""Just one?"" which I answered ""yes,"" assuming she meant just one order. I guess she took that to mean I just wanted one taco with nothing else. I get the food home and see the lonely taco in the box. So I call them back, explain what happened, and get met with some weird attitude. Like I was an idiot for not spelling out that when I said ""The beef tacos,"" I meant that I wanted the food that's actually listed on their menu. She put me on hold for awhile while asking her manager if they could fix the order. When she got back on the line, she apologized and said that we could come back and pick up the rice and beans. When I asked, ""And the other taco?"" she said, ""Oh....you wanted two tacos?""I was very tempted to ask her to actually pick up one of the menus, flip to the ""taco"" section and ask her to read the ONLY THREE OPTIONS. Not one of those options is ""Single taco with literally nothing else."" Normally I would give this place 4 stars, my husband and I eat here a lot. But this was really weird. I hope they're damn good tacos, considering it will now have taken hours to get them.",Rosepepper Mexican Grill,6152274777,12 reviews,2014-07-24,"Downtown, Nashville, TN",/biz/rosepepper-mexican-grill-nashville,2.0,373,"Washington, DC",Molly M.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"My boyfriend and I had been looking for an excuse to go to RosePepper for a while. When my mom came to town and expressed her interest in having Mexican, we decided to finally take the leap. My mother and I got to the restaurant around 6:30 and were promptly seated and greeted by Shane (who was fantastic - very pleasant and accommodating). He got us set up with some margaritas (and even carded my 57 year old mom - made her extremely giddy!). The chorizo queso was great as well. My boyfriend showed up a little after 7 - it took us 10 or so minutes to order, followed by 40 minutes to receive our food - however, previously being a server, I have to say - NONE of it was our waiter's fault. Even though it was a Monday night, it was extremely busy, and it seemed every server had 7-8 tables at the very least. The food was worth the wait, and I was fine after I got some food in me, but when I come back it will probably only be for appetizers and margaritas with some girlfriends.",Rosepepper Mexican Grill,6152274777,11 reviews,2014-07-22,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rosepepper-mexican-grill-nashville,4.0,373,"Washington, DC",Nicole F.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"We were visiting Nashville and our relatives had heard great things about Rosepepper, so they took us there.  It was SO disappointing.  The wait was about 45 minutes. When we finally got called in, the hostess was pleasant and the service was good. But the food was hugely disappointing.The best thing served was the tomatillo salsa.  Great flavor and not too hot for this hot pepper lightweight.  But nothing else was worth coming back for.  I had their spinach enchiladas.  When I cut into the enchilada a huge amount of grease spilled out. It looked like they had cooked the spinach in a vat of oil.  The beans and rice served with the enchilada were adequate, but not spectacular.  My husband had some kind of beef burrito.  The meat was flavorful but dry.  The burrito was filled with nothing but the meat, so it was a very dry burrito overall.  We are used to eating burritos bursting with flavor and goodies.  But not here.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I wouldn't file Rosepepper under ""Amazing"" but certainly it's really, really good. Their menu is a little more experimental than your average Mexican joint (avocado fries, etc.) and their drinks are on point. An entire page of the menu is devoted to varieties of tequila- sorted by shelf/price range. Mojitos, mezcal, and margaritas: yum. I like trying different drinks every time I'm here and the bartender can be a big help in selecting a tequila right for you. Back to the food. I usually get a burrito, which is as big as a football, so it's easily enough for two people. I always forget that their courtesy chips & salsa comes with three kinds of salsa, which is awesome. You get mild, medium, and tomatillo salsa bowls. Their guac is also good, which is crucial to me. I like their patio which is heated and got a recent makeover. Service is always great too. I guess my only complaint is that sometimes the dishes aren't as good as I know they've been. They're not 100% consistent in taste. But this is true of most places.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I've had mixed experiences with the food at Rosepepper, but the margaritas bring it up to a solid 4 stars. Love me some top shelf margaritas!!I really like that they give you 3 different salsas varieties and are eager to replenish the bowls once they are depleted. I also tried their cheese dip on my last visit, and it was tasty. They don't fancy it up like some restaurants, this one is just the good white cheese dip you get at a Mexican place.Their food prices are on the higher end for Mexican food, and has been hit or miss for me. I've tried the burritos with limited satisfaction, and have had a similar experience with the enchiladas. Overall their food lacks a lot of flavor. I finally ordered something delicious, the chicken fajitas. For $14 I expected it to be a large portion, and it was.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I really enjoyed visiting RosePepper on a recent trip to Nashville. Being a Texan, it's hard to find good Tex-Mex and even harder to find good Mexican food while traveling. When a family member suggested RosePepper I knew I had to check it out. We arrived around noon on a Saturday and we were seated immediately. For lunch the restaurant was a little dark but once my eyes adjusted I was navigating to the back half of their menu--the margaritas. My wife and I are suckers for a good margarita. I ordered the Jalepano Pineapple Margarita and it was great. My wife ordered the house margarita and I was surprised by the sweetness of her drink. It was a refreshing change from the artificially enhanced sweet and sour mix that most places use, but still too sweet for my taste. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and loved the flavor as well as the amount of meat.

But the most recent trip was worth writing about. We had an 8 top, and the restaurant was slammed on a Thursday night. I'm not going to drone on, but the service was AWEFUL, rude, and bitchy. Not worth listing the details. There's a difference between being in the weeds, and simply not giving a damn about your table. I have a theory. She ended up adding 20% gratuity to the check so I'm thinking she didn't give a hoot. Then there was the food. I had some kind of tilapia steamed on a banana wrap. The amount of fish was absolutely ridiculous for $14, and I had to smoother it in hot sauce to make it edible.

It was beyond clear that cheese dip was all over me but none of the wait staff even stopped. I had to go behind the bar myself grab napkins and then wipe down in front of the hostess stand.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"we had a group of 7 and promptly seated! waitress was very laid back because we had to wait for our other guest to arrive and no pressure! finally ordered and food was quickly ready - I had a small chicken quesadilla, not that impressive, kinda dry and way cheesy - the guacamole and sour cream served on the side helped though. decor was for sure eclectic (which I love) but kinda looked thrift store picked and thrown on the walls and ceiling! I will go back but for sure try something different to eat! and just a warning- there is one bathroom for the entire restaurant- so be ready for a line at the door! blah haha",Rosepepper Mexican Grill,6152274777,12 reviews,2014-11-30,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rosepepper-mexican-grill-nashville,3.0,373,"Washington, DC",Jordan C.

We split a pitcher between 3 of us and for the price, it was definitely worth it. I like that they bring you three salsas with your chips because I'm a salsa fiend. I don't love that they charge you more for another round, but I suppose it keeps me from eating my weight in chips before my actual food arrives. We also tried the avocado fries which were okay. I'm not a huge fried food fan, but my husband liked them.I split the chicken fajitas with a friend. Pretty standard, but I loved that the veggies were still a bit crisp.

Food: pretty standard Mexican (fusion) fare, and it was good. I had the Sonora enchiladas, which were nice and spicy as promised, and very tasty. Everyone in the group seemed happy with the food and drink. Service was fine.

At the time, we were all out of drinks, done with food, and were trying to get out of there to go somewhere else. I understand things get busy, but to just leave a table sitting there for a solid hour with not even so much as a glance is very frustrating. Also, when we finally got the check? There was an additional 50 cent charge for fresh lime juice on everyone's margaritas. Really? If I would have known I would have requested to leave that off....so...I get a 9 dollar marg AND you charge me extra for lime juice?! Finally, after we talked to a couple of people they refunded us our money for the lime juice, which I think is the least they could do for making us wait so long for our check.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"1) Service has gone downhill sadly. It use to be a hotspot for my staff to enjoy a mexican fiesta... or just lunch, but after the last couple visits -- i'll be shocked if we return. 2) Who charges for chips and salsa? I could understand requiring a minimum order ($10 or something) -- but after one small container of chips and a vat of salsa, any table of two or more is usually wanting more (and will typically spend $50+ on a meal + drinks).  Just a disappointing move. 3) Yeah the mexican is ... sloppier, but I will find myself as Las Maracas from now on.",Rosepepper Mexican Grill,6152274777,15 reviews,2013-05-22,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rosepepper-mexican-grill-nashville,2.0,373,"Washington, DC",Phil C.
"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,I do not like this place.  I've tried for years but no.I brought some out of town girlfriends here today after they had asked about Rosepepper.  I figured I would take one for the team and let them try it out.  UGHService was beyond horrible and to top it off it took 15 minutes from when when asked for our check and when the server dropped it off and there were maybe 8 tables in the entire restaurant.  We had somewhere to be so that was pretty annoying.  The food - no.  Salsa has potential but stop watering it down.  Margaritas are fine - that's why I didn't give 1 star.I asked for a side of guacamole and it comes in a cute little fried tortilla bowl.  The server brings it out in her hands and just lays it on the table.  No plate. Are you serious?I was embarrassed but the food and service were both so bad we were still laughing about it later in the day.  Never again.,Rosepepper Mexican Grill,6152274777,129 reviews,2013-04-20,"San Francisco, CA",/biz/rosepepper-mexican-grill-nashville,2.0,373,"Washington, DC",Samantha S.

Given I wasn't very hungry after already having lunch at an awesome place in downtown Nashville, but when we came down to see Jenny's ice cream from recommendations, we were looking forward to a small appetizer style dinner here before ice cream. Unfortunately we were disappointed by the food. Don't advertise tempura fried avocado then serve deep fried battered version of it. Tempura should be light, crispy, high temp fried food that keeps the flavor of what it's coating intact. These were heavy and way over batted and just nasty. Had 2 pieces.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I my quest to find great Mexican food in Nashville I was prompted to try Rosepepper's Mexican food in (East) Nashville; their margaritas are reputed to be the best in Nashville.After eating there yesterday afternoon I hate to say disappointment again. First off they sat us on the patio, with was cold but we stuck it out (no patio heaters???) We ordered margaritas, which was the clearest I'd ever seen anywhere and about as flavorful as water with a twist of lime. The menu labels some dishes as ""muy cailente"", but my entree night was bland. If you serve a taco in a corn tortilla you need to use two, if not they just fall apart.The service was good, though.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"So - I have written this review a couple times.  I have gone back and changed the review more than once because I can't seem to express what I want to say, really.Perhaps just stating it as plainly as I can will help.  So, here we go:  Not at all impressed.I visited Rosepepper several times years ago.  I hadn't visited in a while and my group of friends and I were originally going to go to the Silly Goose across the street.  However, they couldn't fit us in until 9pm.  So, instead of waiting - we decided to go to Rosepepper and see if we could get in.  I didn't think we could because, in my previous experiences, it was hard to get a seat at Rosepepper.  They had no problem seating 10 of us immediately.  Great!  So, we were seated on the patio.  And, they put us at a table that really shouldn't have seated more than 8 - but, that's OK.  We made it work.We place our drink order and, for some unknown reason, it took forever for them to come out.  And no one ordered anything alcoholic.  We all have a discussion about how odd it was that there was a sticker on the front of the menu telling us that they are now going to charge for more than 1 bowl of Chips and/or salsa.  They brought 2 bowls for 10 of us.  The bowls were small.  This seemed a little 'nickel and dime' to me.  I can't remember being charged for chips at a Mexican restaurant.  Sure, they will charge for queso or guacamole.  But never chips.  Very nickel and dime to me - especially considering that there are plenty of Mexican restaurants in the Nashville area and none of them charge for chips and salsa.  Then we finally ordered dinner - and it took forever for everything to come out.  And, when it did - everything I had was cold.  The beans, the rice and the Chimichanga were cold.  And the cheese sauce over the Chimi was congealed meaning that there is no doubt it had been sitting for a while.  During the meal - our table was FULL of glasses, plates, empty salsa cups and chip bowls.  Not once did the server remove any plates or empty glasses.  We all finally just decided to put the stuff on the floor because we didn't have room for anything else.  All of this left me wondering if the owners of Rosepepper are having money issues or some sort of business issues or something.  I mean - in previous encounters at Rosepepper it was hard to get a seat and this time - no problem.  Nickel and dime on refills of chips and salsa and the inability to get the food out in a timely manner and the server not clearing anything - this might mean they are short staffed or can't keep help for whatever reason.  It was all very disconcerting.  I don't think I'll be back.  Usually - at a restaurant - even if everything doesn't go well - if I can find a reason to come back (food or service) I will come back.  But, the service was lack luster from beginning to end and the food was mediocre in flavor - and was cold when we got it (another service issue).  Even if the food was warm (or even hot) the flavor was the same.  It was very bland.  Wish I could have given a good review for Rosepepper.  If the food had been good, I could have excused the service.  Next time I might get a different server but I would expect food as good as my previous trip.If the service had been good, I could have excused the food.  Maybe it was an off night in the kitchen.  Maybe next time the food will be better - but at least they had great service.I honestly couldn't say there was anything that made me want to come back - and that makes me sad.",Rosepepper Mexican Grill,6152274777,86 reviews,2013-06-10,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rosepepper-mexican-grill-nashville,2.0,373,"Washington, DC",Joshua B.
"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Okay, after three not-so-great experiences here, I'm writing a review:Bad Experience #1: It was last summer, and it was hot. The air-conditioning/electricity went out before we had even gotten our meal. I get it - we did have a very hot summer in Nashville last summer and the A/C was being overworked. It was still a bad experience and I never want to sweat that much in a Mexican restaurant again. Bad Experience #2: I was there in the evening for a small birthday party. Dinner was over, we were leaving. It was around 8pm. A girl (who I didn't know) threw up all over my back and the floor as I was exiting the building - not the restaurant's fault, but still a bad experience none-the-less. I never want to be thrown up on in a Mexican restaurant again.Bad Experience #3: Again, here for a friend's birthday dinner earlier this month. Our party was for 16, though originally when the reservation was made it was 14, so we upped the numbers (by two) and let them know. We waited an hour and a half to be seated (no biggie - we had a big party, we understood). So finally they were ready to seat us. There were two seats missing, so my boyfriend and I asked for two more seats. The host was a little short with us, asked us if we had let them know that it was supposed to be 16 and not 14 - we said yes (because, yes, we did let them know). She made zero effort to find a small table to add to the end and told us that we had to sit on the corners as she handed us chairs. Basically we ate our food in our laps. And, I would also like to add that the bathrooms were not clean (messes on the floor - it was just gross.)The food - not memorable. If the food was amazing I'd probably forgive my bad experiences because really, after writing this all out, it looks like I've just had extremely bad luck at this place. I'm a believer in second chances but the third time is the charm - Bad Experience #3 was the icing on the cake and I'll probably not be going out of my way to come back.",Rosepepper Mexican Grill,6152274777,21 reviews,2013-03-06,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rosepepper-mexican-grill-nashville,2.0,373,"Washington, DC",Kate A.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I went to Rosepepper for the 2nd time last week, and I'll be honest...I don't want to like this place for a number of reasons:1. It's trendy -  New trendy places tend to lose their appeal once all the new shininess has warn off and people start judging them on their food and service.2. It's full of hipsters and folks of that ilk - I'm probably showing my age, and maybe I'm just hatin' for the sake of hatin', but some hipsters really get under my skin. 3. There's always a long wait to get seated - refer back to reason #1.Despite these reasons, I can't help myself; I like Rosepepper. I have had margaritas on both occasions, and being a former bartender, I must say they are quite excellent. They are exactly how I would make a margarita for myself; heavy-handed on the tequila, a splash of Cointreau, and fresh-squeezed lime juice. Darn near close to perfect. The food is also not too shabby. The Sonora Style Enchiladas are out-of-this-world tasty with some crazy-good spicy flavor. I would also recommend the Chile Verde which also has quite a nice kick to it. I wasn't expecting it to be quite so soupy, but it worked really well considering it was very cold outside and we were eating on the back patio area. Speaking of the patio area...I liked eating out there. It wasn't as loud as the rest of the restaurant, it felt more private, and think it would be a cool place to hang out at night in the summer.Bottom Line: Go there, but if you hate waiting in line, then you may want to consider going for lunch. 4 Stars.",Rosepepper Mexican Grill,6152274777,37 reviews,2013-03-06,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rosepepper-mexican-grill-nashville,4.0,373,"Washington, DC",Robert B.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Let me say, up front, that the food here is fantastic. Keep that in mind through the rest of my review, because it's probably going to sound more negative than it should.This is not a typical Mexican restaurant, by any means. In East Nashville fashion, Rosepepper emphasizes trendiness, which results in higher prices and a small hint of pretentiousness. This is most apparent by the sticker that graces the front of every menu:""Your first round of chips and salsa is on us. Refills: Chips $2.00 Salsa $1.00 ea."" Call me old fashioned, but that's the ONE thing that a Mexican restaurant can do to annoy me. I've put up with bad service at plenty of them. But to charge for extra chips and salsa borders on absurdity. Oh, and the sticker has a big, condescending smiley face on there, as if that makes it okay.The service was actually pretty good. Not super attentive, and our margaritas took a while to come out, but nothing was particularly bad. The food all came out right and relatively quickly, each of which is a minor miracle at many Mexican restaurants. But like I said, the food was great. Overprice, sure, but delicious, nonetheless. I don't mind paying extra for good food, but is this really twice as good as any of the places on Nolensville? Fancier, sure; better, no. The margaritas, however, were noticeably better than most - something that's actually worth the price increase. And despite my frustration with them, the chips and salsa were great. But I'm not going to pay $2 for more chips, solely on principle.Rosepepper is a good, though overhyped, restaurant. It certainly delivers some great food, but it's hard to justify the tradeoffs.",Rosepepper Mexican Grill,6152274777,47 reviews,2013-07-26,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rosepepper-mexican-grill-nashville,3.0,373,"Washington, DC",Ozro D.

It tasted fine, guess I would call it good but nothing exceptional.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I've been here several times and every single time I leave wondering why I gave them another chance only to be severely disappointed.The only redeeming factor of my experiences has been the margaritas. If you're looking for a good magarita and absolutely nothing else, this is a fantastic spot to drink a few down and munch on some chips. I think one of their salsas in the trio are actually yummy, but 1/3 isn't great.I've ordered several different items from this restaurant, and have always been less than happy with my dishes. The chicken is always dry and poorly seasoned. The raw vegetables on the side are completely unnecessary because they're bland and not even incorporated into the dish. The rice has absolutely zero flavor and I am confident I could make it better at home.The only good food I've had here in maybe 6 different visits has been the carnitas (off my brother's plate after I decided I didn't want my food) and the guacomole (which is admittedly delicious and chunky and comes with great tostadas). Even these good items wouldn't bring me back to this place because not only has the food not been good consistently but the service has also been dismal on several times.One instance in recent memory happened back in February or so where we waited forever to have a server come to our table (on a night that was not extremely busy) and then the server never came back until the meal ended and she brought us our check. No water refills, no drink refills, no ""how's your food?"" (which was probably good since I would have returned mine to the kitchen), nothing from this server. We had to get other servers to do things like refill our drinks or busboys to bring us chips. This isn't the only time we've had less than attentive service from the Rosepepper staff, either. Combined with the less than flavorful food, I have very little reason to ever eat here again.

We were both in the need for something small and after looking through the menu I ordered the special for the day: Tamales vera cruz, while my gf got the small chicken quesadilla and a mango margarita. The tamale was pretty good, authentic a little on the blander side but the beans and rice made up for it-the salsas were helpful with that too. My gf liked the quesadilla which had its share of veggies in it along with just meat and chicken and it was really tasty. She really enjoyed her margarita which was on the stronger side but with a nicely sweet taste.

No, but I don't come here looking for super authentic food anyways. I like to think of them as Mexican with a modern twist and what they do make, they do very well. I particularly love anything with their shredded beef in it and the chimichangas -- the tortilla tastes like a pastry and it's sooo good. You also can't go wrong with the buffalo cheese dip with chorizo, the tamales, or the carne asada burrito, which is giant and can easily be split between two people.OH and if you love spicy food, you've got to try the Rosepepper Special Enchiladas -- they cover the enchiladas in their super spicy, but delicious, chile verde pork. I prefer them with the shredded beef, but the chicken is good too.Come here for big portions, decent prices and their killer margaritas (especially during happy hour).

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Wow. I feel badly giving a place a one star review, but seriously. The margaritas here are the BEST in ALL of Nashville? Really, Nashville? Not to sound snobby, but I feel sorry for Nashville if that's the case. I came into Nashville for a weekend wedding and we had the bachelorette dinner here. I first ordered the sangria. Big mistake. Anytime I have ordered sangria, there has always been fruit in it. Not at Rosepepper! No fruit. It tasted like a sprite that wasn't properly mixed, not enough syrup, that had gone flat and been sitting in a warm car, and then you stuck it in the fridge trying to make it cold again, but it just didn't work. I have *never* sent a drink back to the bar.... until now. This was truly undrinkable. I tried to be as polite as possible in telling the waitress that I simply could not drink it and decided to try the Margarita instead since this is what they are know for. The waitress was friendly and didn't give me a hard time about it. She told me that most people think the sangria is pretty horrible, but she can't really tell people to not order it. That made me feel better... like I'm not the only one hating on it. The margarita was OK. It wasn't bad, but I've had many better ones. Nothing to write home about and I really can't believe that Nashvilians can't find a better one. Enough about that though, on to the food. We ordered chips and guac. Again, I really don't want to sound like a snotty brat, but I'm seriously struggling to come up with something positive to say about this place.

It's not something you would write home about, but the quality is good enough and the quantity is more than adequate. Our server was friendly, and even though very busy, seemed to always be in the area when someone needed a glass of water or later, a new fork after flinging it several feet while making a really big hand gesture.If Rosepepper was in school, it wouldn't be an A+ student, but as I recall, it was a lot more fun to hang out and have a drink or 3 with the B students.

The service will be average at bestOk, now I know some of you are wondering why I gave it 4 stars. Here goes:The food is tasty. If you want fancy Mexican, go to Cantina Laredo. I, for one, am happy to get good chips with 3 salsas, and a damn good chimichanga w/rice and beans  for $7. They also have a delicious fajita salad for the ladies and gents watching their waistline. The margaritas are above average as well. No neon green, ecto HI-C colored mix used in these babies. Fresh lime juice, good tequila, and a healthy pour make for a happy mouth. I feel like Nashville doesn't know a decent margarita. The heartburn inducing, aforementioned mix is the norm, and shouldn't be. It's lazy and disparages the good name of Margarita, wherever she may be. If you care about decor in a Mexican restaurant, I dont think you are Mexican food material. Christmas lights year round, sombrero's and cheap church fellowship hall chairs are the standard set here. Also, the two best Mex places I have ever been to looked like they were selling blow out of the back. Service usually does suck, but just order everything at once and you will be fine.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Rosepepper - the East Nashville Mexican staple.  I've been hearing about Rospepper for years, especially about their award winning margarita.  That's unfortunately the only thing that was really award-winning about my experience with Rosepepper.  I'll start at the beginning:Chips and salsa came out.  Chips were crisp and fresh.  An assortment of three salsas came out, mild, verde, and ""hot"", the ""hot"" being quite a good salsa. (Rosepepper's explanation of my criticizing the unspicy ""hot"" sauce might be that their focus is on Sonora-style Mexican cuisine, which is in nature not spicy.  Eh, whatever.)  Really, it was maybe the best thing I ate.  The verde salsa was syrupy and extremely mild, and maybe too sweet.  And the mild salsa - could hardly pass as salsa.  It was tomato paste with a few herbs and spices.We had a casa margarita and a frozen peach margarita.  These margaritas are HARDCORE.  Lots of alcohol.  They're  well made and homemade.  However, if you're lookin' for a real sweet concoction, I'd hit Cantina Laredo first.  And ladies go on Ladies Night Thursdays when the margaritas are $6.We had the fish tacos and a combination plate including a bean chimichanga and chicken taco.  Chimiganga was a cute burrito-sized fried pocket filled with yummy beans and topped with a Buffalo cheese sauce.  Yummy, it's hard to go wrong with an item like this - especially for me, because I love beans.  I know it sounds funny, but I really do.  The chicken taco was really bland.  Flavorless!  Well cooked and well, but totally without any character.  Fish tacos were well battered, and accompanied by a tangy mayo sauce.  Did I mention tangy??This may be the most amusing part of my meal.  The combination  platter was accompanied by ""lime veggies"".  Sounds like an over-complimentary description for what came out on the plate, which was clearly raw carrots, cucumber, and celery.  Uh, nice try.You know, it's a cool place with a varied menu.  I know it's a really hip hang, any restaurant with the cheapest margarita priced at $8 would be.  But honestly from my experience tonight, I wouldn't come here again.  The service was plenty fine and the setting was fine, but the food just wasn't good enough.",Rosepepper Mexican Grill,6152274777,295 reviews,2010-04-12,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rosepepper-mexican-grill-nashville,2.0,373,"Washington, DC",Rachel S.

It was topped with tomatillo salsa and came with a side of guac. The flavors came together better than I figured and I cleaned my plate, for sure. I don't think I'll order it again, though, because it was something I could throw together at home.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I'm not very happy with the value of Rosepepper.  Their food is a little expensive for what you get, it seems.  For example, nearly all dishes are small to moderately sized, and they deceive you with large portions of rice and beans.  This is not gourmet Mexican food, and don't ever think it is, no matter how many actors visit.  The music is good, that is true.I've been twice and once had enchiladas (they tasted very bland, and the spinach was just gross) and then a burrito.  I've had far better, fresher-tasting burritos at Qdoba (and Baja on Thompson Lane!).  The veggies were bland and oily.  I added lots of sauces to try to elevate things just a little, but that only goes so far.  I really don't like the rice with peas and carrots and what not.  As someone who perhaps irrationally dislikes peas but likes rice, what the heck?  Throwing some peas in your otherwise utterly boring rice does not by any means save us.The margaritas are great and are alone worth a couple stars.  The chips and salsa are great.  I would go here to drink and have chips, but not for an actual meal again.  It's a shame, because I really wanted to like Rosepepper.",Rosepepper Mexican Grill,6152274777,35 reviews,2012-06-28,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rosepepper-mexican-grill-nashville,2.0,373,"Washington, DC",Will Y.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I'll try to keep this simple. The service was very poor, but I could totally live with that. What I can't live with is utterly awful food. Everything from the bland salsas to the flavorless soup to the dry chicken main dishes was underwhelming. We had chicken tacos and a chicken chimi; both were very dry. The tacos were decorated with cilantro and the chicken appeared blackened, but it was virtually tasteless. The chimi had a small amount of cheese sauce filming on top which was the only thing complementing the chicken (no peppers of any kind on my dish). The margaritas were another story. Beware of the house margarita (even top shelf)--it tends to taste like sweet hard candy as if they use Gatorade instead of lime juice. Our second margaritas were better as we specified tequila and to use actual lime juice. Also on a good note, the tortillas in our main dishes were pretty good.  If you want good Mexican food, hit up your neighborhood strip mall place--it will be better than Rosepepper.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Today's restaurant review is brought to you by the letter 'M,' as in 'Mmm...that is a Mighty fine Margarita.' We went to Rosepepper this past weekend to celebrate one of my bridesmaid's birthdays and had a blast. Since there were 11 of us, we had to wait for some tables out on the heated patio to free up. To kill some time while the rest of the party showed up and while taking in eclectic decorations designed to hide some structural issues (not sure what this place was before a restaurant but there's some odd heating and plumbing work running throughout), we ponied up to the bar area and ordered some house margaritas which were delicious. The bar itself has a cumbersome layout making it difficult for the bartenders to serve drinks in an efficient manner (think of it as 3 people stuffed into an area meant for one person), so at busy times drinks are a bit slow - but they are definitely worth the wait. We were seatedfairly quickly once all of our group arrived and were treated to tons of chips and three types of salsa. Two of the salsas were a bit runny that night, but I'm not going to look down on free chips and salsa. Our waitress arrived and deftly took our orders while keeping our gullets gushing with libation. We ordered some avocado fries which weren't my favorite way to eat avocados but my fiancé was digging them. I ordered the fajita burrito which in all honesty wasn't anything special. My fiancé on the other hand had the dish that I would want again and again - Sonora Style Enchilada. It was spicy, delicious and that verde chili sauce with fried egg to boot was great (I'm glad he shared a little because I'm not sure if I would have). We stayed for a bit until a chill came into the room from patrons keeping the outdoor patio door open (yes, because we all know that the perfect place to have conversations is in open doorways).

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Have drank and eaten at Rosepepper 3x now. The margaritas are outstanding - love that they use the lime juice mix rather than sweet and sour mix like most of the mex places around Nashville.Love that they have 3 salsa options with the chips - tomatillo is the best, although wish it was a little more solid (very liquidy). Was told by many that I must try the queso dip - was not something I would order again, but I think I have a different palate than most southerners. The entrees we tried haven't impressed me. First visit: Enchiladas de Tomatillo - extremely cheesey and somewhat bland, small portion - did not fill me at all. Got the Sonora veg as side - was completely disappointed as the vegs were chili peppers and corn - blah. BF got he Burrito Asada - good, but nothing to write a song about. The guacamole was the highlight - tasted freshly made and delicious. 2nd visit - BF and I tried combo plates (taco, enchilada, flauta, chimichanga, rice and beans) - not impressed with any of the items. Bummer. 3rd visit - chicken fajitas: love that chicken is nicely trimmed/cleaned with no boogery things left on it and that green peppers were plentiful and not overcooked/mushy. Not seasoned enough though (bland). Taco al carbon - looking for authentic taco, not quite it - chicken bland and onions/cilantro/lime could not season it up enough (did not think that was possible).  All times the greeters/hosts and waitstaff were very friendly.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Good food, great margaritas, fun atmosphere, so-so service would sum up my thoughts on Rosepepper. Since living in East Nashville since '07 I have eaten here many time with fairly consistent results each time. The chips are always fresh and crispy and the three varieties of salsa (mild, hot, and tomatillo-the best one) are always a nice way to start your meal. Their cheese dip is REALLY good and has a little chorizo on top for a little extra flavor and spice. the guacamole is good, but nothing extraordinary. Both the cheese dip and guacamole do come with these deliciously sinful and puffy fried flour tortilla chips that are a nice change from the corn tortilla chips that accompany the salsas.  Definitely cool off with one...or three of their delicious margaritas to enjoy with your meal. My personal favorite is the original one, but the pineapple one is a close second. I tried the peach, but it wasn't as flavorful and peachy as I expected, so I wouldn't recommend that one if a lot of flavor is what you're after. Once the chips, dips, and margaritas have you nice and primed, it's time for the entrees. My personal favorites are the mixed grill fajitas, fish tacos, and my very favorite, the Rosepepper Special. The fajitas won me over because they keep the vegetables nice and crunchy without using a lot of oil. Most places bring out your fajitas and you are staring at a sizzling platter full of oil and greasy, overcooked veggies. Not here. I also like to get the chicken and steak mixed so that there is some variety.Not to mention, the shrimp fajitas are also a winner. The fish tacos are really good and can be fried or grilled, depending on your mood/willpower. The grilled ones are good, but let's be real, you are getting the fried ones because they are awesome! A generous piece of fish, fried golden and crispy, fresh cabbage, and a wonderfully creamy and cool crema to top all of that yumminess, all wrapped up in a toasted corn tortilla. Now the Rosepepper Special is not for everyone, especially for the faint of heart...or should I say heat. Tis dish consists of two enchilada with your choice of chicken or shredded beef, then topped with a mouth melting verde pork salsa that is out. of. this. world. Cue the margaritas being quickly refilled because this one will set you ablaze, but I love spicy food and don't mind breaking a little sweat to enjoy this.....but you must love hot food to make it through this experience. One of my favorite things about Rosepepper is the variety of sides. Not only do they offer the typical refried beans and rice, they also offer black beans or Sonora vegetables (a sauteed mix of corn, onions, peppers, and cactus) as a nice change from the typical. One of my least favorite things about Rosepepper is the hit and miss service. Sometimes you go and feel like a prince, other times, a pauper. The servers are usually nice and attentive, but sometimes you get Mr. or Ms. Moodypants and the refills and general duties fall by the wayside. That being said, I have had many more good experiences than bad and if you want my dos pesos, I would still highly recommend Rosepepper before I would most other Mexican restaurants in Nashville.",Rosepepper Mexican Grill,6152274777,31 reviews,2012-11-20,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rosepepper-mexican-grill-nashville,4.0,373,"Washington, DC",Anthony C.
"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I am giving this place a 5-star rating because their house margaritas are fantastic, the service is great, and I like the atmosphere. I agree with the people that say their food is nothing to write home about, but I still think it's really good. I haven't eaten anything that I found offensive there. I also like the fact that they give you three different kinds of salsa with your chips. The burritos are effin huge. I really like the Sonora burrito. It's the only thing I get when we go. I am one of those people that tend to get obsessed with one particular menu item and will lose my shit if there is a menu change that removes said item from the menu. It happened at Olive Garden a few years back; it wasn't pretty. Anyway... Rosepepper is a fun place to go.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Our friends suggested this place for dinner.  I was a little surprised, since they knew this was my first time to Tennessee and they recommend a Mexican joint?  Because there isn't any decent Mexican food in California...  ;)  It was a little busy when we arrived so we had some drinks on their patio area.  I'm a slow drinker and I was almost done with my drink by the time our table was ready.  So obviously, this was a popular restaurant!   What I liked was how there were THREE kinds of salsas!!  Yeah!!  Salsa!  And we also ordered the fresh guacamole.  Delisio!  I heart good guacamole and I was would have been happy eating chips, salsa and the guacamole for dinner.  I ordered the carnitas platter and that was also super yummy.  Not overly greasy and flavorful!  I ate so much of the chips and salsa that I ended up taking the leftovers back to our hotel room and it still tasted good the next day!",Rosepepper Mexican Grill,6152274777,50 reviews,2012-02-27,"Santa Clara, CA",/biz/rosepepper-mexican-grill-nashville,4.0,373,"Washington, DC",K R.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Okay. Rose Pepper tears me apart inside, I just have to say this. The margaritas.....the margaritas. I'm kind of drunk right now off their margaritas. I come here time and time again and tolerate the mediocre food just for these magical margs.Which brings me to the food. I've had the enchiladas, the tequitos, the rice and beans, the spinach quesadillas, the soup, etc. All extremely lackluster. Someone needs to introduce a little thing called cumin or maybe some chili pepper to this place. Salt and pepper, anything...DAMN. For real, I had better quesadillas made in a dorm room microwave.

Every experience I've had at Rosepepper has been pretty good. Their thicker, double fried chips are ready for some serious salsas, and  I appreciate the multiple choices, especially the salsa verde. I recently got the chicken enchiladas, and wasn't extremely impressed by the rojo sauce on top. My friend got the Juevos Chorizo (it was the weekend), and enjoyed it a lot.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"The man and I visited Rosepepper for lunch, mainly because if I am going to try somewhere I may or may not like, I'd rather pay for a lunch special than a more expensive dinner and risk being let down and for more money!Rosepepper is not an inexpensive restaurant in my opinion for the style of food. The portions are minimal in comparison to more traditional Mexican/Latin restaurants, however, I did appreciate the quality. I ordered the Chimi (about as nontraditional as you can get I know) with Chicken and the Flautas with shredded chicken as part of the lunch combo it comes with rice and beans as well.The rice was nothing special, very basic rice with what appeared to be frozen veggies fried in but I am okay with that, it tasted good! The beans were very good, there are so many ways to go wrong with beans, too salty, not salty enough, too runny, too dry - the beans were spot on. The chips were good, the salsas were very tasty I particularly liked the salsa verde and took a small amount with me for my leftovers. The only downside was the chicken was a tad bit bland. The quality was definitely there, appeared to be shredded breast meat rather than a hodge podge of fat and dark meat that you may find at other places, but it lacked a bit of seasoning. I would have been elated if it had more flavor, overall though it was a good meal. Our service was exceptional. The waitress was very attentive, friendly and accommodating to our 13 month old Son. She brought him water with a lid and straw, and when placing hot plates on the table was careful to place everything out of his reach. This is a huge deal breaker for us as Parents.I like that this is situated in the East End area near Ugly Muggs and other East Nash favorite, but I dare say that is why you will notice the slightly steeper prices. The food is good, the service is welcoming and friendly, the patio is lovely and I am sure it is a lot of fun at happy hour or in nice weather, we were there during rain! :( I would definitely try other items on the menu and would like to return this fall to enjoy the patio.",Rosepepper Mexican Grill,6152274777,111 reviews,2011-09-14,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rosepepper-mexican-grill-nashville,4.0,373,"Washington, DC",Jenn Z.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"My boyfriend and I had stopped in Red Dog Beads and the owner there had recommended we stop at this restaurant while we were visiting Nashville. The atmosphere felt very fun and the patio was great. We came right at 4:00 when they open back up, so it didn't start filling up until we were finished and leaving. Our server was a sweetheart and attentive. We ordered a spinach quesadilla as an appetizer, which paired great with the three types of salsas brought out. I ordered steak tacos with beans and rice, my boyfriend ordered a burrito (which was literally the largest burrito I've ever seen). He's the lanky type that somehow eats his weight in food everyday, so he was ecstatic and (for the first time that I've ever witnessed) almost couldn't finish it.

I've been here on dates, with groups of friends, for birthdays, for girls' night out, etc. I also know those who bring their whole family. Something for everyone. Great outdoor seating in nice weather. Plenty of room inside, too, and I always enjoy sitting at their bar. I have to admit, I almost always get the same thing. Fish tacos, sub black beans for refried. Sometimes I get the fish fried and sometimes grilled. Fried is tastier. Occasionally, I've been known to order the guac, which comes with these deep fried tortillas (different from the chips) that are so crispy and delicious and probably a heart attack waiting to happen. I've also been known to grab the guac and chips to go when I need to take something to a party at the last minute.I almost forgot to mention the margaritas. That would have been a tragedy.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I am tempted to bump this to a 3 Star Review, but based on my last trip, I'm sticking to my guns.  2 Star it is.  The reason why I am not super loving this place right now is because a group of friends, my husband and I went to Rosepepper on Sunday night, and the waitress couldn't have been less attentive or more rude.  On top of ignoring us when we begged for water and simple things like that, when I was ready to pay, I flagged her down to give her my debit card.  You would have thought I punched her in the face.  It was like it was a HUGE deal and inconvenience to take my money.  The bus boy ended up bringing us water and food, and somehow this girl walked away with the tips.  That made me sad. Overall - The food has always been very sub-par in my opinion.  Not terrible, just not great.  The reason to check this place out is because it's in a fun area, it has a patio for Spring and Summer (even Fall), and the bar is pretty well stocked.  I didn't dig my margarita last time I went because it was way too sweet and I can't even guarantee there was tequila in it, but the beer and well drinks were just fine.  The restaurant gives you chips and 3 salsas for free, which is cool, too.  The avocado fries are interesting, and if you dip them in salsa, they're even better.  Otherwise, it's a typical Mexi restaurant.  It's a fun place to go, especially if you're with a group.  Check it out, but if you get the waitress that we had...I'm sorry.",Rosepepper Mexican Grill,6152274777,80 reviews,2011-04-12,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rosepepper-mexican-grill-nashville,2.0,373,"Washington, DC",Kaitlyn K.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"East Nashville's answer to Mexican foodMargaritas and Queso dip. That's all it takes to make this girl happy.And you know what? The Rose Pepper has Queso and chips as a meal on their menu. Needless to say, I'm a fan for life.As many of these reviews state, Las Palmas pretty much dominates Nashville's Mexican scene and for good reason. BUT there is no Las Palmas in East Nash, and to save the day is the Rose Pepper. Location really saves this restaurant from being over looked, which is great because the service and menu/drink options are stellar. The staff are fantastic and willing to bend over backwards to make your order perfect.The outdoor patio is very comfortable and easy to cater for big groups too.For good competition to Las Palmas, give the Pepper Rose a try.",Rosepepper Mexican Grill,6152274777,134 reviews,2010-10-19,"Los Angeles, CA",/biz/rosepepper-mexican-grill-nashville,5.0,373,"Washington, DC",Lucy M.

I should have tried the ribeye earlier!Of course, one cannot mention Rosepepper without saying something about the Guacamole and Margueritas. The best I've had. They were served to us by Molly who was able to complete the totally awesome experience while the place was slammed on a Saturday night.

But when I was introduced to Rosepepper's in East Nashville, I was impressed. The food is moderate at best, but the choice of salsas and margaritas might be some of the best I've had in town.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I love the idea of Rosepepper, but every time I eat here I am disappointed with everything except for my margarita. Most recently, the wait was so long and ridiculous (took more than an hour for a party of six -- and larger parties behind us took their seats before we did) that I have decided I am done with this place, at least until next summer when the patio opens up again.The salsa options aren't bad -- you get hot, mild and verde for free -- and I agree that the fried avocado appetizer is good (though nothing compared to Alley Cat, RIP), as is the buffalo queso with chorizo. Word to the wise: If you like sweet tea, do not let them convince you to order their mango tea (since they don't serve sweet tea).The rest of the menu is extensive, a crowd-pleaser, and it always sounds delicious, but my friends and I have been underwhelmed more often than not. I don't know if it's because I grew up on cheap Mexican food or what, but every enchilada I try that's not on the a la carte menu is always in some specialty sauce that my taste buds just don't enjoy. The taco salad was meh, and the tamales aren't as good as ones that cost half as much on Gallatin Road.The margaritas, however, and the atmosphere are Rosepepper's saving grace. The patio in the summer is screened in, and nothing beats a pitcher of their always-strong house margarita on a hot July day. The margs actually come in a number of flavors -- raspberry, strawberry, mango -- that are delicious frozen treats.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Eaten here for years. Excellent food and the best Margaritas. Drinks are a bit pricey with Margarita pitchers approaching $30.  They never hurt for business. Downside: they've begun charging for chips and salsa, can't be because they're hurting for income.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"The Rosepepper is the centerpiece of a lovely and growing little district on Eastland.  The restaurant specializes in ""Sonora"" style cuisine, which, according to their menu, is a blend of traditional Mexican and contemporary international flavors.  Honestly, this might be just a tiny bit of a cop out, because the food always strikes me as traditional but not especially unique.As noted in past reviews, one of The Rosepepper's most unique attributes is its patio, which is quite a lovely locale for sipping margaritas on a breezy summer evening.  And while we're on the margaritas, allow me to digress only for a moment... Say what you will about The Rosepepper; I believe they have some of the finest margaritas in the city.  The Rosepepper's management also runs Foo Bar on Gallatin Road, so you can sample them there as well.  Anyhow, the margaritas are probably the reason I'm awarding The Rosepepper four stars.  These tempting and tasty tequila concoctions are quite literally The Rosepepper's saving grace.Anyhow, the food itself is good but not spectacular.  Portions are large, and servers bring three varieties of salsa with your complimentary chips.  Unfortunately, you could probably get food that is as good and more authentic (and certainly cheaper) at a traditional Mexican joint.  I recommend it for newcomers to the East Side, if only for the classy atmosphere and delicious cocktails.",Rosepepper Mexican Grill,6152274777,349 reviews,2008-04-08,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rosepepper-mexican-grill-nashville,4.0,373,"Washington, DC",Patrick R.

The last time I had gone I ordered a veggie burrito. I remember not liking it and that was about my only memory of the experience. I do remember though that they had put really odd vegetables in it. I guess it had been so long since that visit I had forgot how unimpressed I really was. While driving around East Nashville looking for a place to eat this evening we unfortunately ended up at Rosepepper.  My entire meal was just plain bad...wet lettuce in the mediocre salad.... bland food... some sort of Mango overSWEET! tea that tasted like a Yankee Candle. I also noticed a couple of things while I was there. # 1) they are the kind of restaurant that will put one ingredient on every dish. so and so with Tomatillo , burrito with Tomatillo and so on... Feta and Bleu Cheese were another one I noticed on everything. So if you are not a fan of certain ingredients it's kind of a downer. # 2) everyone was drinking. I for one go to a restaurant to eat... not drink... they have bars and clubs for that.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"There are three reasons to go to Rosepepper:1. House Margaritas2. White queso dip.3. Big outdoor patio.For food...it's okay. I might be biased because I'm from California so I think that things like carnitas and tortillas should look and taste a certain way. All in all, I wouldn't say the food is bad...it can be decently good, especially if you know what to order but often things are just a touch bland for my tastes. Burritos are huge --- like a small loaf of bread. But honestly, what I really go to Rosepepper for are the house margaritas. $5 and you get a glass full of tequila with lime and salt. It is just about the best thing to drink on a hot summer's day. Not all sweet and syrupy like lots of places make them. And not like chugging back a cup of gasoline either. Just refreshing and limey.The atmosphere here also helps compensate for the mediocre food. It's almost always bustling with people (lots of young people, which for me, means 20's-30's).

You can't serve a passable $5 burrito--good as it may be--in a slightly nicer atmosphere and expect me to pay $12 for it.  And a margarita that costs more than 5 bucks is pretentious! It's tequila and lemonade fer crissakes!

In my opinion it's a northern Tex Mex joint and not quite the real thing. This isn't to say I don't enjoy the food because I do I just have learned what to order. Being somewhat of a guacamole snob I don't recommend ordering theirs as an appetizer, it's a nice addition on meals, but doesn't really stand on it's own. It's pure avocado: no cilantro, no real chunks of onion or tomato.Some people like that.  When I do get it, I mix it with the salsa. I do love the Gringos appetizer (nachos layered with bean and cheese), which are the only menu listed vegetarian nachos. What I find unique in relation to other Nashville Tex Mex joints is that they use black beans and it comes with salsa, guac, and sour cream in tortilla bowls (rather than actually on top of the nachos). Another variation are the heavy flour tortilla chips that almost remind me more of a pita than a chip. They serve these with the guac as well. The service here has always been very decent, and they have always been accommodating to small groups. My last trip in particular we walked in and were told it would be an hour wait. We were starving so, in front of the hostess, debated going somewhere else. Within 10 minutes we had a table. It's definitely an experience and not a bad place to go, unless you're a Mexican food snob and aren't interested in paying slightly inflated prices.",Rosepepper Mexican Grill,6152274777,325 reviews,2008-12-31,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rosepepper-mexican-grill-nashville,3.0,373,"Washington, DC",Erin D.

The food just doesn't measure up to their great patio ambiance and margaritas. I've had an assortment of the usual Mexican fare there including chicken and beef enchiladas, tacos, flautas,  and all the usual fixings.

And it ended up being ok Mexican. I've been back a few times since and enjoyed it but haven't been blown away. I think the space itself and the outside patio makes up for any deficiencies in the food itself, or maybe food just tastes better with friends and a few margaritas.One menu item I can definitely recommend are the fried sweet pepper rings. I guess it would be hard to make a list of favorite fried vegetables, but these were something I had never had before and had a nice flavor. The food itself was a little bland to me.

But that's where the goods stopped and bads started...the server was extremely slow. we were seated for about 15-20 mins, dusting off 2 bowls of chips before the server even took our order. then we dusted off 2 more bowls of chips and salsa before our food came out. and this is where the real grip begins...WTH is up w/ the basics here? i have never had any mexican/spanish RICE w/ frozen pea, carrot, and bean mix. this is abolutely atrocious! this is not chinese fried rice, but it sure looked and tasted like one. the BEANS... well, the beans sucked too. it was more like bean soup; very watery and tasteless. now to the entree, well, i ordered the combo plate with shredded beef enchilada, pork tamales, and chicken chimichanga... the ENCHILADA was basically a taco. they used corn tortilla with the beef inside. they didn't even bother to make it look like a enchillada, but it was descent. the TAMALES looked gross. i don't know what kind of tamales they're are used to, but the color of the corn looked grey/brown. the texture of the corn shell was very rubbery, not good at all. the CHIMICHANGA was just a disaster. i couldn't even try the second bite b/c it was just straight up NASTY!!!honestly, this is not a mexican joint, but the vibe is good.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Let me start off by saying that I *was* a long-time patron of this East Nashville staple. I used to think this place was wonderful and have hosted many gatherings, had a few first dates, and too many margaritas here. That is until my most recent experience. I've moved out west- Seattle to be exact, a city not lacking in great restaurants, especially Mexican- and wanted to have my last meal in town with my family and closest friends at The Rose Pepper. I called days in advance- 5 days to be exact- and asked to make a reservation for 7 for a Friday night. This action I feel is as much a stress-reliever for me and my party as it is for the establishment- what restaurant wants a large party to show up with no warning on a weekend night [their website states that they accept reservations]? The man who answered my call said that all reservations must be approved by a manager. I can handle that. He also said that technically reservations are only for parties of 8 or above. I said I could make it for 8 then and would just invite another person. He said he would put us down in the books and I should hear from the manager the following day. By the next day's end, I hadn't heard word. I called again and was informed that there was no record of my reservation. The woman that answered this time gave me the same spiel and took my info. Except that she already had my info. Which confused me, as I thought there was no record of my reservation...still confused about that one. Anyways, the woman said, even though she'd probably be ""fired"", that she'd make my reservation without the manager's consent. Whatever gets us a table. So the manager calls on Friday, the day of my dinner, basically saying that she technically cannot uphold my reservation since she had no prior knowledge [not my fault, right?], but will do me a ""favor"" and ""allow"" my party our table, as long as all *8* of us are there ten minutes *prior* to our reservation time. Excuse me? I called The Rosepepper, right? And not The Palm? Nobu? I mean, I'm awfully sorry Rosepepper to have so inconvenienced you with my courtesy of making a reservation for EIGHT margarita drinking adults. I'll be sure to never do this again. And to tell all my rather Nashville savvy friends to stay clear of this, let's face it, mediocre quasi-Mexican mess. Taco Mamacita is much better [and cleaner] anyways. Regardless, I canceled my reservation [still confused as to whether if I had shown up at 7 if we would've been served...] and went to THE YELLOW PORCH. This was a much better choice for my last Nashville dinner. This kind of treatment would never hold up in Seattle.

"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"First, I would like to point out in reference to the two reviews below that there are many different styles of Mexican cuisine. The style served at Rosepepper is Sonoran. I do not care in general for Jalisco style cuisine but that does not mean that it is not mexican food. That being said I absolutley LOVE the Chimichangas here. They use a very thick flour tortilla and fry it so that it is crisp. The Tamales are super. They come wrapped in a bannana leaf and are darker in color than what most people serve in this area which are wrapped in corn husks. They have excellent margaritas that always seem fresh. My only gripes about the place would be that the service can be inconsistent. I have had some rude servers there and some great servers. I would also say that their salsa is inconsistently mixed. I have been there and loved it and other times felt it was tasteless.Overall i would say it is one of the better mexican rest. in nashville and a nice change from the norm.",Rosepepper Mexican Grill,6152274777,9 reviews,2007-08-12,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rosepepper-mexican-grill-nashville,4.0,373,"Washington, DC",Janin O.
"1907 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Rosepepper is definitely another sweet spot on the east side.  Similar to what other people have said, it is pricier than your normal mexican restaurant, but I believe that the quality for the most part, is a little above your standard place as well. For one, their margaritas are amazing. When I was there and I assume that this is always the case, we had Patron Margaritas, and that was not by choice, that is the standard. They are incredible and incredibly strong. The food is also really good, very fresh, and their menu is a little different than most mexican places.  If you like spicy, and I mean it will make you sweat spicy, try their verde pork. It has a a lot of flavor and is really good, but only if you can handle it. It was really a little too much for me, but the waitress will let you try it before you order it, just to let you feel the heat. The atmosphere is also cool and original and even a little hip.  They also serve sour cream and guacomole in fried tortilla cups, which is pretty awesome as well.

"3214 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"Only rarely has a restaurant provided so many conflicting bases for a review. On one hand, the Cajun cuisine is generally really tasty and fills a niche that is largely unfilled in the Nashville area. Those two things count for a lot, for sure. However, one must all contend with a genuinely misleading website, prices approaching obscene, and a generally dysfunctional workstaff.I ordered a crawfish etouffee with carrots and slaw for sides, based on the web-indicated price of $14.95. I placed a to-go order and showed up based on the approximate time I was told over the phone, which turned out to be a good 25 minutes before the food was actually ready. But no matter, I wasn't really in a rush and the time had sounded a bit over-optimistic anyway. What did bug me was that I ended up getting run up for over $20, as it turned out my entree was actually $18.95 before tax. I can understand a small discrepancy between online and current prices, but over 25% higher? Give me a break. The cole slaw was pretty forgettable, but the great carrots and etouffee were tasty enough that I honestly have to consider returning in spite of all other things.

"3214 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"OK, my Baton Rouge companion gives this place a 2.5, and let me premise by saying that - 1) there was a fight in the middle of the restaurant  between the chef and waitress and the waitress proceeded to say some obscenities and storm out 2) too much BBQ sauce on the stuffed pork chop (unlike the show) 3) out of several sides 4) chef was yelling at other staff membersAnyways, we saw this place on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and the restaurant is crawling with signs from his show - they won't really let you forget that they had that opportunity. All the menus and wall decorations have Guy Fieri's face all over it. The show specifically showed the stuffed pork chops (which we both wanted) and starved from a full day. So appetizers consisted of smoked sausage and linked boudin. They were out of the Boudin Balls.  Smoked Sausage was too sauced. It just points to the meat not being either 1) cooked well 2) not of good quality hence NEEDING the sauce to overpower the flavor. The linked Boudin was good, i was a little taken confused on how to eat the linked Boudin but it was delicious none the less. Then the pork chops came - dripping in BBQ sauce. It takes away from the meat. It looked so good on the show and although it tasted good it wasn't THAT good. And not for $14.95 each. The fight broke out shortly after our waitress got a phone call while walking around the restaurant from someone and started screaming about house keys and ""being done with this sh**"". She seemed to be in a relationship with the chef and both of them escaped to the back room with muffled screams. Maybe it was apart of the ambiance, i doubt it, regardless the truth remains the same. The situation they placed the customers in  was extremely unprofessional, the food was not as good 'as seen on TV' (sadly) and the food choice was limited due to their stock.

"3214 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"I had seen this place on Diner's Drive-ins and Dives a while back, and decided the next time I was in Nashville I would swing by.  A friend and I decided to have a guys weekend and headed up.  We wanted to try this place as we both love seafood as well as cajun food.  Most places barely float above water when it comes to calling themselves a cajun restaurant.  Typically, just lots of paprika and deep fried breading and hushpuppies that are stale and bland.  So we pulled up to this dive, and there was one car in the parking lot on a Friday evening in a 'transitional' location of town.  It took a few minutes for us to figure out where the entrance was, which is in back. When you walk up, you may be tempted to think that you are about to enter a shady business that is a front for something else.  To us, this added to the interest.  When we walked in, there was one person just finishing a meal, and the hostess told us we could sit where we wanted.  We selected a table near the counter, which is basically like an old lunch-style buffet with all the sides / etc. in pans behind a glass divider.  We opted to try a few things from the menu, the cajun sausage, the boudin balls and the all-u-can-eat catfish.  I have to say, from the moment the first item arrived until the last, it was a fantastic meal.  They didn't spend extra money on decorations, high rent or trendy looks, but rather put their money where their mouth is and made amazingly delicious food.  The spices were just right, the boudin balls were killer, and the catfish was lightly breaded, spicy and some of the best I've had.  Also, don't go there unless you plan to eat, as there is a TON of food in each serving.  Some places have all-u-can-eat and its designed to give you a decent first portion, then the subsequent portions get smaller / longer to arrive and don't taste as good.  Completely the opposite here.  Our second helping of catfish was double the size of the initial order, and as good if not better than the first.  Oh, and the hushpuppies were moist and packed with flavor.  I would recommend this place as a fun, casual / dress-down place to get a surprisingly good meal.  As we were leaving, 3 more people showed up, but otherwise was nearly empty (their main business is apparently lunch).  I would suggest going for dinner and make sure your belt has a few extra holes.",Bro’s Cajun Cuisine,6153292626,5 reviews,2014-09-05,"Acworth, GA",/biz/bros-cajun-cuisine-nashville,5.0,75,"Washington, DC",Ryan H.

Once again, I have made gumbo at home that blows this away. The smoked sausage in the gumbo was also good, but did not seem authentic to me. The real Louisiana smoked sausage I have had is more coarse and natural in texture than what was in this gumbo.  Bro's is more pink and more like a commercial smoked sausage you would buy in a supermarket.I also ordered fried frogs legs. Again, virtually no flavor. They do not add any spices to their flour apparently...or the frog legs. They were not terrible, just not really flavorful at all...bland and boring.My wife ordered the shrimp po boy. She said the bread (appeared to be a baguette) was fantastic, but like my frogs legs (I tasted a bite of her shrimp) there was zero seasoning. Her sandwich was good she said, but the shrimp was unremarkable. The sandwich was made in two halves that were nearly impossible to join in to one cohesive sandwich, but all in all it was good.My wife also optioned for the cucumber salad as her side. She said it was OK...but yet again, my homemade cucumber salad blows it away. I guess I'm a better cook that I thought!All in all, Bro's has some decent home-style food...but it weren't no trip to ""flavor town"" for us. We did not try everything obviously, so your mileage may vary. I'll bet some of the food is great, but this place could really use a good cleaning and renovation.",Bro’s Cajun Cuisine,6153292626,58 reviews,2013-10-14,"Troy, VA",/biz/bros-cajun-cuisine-nashville,3.0,75,"Washington, DC",Kenny D.

"3214 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"We had a very memorable and borderline-strange lunch experience here. I was a little nervous based on the appearance of the restaurant, both inside and out, but the food made for up for any negative first impressions I had. The restaurant is a little house in an interesting area, to put it gently.  We were helped right away and directed to a back room with a few mismatched tables and chairs in it.  There seemed to be several seating areas upstairs and down, all ummm.... eclectically decorated?The waiter was clearly truly Cajun, as it was sort of hard to understand him most of the time. Is that bad to say?  I'm not hating, I'm French Canadian, we talk funny too. The food was all really good! We ordered an appetizer that came out after the meals, and water refills were few and far between, but it was generally a good experience.Now for the memorable parts: 1: The gumbo is served in shallow, very full bowls... Do you see where I'm going with this...? Let's just say that because of the way the bowl was placed on the table, my boyfriend opted to work from home for the rest of the day due to the now infamous ""gumbo pants.""2: On our way out we chatted with Chef Breaux for a few minutes.  He told us about his experience with Guy Fieri when Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives was there and told us about the restaurant's history, etc, which was all really interesting.  Then he asks us what part of town we live in.  When I say West Nashville he immediately asks me, in all seriousness, ""Who's your daddy??""It took everything I had to hold back my laughter as I realized that he was just honestly asking if he knew my family.  Call me immature, but it was hilarious.",Bro’s Cajun Cuisine,6153292626,188 reviews,2012-05-25,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bros-cajun-cuisine-nashville,3.0,75,"Washington, DC",Lisa B.
"3214 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"Ah yes.  My former Friday Lunch Lover.  For a good part of a year and a half, my bosses and I would go here EVERY Friday.   We would literally ALL only order 1 thing off of the menu (I have since tried a few different things since then).   But before Darrell Breaux (he is the owner...great guy) made it on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on Food Network this was my local place.   Things to keep in mind.  You don't want to sit down stairs because from my experience the service tends to suffer down there, depending on the time you go obviously.   So if planning on eating at Bro's for lunch it's best to get there at 11 or 1pmish.    If the entire table is intent on ordering something different for each of you...tack on time of staying there MUCH longer for lunch.   If like me you know you are going to order a bowl of LARGE Red Beans and Rice with the best Sweet Tea in town then you are better suited to eat and go, otherwise the experience could become a full on event called ""waiting"".  Though service has gotten better over the years I will admit.If you take the time to get to know Chad (one of Darrell's sons) you will find his gruff humor hilarious over time.Darrell too has a great sense of humor and loves to come around and ask everyone how their meal is today.   My favorite line he ever said to me was ""What do you mean you didn't get onions on your Beans (short for red beans and rice)?   I like my women like I like my onions, because they both make me cry.""Prices are great.  Atmosphere is divey, but fun.  I know it's on Charlotte Pike and knife fights are common, but don't worry, this place is only open past 330pm on 1 day every week, Friday, so you don't have to worry about gun shots during the mid part of the day.",Bro’s Cajun Cuisine,6153292626,236 reviews,2012-02-03,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bros-cajun-cuisine-nashville,5.0,75,"Washington, DC",Zach G.

I've seriously driven by this place hundreds of times, but until was looking for it I missed it.All in all a good experience with a few strange hitches.Our waiter was apparently so Cajun it almost made it difficult to understand what he was saying.  He also had a strange tendency to make me uncomfortable. Case in point:  Apparently too much Gumbo was made for another party and another waitress was kind enough to give me a cup (not a full size bowl) of Gumbo on the house.  As this was my first visit I was enthusiastic to try some.  When my waiter (Who must be one of the owners) discovered this he became very inquisitive, to the point of interrogating ME about how I got this cup of gumbo.  I tried to explain as best as I could, but he continued to quiz staff members until finally he just said something to the effect of ""Well, okay"".  The better half of the Yelp couple and I came up with several humorous situations as to how I could have nefariously obtained this gumbo.The second problem was that since the cooking is done right there in the same room with the customers and it did have a tendency to overpower the senses, including making both of our eyes water.The Gumbo, and my Po Boy were quite delicious though, and I would happily return.",Bro’s Cajun Cuisine,6153292626,787 reviews,2010-12-18,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bros-cajun-cuisine-nashville,3.0,75,"Washington, DC",David O.

"3214 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"Went to Bro's on 1/14/2012 at opening (4:00pm). The food was very good, the service was another story. Food is traditional Cajun and plentiful. Large portions and a nice ""dive"" atmosphere. However, the waiter was not very attentive and be careful when ordering on the menu, as prices don't accurately reflect what you'll be charged at the register. I ordered a full slab of ribs. I wanted 1/2 on my plate and the other 1/2 to go. This was after the waiter suggest I do that because I couldn't decide between the 1/2 slab or a full slab. Price for a 1/2 slab on the menu: $14.99. Full slab price: $20.95. I figured if I ate the 1/2 and wanted more, I already had it on tap. If not, lunch tomorrow. Imagine my surprise when I got to the register and saw they had upped the price of a full slab to $25.99.  This was shown on a post-it note, at the register, and had been covered by some knick-knack.  The waiter failed to mention that the price of a full slab had gone up.  Furthermore, imagine my shock when I was charged $14.99 TWICE on my bill.  That's right.  They charged me $29.98 for a full slab, not the $25.99 the post it note had said.My card had been ran at this time when my wife noticed the discrepancy in price.  She brought it to the attention of the cashier who said she would get it worked out.  Out came the owner and said ""well, it's a heat up fee"".  Not really sure what that meant, as I was taking my leftovers home anyway.  The lady hastily tried to explain to me that there's some sort of unwritten ""warm up fee"" attached to ribs.  She said ""since its only a couple of dollars difference, how about we let this slide for the confusion?""  I responded by telling her I didn't appreciate the ""miscommunication"" of their menu's, post-it's, and ""fee's"" that aren't on the menu.  In the end, my card had already been charged and the fee will stand.  I just know this was my second and last time at bro's because of this.So to sum it up:  food is good, service is lousy.  Make sure you get the current prices before you order and scrutinize your bill.",Bro’s Cajun Cuisine,6153292626,7 reviews,2012-01-14,"Columbia, TN",/biz/bros-cajun-cuisine-nashville,3.0,75,"Washington, DC",J.

"3214 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"Bro's Cajun on Fat Tuesday, hell yeah.  I have ridden past this joint multiple times, but never had the chance to give it a try until today.  First off, a bit of an embarissing confession.  I actually enjoy Diner's, Drive-ins and Dives quite a bit and when I saw that Bro's makes and smokes all their own sausages on the show then it was really just a matter of time before I made a trip.  The place definitely qualifies as a bit of a dive.  It is tucked away next to the interstate in a pretty commercial stretch of Charlotte ave and interior is extremely basic.  If you are going to Bro's you are going for the food and it does not disappoint.  This is not an upscale New Orleans type restaurant.  Bro's is Cajun soul food, red beans and rice, jambolaya, crawfish, po-boys.  Food that is simple and delicious.  I had the red beans and rice and the sausage lived up to my high expectations.  Best red beans and rice that I have had in Nashville.  The rest of the menu looked excellent and I have to try the stuffed (with sausage) porkchop sometime soon.   Good stuff, I will be back.",Bro’s Cajun Cuisine,6153292626,214 reviews,2011-03-08,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bros-cajun-cuisine-nashville,4.0,75,"Washington, DC",Ian R.
"3214 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"I was very disappointed with my visit to this place. I called ahead of my visit to check to make sure they were selling crawfish that evening since the location was out of my way. I drove there after work so there crowd wasn't heavy.The wait for the crawfish was at least 45 minutes. The crawfish when I finally got it was cold, small, and not spicy. I even requested extra it to be spicy. As a person being used to actual folks in Louisiana cooking my crawfish, I was extremely disappointed. I would never go again.

"3214 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"Having just moved from New Orleans a few months ago, I am always skeptical of cajun restaurants so far away from NOLA. Boy, was I surprised with the quality at Bro's. I went with a few people from my office for lunch a few weeks ago and it just so happened that it was the day before Thanksgiving. The place was packed, and I soon found out why. Not only do they have delicious cajun food, they sell deep friend cajun turkeys for Thanksgiving. As soon as I saw those turkeys, I knew they were legit. You can tell a lot about a cajun restaurant by the flavor of their gumbo. My huge bowl of gumbo, was awesome. The flavors were all spot on. The roux was dark and flavorful and it was accompanied by house made sausage.For around $10 I got giant bowl of gumbo and two sides. What a great deal!

"3214 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"Wife, two year old daughter and I were downtown in Nashville and decided to try Bros after seeing it featured on TV's Diners Drive Ins and Dives.I tried to order the Crawfish out of season, not their fault.Wait staff was friendly and quick.  I ordered shrimp Po Boy, we ordered red beans and rice for my 2 year old and the wife ordered a plain cheese burger after she tried to order chicken fricassee.  We were told after we tried to order that the menu was being changed and some things on the menu where not available.My 2 year old and I did enjoy the thin cut potato chip style fries.The red beans and rice was well received.  My Po Boy had 6 small, dried, over fried tasteless shrimp.  The shrimp were small enough that the giant bun it came on looked empty and sad.   The french bread that made up the bun was decent.....Evidently the waitress did not hear ""Plain"" when my wife ordered.  My wife's plain burger came decked with everything.  She does not do lettuce and just ate the red beans and rice dish.  The cheese burger was taken off our bill and the server was apologetic.The reason I gave it a second star was the Boudin Sausage I had as an appetizer.  Just the right amount of spice and aromatic from the fresh herbs in it.  The Boudin was 4 star, wish the rest of my visit had been.Would like to try it again when crawfish are in season and give them another chance.",Bro’s Cajun Cuisine,6153292626,7 reviews,2011-12-15,"Spring Hill, TN",/biz/bros-cajun-cuisine-nashville,2.0,75,"Washington, DC",Don N.
"3214 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"I saw this place on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and just had to try it.  I've been there twice now.  I have mixed feelings about it honestly, but it's good southern cooking anyway you look at it.  The reason I have some negative feelings is that 1.they're only open on Friday nights for dinner and not at all on Sat and Sun, 2.because they're not open on the weekend and the only night is Fridays, if they run out of something Friday they're not making anymore of it for the rest of the evening.  I still haven't been able to try the boudin balls as a result.  Also, they had no desert the second time I went which was disappointing because I had a really good carrot cake the first time that I was looking forward to having again.The positives are many.  The place is cozy, the service is excellent.  The food is authentic home cooking.  I've tried the catfish bites, the sampler, and the fried catfish.  The catfish, the gumbo, and the shrimp creole are probably my favorite.  The crawfish etouffee I didn't care for and I will agree with a lot of the other posts on here though that I expected all of these items to be spicer given the cajun nature of cooking.  I think there are some negative posts on here because trying to compare someone else's version of what you've grown up with is a hard thing to do because of bias.  However, if you don't really have a background in cajun food and just looking to give your palate something different to savor, you won't go wrong with Bro's.",Bro’s Cajun Cuisine,6153292626,27 reviews,2011-07-18,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bros-cajun-cuisine-nashville,4.0,75,"Washington, DC",Matt E.

"3214 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,Stopped in for lunch. Jambalaya was very flavorful and plenty of sausage. It was a bit on the dry side. I like mine with a bit more juice. Catfish bites were light and fluffy. Red beans and rice with the sausage was the best item at lunch. Just the right flavor. Also tried the pulled pork sandwich. It was mediocre. They had to heat it up on the griddle and it was chopped up. Served with Cajun fries which were undercooked and greasy. I would not get the BBQ here. Go elsewhere. But if you want some Cajun  they fit the bill. Service was a touch below average.

"3214 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"This place was on the wrong show, should have been Kitchen Nightmares. Gordon always find chefs/owners that have just gotten lazy. I have no doubt Bros can knock you socks off with some good stuff when inspired. Laziness prohibits that from being a everyday/every plate occurrence.No you have not found that special hole in the wall joint that has great food. This place is just dirty. When I found this place online, read reviews and watched the tv spot my mouth watered for weeks for that stuffed pork chop and the smoke sausage. Finally time to go one afternoon, and there closed, mostly lunch hours. Oh man they must really be good to survive off limited hours. Today was the day I made it. The outside makes Arnold's look like the Palms, but that's the beauty of a dive your guest think your insane, but you know whats inside, Cajun, smokey goodness. Well not today. My wife and I and our young son. We were taken down stairs to an awkward room with three large home style table that didn't really fit. The wall was open to a kitchen that looked to be finishing up for the day at 11:30am. As soon as we were seated our drink order was taken and brought, but we never got menus or silverware. The next contact was several minutes later with ""so have you decided yet"". No big worry I have a stuffed chop on my mind, no long menu decisions here. Wife had a veggie plate, and we tasted a sausage app. The pork chop was dry like beef jerky. It had to be cook way prior and just reheated for me. The flavor and smoke was great. I'm disappointed I couldn't taste this the way it is supposed to. A choice of side is fried green tomato, you get two small one. One of mine was the top of the tomato, all skin. The cornbread is bland, unless your a fan of ""hot water"" style cornbread. The only thing I enjoyed was the smoke and spice.Just when I think it can't get much worse. I take my ticket to the cashier. She announces $34.63. Whooaa what. I grab a menu and open it up on the counter, and show her the chop is $12.95 not $14.95. She closes it and says the menu is wrong. She said ""every room has a sign that says notice of price change"". I did see a hand written sign on my way saying that. I assume the price on the menu is the new price, and regulars need to take notice of such. I asked why the waitress can't warn me of the typo on my menu. How about you mark out all prices and write in new ones? You really haven't raised your prices, at this point your just taking advantage of people at the register. She says, ""We'll have new menus in about three weeks"". Their menu is a white piece of printer paper. Black and white. Mine had color from food all over it, and was wrinkled like it was in the rain. With a printer paper menu, how do you not have new fresh clean menus every time. Lazy, that is how. Three weeks to print and copy a double sided sheet of paper. Here is what I think happens at Bros. They get there in the morning and cook like crazy. They cook the whole days worth, and wrap plastic over the metal pans. You order then they just reheat and serve. This is meat and three style but for a $14.95 plate with a famous stuff chop.  You think man $12.95 entree for lunch, oh well it is a famous chop, then charged $14.95 cause I didn't clarify that the price printed on the menu was the actual price. Now that I'm thinking about it I can't believe I paid it.

"3214 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"Three days after our first visit she was jonesin' for a shrimp po-boy so I called in an order to go.Also got the catfish bites (just to try their catfish) and a full slab of ribs.The catfish was delicious and a definite re-order.Now to the ribs: These are pork spare ribs, not silly little baby-backs. And you do indeed get the entire rack. I have had my fill twice and still have a couple left for a snack. The deal is that they do not cook ribs everyday. I guess they refrigerate them and heat them up when ordered. Still, they were very good. If one was lucky enough to get the strait off the smoker I imagine they would be excellent. Do not doubt me. I am not the guy who has never met a rib I didn't like. I'm very particular about what makes a good rib. Good ribs DO NOT fall off the bone. You actually take bites while holding them, caveman style. These ribs had just enough pull to them, even warmed over. They are not Memphis or Kansas City style.

"3214 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"ok, ok i was reminiscin' about my years in cashville and whether or not they were a total waste of my life, and ya know the real deal is that even if most of it was lame, just going to Breaux's and Rotier's a couple hundred times made it worth anything else that i can remember. The other reviews are surprisingly pro-hater for a spot like this, i mean come on guys if you even bother checking this place out there's a pretty good chance you'll like it. I guess all the OG's don't want to review it and blow up the spot for all the yuppies. maybe they're writing bad reviews to throw you a curve.

My old spot on Illinois next to the baseheads sounded like a pretty sweet option after pounding a massive plate of fried catfish or jambalaya, but i'll let you make the call. Sure it's not a place for bettys watching their calories, but i think that's kinda obvious by the time you see the building, which is also awesome. Anyways if you make it here you're stoked, period. Don't believe the anti-hype, this is the real deal, and that dude talking about heart-blackening stuff is a total wuss, don't even let that fade ya.

"3214 Charlotte AveNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"I really did enjoy my food at Bro's, when I finally got to eat there. Bro's does have posted hours, but don't bank on them too much. I think they are more like suggestions, or perhaps just a guide to when they may or may not be open. I know it's an idiosyncrasy typical of such places, but after diligently trying to eat there for the past year or so, I now just find it annoying. During the week, Bro's is only open until three, so if you work, just plan to go on a Friday when they are (mostly) open until seven.That issue aside, the gumbo was great, served with probably the best cornbread I've ever had. The rice is served on the side, so you add it yourself. Bro's has daily specials, but their fixed menu is limited, so if you're not keen on what they have that day, just try the gumbo. The night I went this happened to me, but five minutes after I ordered, the waitress added a crab and shrimp stew to the specials and I was a little miffed because I would have ordered that. I was even more miffed when someone else did and it looked fabulous. So before you order, ask if they have anything that's not listed on the board.
