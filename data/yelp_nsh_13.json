Now, it has seasoned chopped tomatoes with maybe sundried tomato paste. Either way, Panera isn't all that.It's super expensive for what you get. Sure, it might be a healthier alternative than others but there are so many other alternatives like Newks which serves the same type of food.

If you've been to a Panera before, I'll keep this review brief and say upfront that it's basically on par with any of their other locations.If you haven't been before, think of Panera as your typical cafe, in the same 'genre' of 'upscale fast food' as Cosi, Au Bon Pain, Starbucks, and the like. It's a very comfortable, relaxing place to grab a quick lunch, catch up with friends, or camp out with books and a laptop to get work done over a few hours. The wi-fi works great, and there's plenty of outlets if you need to bunker down for a while.The food at Panera is also pretty great, and pricing is a tad high but generally agreeable. The best option is the \"Pick Two,\" where you can combine a half-sandwich with a soup or salad to get the most variety out of the menu. I also love the quiches, though you have to get there before 11am for that. It's nice that they rotate their menu pretty frequently; I'll visit Panera every few weeks, and there's often a new addition or two to the menu.

There are just so many great spots in town to get a sammich, salad, and soup so I put 'ol Panera on the backburner.

All of the aboveIf you said, you're likely a brilliant mind and have earned the spot of being my one call if I was ever in a pinch during my appearance as a contestant on a gameshow that allows me to do so. Just sayin'. I felt a bit guilty since I'm hypersensitive about supporting local businesses year round and we're right in the middle of this Yelp Shops Local campaign, but this broad was craving som comforting soup and a little carbs. I was bored with what was in my pantry and I happened to be nearby at the Post Office to use the drive-up mailbox since apparently my mail carrier hasn't grasped the concept of picking up my mail but instead shoves my magazines and other parcel on top... sorry, that is a whole other Yelp review. So. I gave in. I pulled up in the drive-thru line as apparently I shared the same sentiment as everyone else in Nashville and I waited.

Question 2: So what do I suck up and do it for? Answer: A Mediterranean Veggie Sandwich, Iced Green Tea, and a cup of theBlack Bean Soup (along with a bag of chips and chunk of bread that came with my order)Question 3: And, you know what? Answer: It was damn tasty! I enjoyed each and every last bite. The experience as a whole was very positive. From the drive-thru line moving efficiently to the extremely friendly (but not in the annoying way) drive-thru service, this location is very good at what they do.

I realize to a lot of yelpers out there, it's not \"cool\" to review chain places. \u00a0I understand one location to the next is not often relevantly different, but I don't limit myself to only writing about the unique.This Panera location has one huge attribute: \u00a0a drive thru.It also has one huge downfall: \u00a0the drive thru.Parking here is scarce, I don't care when you go. \u00a0Years ago this parking lot connected to an alley in the back, and there was this overflow lot than Panera shared with Starbucks next door. \u00a0Alas, no more. \u00a0The alley now is separated from the Panera lot by concrete and medians, and when they're full, you are basically out of luck.It's a huge plus to be able to go thru a drive thru in this area and get a panini and soup for lunch rather than a burger and fries - and everybody knows it. \u00a0Their drive thru line will flow along the outer parking lot \"rim\" if you will, and folks scoping for parking will follow around and park adjacent to the drive thru lane of traffic squished (illegally) to the right. \u00a0Makes getting out that way a big hot mess if you're not in the actual drive-thru, warning.Also that overflow lot I mentioned from earlier? \u00a0If you circle the black the long way, it's still there, only now it's fenced and a Central Parking System pay $1 for 15 minutes. \u00a0And the wandering meter maid, trust me, she's close. \u00a0A little frustrating, but if you've got a hankering and no other choice, do it and just be careful in the alley - a little muddy and \"rutty.\"This Panera is one of the worst for finding seats during lunch, makes you glare at the folks taking up booths with their laptops and day's worth of reading all spread out when you're carrying a tray wandering. \u00a0But I get that Panera is open way more hours than just lunch, so they're allowed. \u00a0Just glaring...My only real Panera issue that I just recently figured out, and it's small... when you order your entree, a Pick 2 would be my norm, you see all the info about add a bakery treat for 99 cents. \u00a0In the small print that I just noticed, you have to buy a drink. \u00a0If you are opting to drink more water, as my doctor suggested I try - and it's been working pretty well for weight loss - you pay bakery treat retail.Now, I fully admit that drinking water for weight loss and adding a cookie is counter productive. \u00a0And I fully realize that restaurants make the hugest part of their profits on drink sales as opposed to the food. \u00a0But I swear I never noticed that caveat before - maybe it's just me.", "location": "\nFranklin, TN\n", "exp": " 299 reviews", "date": "2013-01-09"}, {"rating": "2.0", "name": "\nCathy B.\n", "review": "Great location, right across the street from Vandy.

The panini is on a nicely pressed piece of focaccia, and has ham, Swiss, sliced chicken breast, sweet and spicy pickles, and a really good chipotle mayo and sun-dried tomato ale mustard spread that makes this one of my favorite sandwiches here. The French Onion Soup is always really yummy, rich, and brothy. My only complaint is that they forget the little bag of seasoned croutons and cheese that go with it way too often. Come on, guys! This part is what makes it so good! The Asian Sesame Salad is simple, but one of my favorite salads. It has chicken breast, romaine lettuce, fresh cilantro, sliced almonds, sesame seeds, crispy wonton strips & \u00a0reduced-sugar Asian sesame vinaigrette. For the most part, I like this location fine for using the drive thru, but I would probably not choose to park and go in because the parking lot always seems to be chaotic and a high risk for a fender bender. The customer service is probably more of a 3.5 because of the above-mentioned missing croutons and cheese and a sense of being a little scattered at times.

We decided about 2 years ago this location was in the \"middle\" between both of our jobs, so we meet here. Worst part of that plan: parking. It is an utter nightmare and I am not exaggerating. They have a security/parking person onsite, but honestly they can't create more parking spaces....they only help you squeeze in when the spaces are taken and you have to park on a curb. It appears much of the Vandy crowd comes in for lunch, and that is wonderful for all of us because many of them walk. That also makes it incredibly crowded and nearly impossible to find a seat. What's worse is the few people who sit there for wi-fi usage while others wanting to eat lunch have to table stalk until they can sit and eat. My Sister orders the same sandwich and the mac n cheese every time. We love the bread, love the mac n cheese. I typically get the over priced Mozzarella and Tomato Panini with the greek salad - \u00a0the pick two combo, I do enjoy the sandwich but it is not loaded with cheese like you might find in a real sandwich shop. I do agree with some of the reviewers that the portions are small for the price, and the customer service is inconsistent. I expect to pay a little more if the food is organic, purchased in smaller portions or locally but this is a chain. As far as service goes: for about a year we knew several of the cashiers, they remembered us and some times our orders every time, but they have moved on, possibly graduated and moved into careers. Since then it has been hit or miss with service. We visited today and our cashier was incredibly friendly and engaging so that was a \"hit\" and deserves recognition. I do love Panera's Hazelnut coffee, I often stop in to a nearby Panera when out to enjoy one, their pastries are also delicious. I just won't go out of my way to come here.

If the service had been better (instead of virtually nonexistent) and the ambience less creepy, I'd give it a four. Well maybe that's not true, as we've had far better bento boxes. Perhaps this place has such a stellar reputation because of the Thai aspect that we didn't taste? Or perhaps it's really good Japanese for Tennessee. But I'm giving it three stars compared to a my overall Japanese experiences in life. Oh and the bento boxes are close to $15, which takes the price to two $$, not one.

Owners Bobby Pinson and his wife Lucy showed true southern hospitality by checking on the tables to get input from their customers. They also obviously have a passion for good country cookin'. I would officially put the quality right up there with the areas most popular meat&3's or country buffets. You can taste the love in the food. The staff was first class and you felt comfortable from the minute you walked in. Brandi had a meat&2 for $7.99. Chicken Casserole, Turnip Greens and Mac & Cheese. I had the buffet because I wanted to try all 3 of their entrees. Fried fish, Shepherd's pie & Chicken casserole. For my veggies I had turnip greens and corn. Listen people, this food tastes just like your mom or grandma would make when you come in for a visit. It's a feast of country home cooking. One of the biggest issues with \"home cooking\" places is that they often over-season their veggies. That's not the case here. Everything was very tasty and was not over-seasoned. The food was hot and fresh. My favorite of the entrees was the chicken casserole. 100% YUM. The others were terrific as well. My wife LOVED her plate. We also had corn bread (one of the best i've ever had) and rolls (like mommas) which were brought out in a basket and handed out by the server. She was precious. They serve their drinks in a red solo cup which oddly enough made me want to find a sharpie to put my name on it. There is also a cold bar with salad, slaw, pasta salad, potato salad, fruit etc. Lucy's is also a great bang for the buck. Meat&1 is $6.99. Meat&2 is $7.99. Meat&3 is $8.99. All you can eat is $12.99. You can also just get veggies and the cold bar for $7.99. What's for desert? The BANANA PUDDING caught me off guard. It is not the \"normal\" banana pudding with wafers and chunks of bananas. It's just pudding....and I was skeptical at first, but now I want a gallon of it. I also had Bobby's Dump Cake. A buttery cake topping over cherries, pineapples and other cobbler goodness. WOW. Rich and YUM. Do yourself a favor and go to Lucy's Country Cafe. Open 11-3 Mon-Friday. Bobby Pinson is a smash hit songwriter (toby keith, sugarland, rascal flatts) and a recording artist in Nashville which is why, i'm sure, he was inspired to do a \"Sing for your Supper\" on Wednesdays from 7-11 with Live Music by friends of Bobby and a dinner special for the guests (no buffet).

Sure the location is convenient and there aren't any similar options nearby, but if you're craving some Southern staples for a weekday lunch, either drive over to Arnold's or to Monell's if you want to do all you can eat. Rather than spending $13 on the buffet here, I would recommend you just set that money on fire, because that would honestly be a better use for it rather than wasting it on the food here. My husband and I decided to try this place using a Groupon, and while I'm happy we only paid for one of our meals, I still left feeling really disappointed.My dissatisfaction comes down to one thing: the food here isn't any good. It's starchy, stodgy, and generally very bland. Yes, I'll grant you that the potato salad was awesome, as were the mashed potatoes, but they were anomalies since they were essentially the only items that had any flavor. The three mains (country fried steak, chicken & dumplings, copperhead pasta) were gloopy messes that literally had no seasoning whatsoever. And it wasn't just me or my palate, since I observed another diner take a big bite of the dumplings and immediately screw his face up in displeasure. He then proceeded to dump a ton of salt & pepper on his plate, as that was probably the only way to make the stuff remotely palatable. The country fried steak came with a sawmill gravy that had the consistency, and the same flavor profile (or so I would imagine), of wallpaper glue. The other sides we tried were fine (fried okra was decent), but nothing special, and apart from the potato dishes there just was nothing very tasty or exciting... except for the coleslaw which had the mystical property of somehow REMOVING FLAVOR from your mouth!!! The much-lauded \"dump cake\" was piping hot, but also was so sweet. Bottom line is the food here is great if you need to limit your sodium intake, but bad if you want to avoid diabetes.Overall, this was just an incredibly bland and depressing dining experience... and I'll admit the atmosphere doesn't help either. It's very obvious you're eating in a bar, and honestly there's a reason why we visit bars at night... they look bleak and hollow during the harsh light of day. All that stale cigarette smoke won't help whet your appetite either. I will say that the people working at Lucy's were really friendly and cheerful, but no amount of smiling would counteract the gloomy vibe pervading this place (though it will bump you up to a 2-star review).

Chipotle is one of my favorite fast food chains. Healthy, fresh, we go all the time. However we always go to the Green Hills location, and they are a well-oiled machine. Fast, fresh, the long line moves quick.White Bridge Rd. is a different story.Clearly they just opened up. The build out is awful. There are mostly high top tables with the exception of maybe 2 or 3 regular height tables. First of all, some planner didn't think to realize a LOT of families go to chipotle and you can not put high chairs, boosters or small children at a high top table. Secondly, we went on a Friday night around 6. It was not busy yet, but several employees were congregating by the register on their cell phones. None of them cared to get back to work when customers walked in. The guy at the beginning of the line was a little slow, probably new, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. Again, employees (girls) still looking at their phones while we move thru the line. When we get to the cash register, she finally puts her phone in her pocket. We sit down. My bowl has raw f'ing chicken. The same chicken my kids just ate in their quesadilla. I took a picture I will share . At first I thought it was just chewy. It was mixed with the overcooked last batch and the \"fresh\" raw chicken in this batch. I thought I was going to vomit. Normally I would go to the manager and say something, but there didn't look to be an employee over the age of 20, it seemed pointless. What were they going to do? This manager needs to lay down the law and perhaps have a MOD on a Friday night. By the time we left it had developed a big line, I felt anxiety for them because the guy doing the beans and rice was slow as can be. Oh and did I mention there were two employees eating food at a table? If they are on break or whatever, sitting at a table eating and chit chatting looks awful when the line starts getting long. Completely unprofessional. You would never see this at the Green Hills location.Will NOT be back to this location. Just awful.

As a native Texan, I'm rather particular when it comes to good Mexican food. Nashville is pretty far north of the border, but I tried to go in with an open mind. After all, they had a great patio which looked perfect for drinking adult beverages.The interior looked pretty welcoming, but the employees sadly were not. There was no \"seat yourself\" sign and no hostess stand, so we weren't sure what to do. No one greeted us upon entry, so we had to track down a waiter and ask to be seated. One person seated us and gave us menus. Another person brought us chips and salsa. A third person asked for our drink order, which would have been an easier task had we been provided with a drink menu (we had to ask for that, too). While waiting 10-15 minutes for our waiter to come back and take our order, we saw several subsequent customers seat themselves, yet others were seated by various waiters/waitresses. Who knows. Our waiter apologized for the delay in taking our order, but still. Throughout the rest of the meal, we had other employees check on us more often than our waiter did.We started with some of their cheese dip (I was a little surprised that they didn't call it \"queso\", but whatever). The white cheese dip had great flavor, but was kind of runny. I liked the spiciness though. Too bad nobody ever came back to refill our chip basket, so we couldn't eat all of it.For my entree, I had the \"Parrillada Mar y Tierra,\" which is basically a surf and turf mixed grill. It consisted of steak, chicken breast, shrimp, fish fillet, and chorizo, served with a cheese quesadilla, rice, beans, tomatoes, and avocado slices. I kind of wanted the shrimp fajita nachos, but that seemed kind of redundant considering the aforementioned chips and dip.The quesadilla was tasty and cheesy, but uber greasy. The refried beans were really runny and had no flavor. As for the avocado slices, maybe I'm just lazy, but I was expecting them to be unpeeled. No, they just sliced a whole avocado and served it peel and all (no pit at least). Maybe they should have removed the produce sticker from the peel, which is yet another reason to peel the dang thing before you serve it.My steak had a nice sear, but was tough and chewy. A few bites were also REALLY salty. The chicken was razor thin, thinner than the fish fillet. It had a nice flavor, but was very dry. The shrimp had a nice sear and were cooked well. They were probably my favorite part of the dish. The fish was cooked well too. It was tender and flaky and tasty. The chorizo was incredibly greasy and had a weird mushy texture.

Our food came out piping hot and neatly presented! I have never seen nothing like that presentation! I enjoyed every bite of my food and the Agua de Horchata to go along with was tasty as well, but way too much cinnamon! Our waiter asked if we wanted dessert, usually we get our fave sopapilla, they have the best! But we were way too full.

I think that the trendy vibe is fun for people, and again the food is good for the most part, this location is packed with College students and Vandy employees as it is on 21st across from the medical center/college so location isn't hurting them if you are walking. Parking is a b*tch! small lot and arrive early as in 11am! Service is fast and typically friendly but the way the glass \"burrito station\" is set up and add in the background of a packed restaurant, it can be hard to hear when ordering the ingredients for your burrito. I repeated myself about 3 times as did the guy building my burrito, to the point we were both a bit irritated by the time it was done. Overall, I can see why people will frequent here, its easy, its fresh and convenient and maybe they are more comfortable with the price.

The server was the highlight of this experience, as she was pleasant, witty, and helpful with the order. I told her I was dining in, was given a number, and advised that the meal would be brought to my table.This is where things started falling apart. I walked over to the first table, and noticed it was very dirty, looked around and noticed most of the tables in my sight were dirty. I found one of the relatively clean tables, and placed the number holder on the table. Now, Im going to pause here to advise that the next part here will be gross, and somewhat graphic, but it was my experience. I also will admit that I am a somewhat fastidious person, and had previously worked in the food service industry, so I know of the warning signs of a below average restaurant.As I walked towards the bathroom, I noticed that the trash cans were overflowing, and noticed several more dirty tables. This had me rightfully concerned and I was somewhat apprehensive of the condition I would find the bathroom in....Again, this will be gross, and you might want to stop reading here.... If not, just know you were forewarned:The bathroom has one urinal, a handicapped stall, and one sink, near the urinal. Some crazy customer, or perhaps a disgruntled employee had deficated into and onto the lip of the urinal! After the initial shock of sering this, I quickly went to the handicapped stall, which while not covered in feces, was still covered in urine. I quickly decided I could hold it, but as is my custom before eating I went to wash my hands. I tried to avert my gaze as much as possible, but could feel it staring me down from the urinal... Once my hands were washed, I of course saw that the paper towel dispenser was empty... This left me no choice, but to pass the urinal again, to get to the stall and grab enough toilet paper to cover my hands enough to allow me to open the door. Which I had to assume was as filthy as the rest of the bathroom.Once clear of this little house of horror I looked toward my table to see my food had not arrived. I normally would have cancelled my order and left; but I was extremely hungry, in a hurry to finish some errands before getting back home, and trying to give a newly opened restaurant the benefit of doubt. I decided to give the nice girl at the counter a heads up on the bathroom situation when I noticed my meal cooling off to the side of the counter. As I grabbed for the tray, another, extremely disinterested employee, and probably the one that was supposed to bring me the tray, asked if I needed any silverware... I of course said yes, and tried to discreetly mention the bathroom as there was a line of new customers with in easy earshot, and I wasn't trying to put the place on blast. The rep, quickly interrupted me, \u00a0stating \"We'll get to it.\"The food was okay, it probably would have been better before it cooled off; however I could barely notice it as a couple more male patrons had walked out of the bathroom and were discussing the fecal disaster piece...In this time I had also noticed the plate my food was on was dirty as well, and that was when I got up and walked away. One star, only for the one good employee at the beginning of this horrible experience. My wife asked me why I didn't get a manager, and I responded that I just couldn't deal with telling a manager how to do their job correctly after going through so many examples of bad management. I was a Quality Assurance Engineer for years, and it was clear to me that this was more than just one bad or lazy employee, it was a poor system of managing employees.

The cashier guy didn't even give the obligatory \"Hi! How can I help you?\" He just stood there looking at as. We ordered and went to our table.Second: Food arrived and the Hummus Plate I always order showed up, but the hummus looked different and tasted different too - VERY SPICY! Which all this is fine, but I'm not a fan of spicy food, so when my fianc\u00e9 went to take it back in exchange for something else, the staff acted so annoyed with him. We ordered a sandwich instead. Third: Sandwich arrived looking delicious, but it came with a side of chips & salsa - not the side salad we ordered. When we mentioned to the waitress we had asked for the salad with the sandwich she just looked at us and said, \"Oh, yeah I thought you said chips & salsa.\" And she walked away. That was it. As though, ya get what ya get. I was pissed. I went BACK up to the registrar to get the chips & salsa replaced, which as you can imagine was a big ordeal I even asked such a thing!

That was, like, three years ago, though, so the useful bits of this review have to be sorted out of the larger legacy of secrets and shame.Let's get the boring stuff out of the way first: Bongo Java is a perfectly competent coffeehouse. They serve a very nice sweet iced tea (get the fruit tea if they have it), an excellent \"basic breakfast\" for a reasonable price, and some kind of insane coffee that I suspect is spiked with PCP or goofballs or Guatemalan Insanity Peppers or something because whenever I drink it I feel like I need to get into a shouting match with a hobo or wrestle a raccoon for ham scraps or something (no, I'm not a coffee wimp, you jerk, I drink the stuff as if the cold hand of Death itself was tugging at my laptop bag--but I swear there's some sort of bad juju in that coffee). They have wifi and places to sit and terrible music and snotty baristas, so yeah, it's a coffeehouse. Don't go on Saturday or Sunday mornings unless you're fond of waiting in line forever.What sets BJ (lord that's an unfortunate acronym) from other coffeehouses is the massive and well-populated porch, for which I forgive them most of their offenses. As others have noted, the patrons are mostly college-aged hipsters, as you might expect, but there's actually much more variance than that. There's a significant population of chess players who show up every so often to chain-smoke and punch the clock, providing a hypnotic ballet of strategy and vicarious nicotine intake. There are Vanderbilt grad students staring at their laptops in a concerted psychic effort to make their dissertations write themselves. There are off-duty baristas slouching about. And there's always one or two old guys hovering over the whole business. Given the general youth of the clientele, it's a bit strange to see them there all the time.Which leads me to my final point: Bongo Java, despite seeming to be an innocuous, inoffensive coffeehouse, is actually more similar to some kind of monstrous, kelp-besmirched sea creature that, krakenlike, winds its horrible tentacles around you and drags you down into its inky lair. Bongo Java doesn't want your money; it wants your SOUL. It wants you to remain on the porch forever, swilling coffee and talking about obscure movies. The signs are all there:Exhibit A) The business primarily serves an addictive substance (coffee)Exhibit B) This substance is commonly consumed with an additional addictive substance (nicotine)Exhibit C) The coffeeshop is a self-contained unit: since it serves food and drink, and since I suspect that the second floor of the converted house that contains it is still... a house, you could theoretically remain there indefinitelyExhibit D) You can find the same cast of characters there on any day of the week, at any time of the day or nightExhibit E) I strongly suspect that the old folks who can be found at all times on the porch are people who were lured in by Bongo Java and NEVER LEFTSo anyway, yeah. You should probably still go here, because the porch is nice and sunny and sometimes the cats from the neighboring houses come and visit.

But despite my own personal feelings, here are a few highlights. FOOD: Always fresh, never ONCE had a problem. All of their bagel bombs and sandwiches are nom-worthy and their daily soup specials are 90% of the time outstanding. You do sometimes get that eyebrow-raising one passing through. If you're not sure if you'll be a fan of the soup, they give you a free sample. My recommendations would be the Bongo Basic for breakfast (the hash browns are just....so....good), the turkey pesto wrap, the gobbler, the new chicken salad sandwich (with fresh dill!) or a bomb. Be careful with the toasted bread...I always manage to scrape up the roof of my mouth when I eat the toasted sandwiches. Is that just me? Do I have a defect? Oh, and they carry Las Paletas Gourmet Popsicles. Need I say more?COFFEE: I've never been a fan of coffee black. If I'm given the option of a latte, I'll take it. With that said, their Irish cream latte is my absolute favorite coffee drink. Not just here - anywhere. That's high praise, Bongo. Fido in Hillsboro Villiage just got rid of their Irish cream syrup, so Bongo is getting a lot more of my business now. This latte iced is - dare I say it - almost more delicious than its hotter version. SERVICE: I like what another reviewer wrote about the service here: maybe some people like being treated like crap. And that pretty much sums it up. Maybe it's because they get a tick-inducing mix of music industry execs and college students. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. But - befriend one barista and you gain the world. AMBIANCE: The music is pretty loud, and the selection is a serious hit-or-miss. When Passion Pit or the Beatles come on, I give a nod of approval. As much as I love Mew, I'd rather not sit through their album while trying to pound out a paper that's due the next morning. There are a lot of nooks and crannies in the back and one table upstairs that give plenty of privacy if desired.CROWD: This place is an exhibit of hipsters in their natural habitat. Usually they won't bother you if you don't bother them, but you'll stick out like the yuppie you try so hard to not be when you pull your PC out of your bright purple L.L. Bean backpack. I switched to a Mac and started carrying a dirty over sized messenger bag just to stop the staring. All right, I exaggerate, but only a little. The front porch has turned into a general smoking section now that Belmont banned smoking campus-wide. If you'd like to enjoy your coffee smoke free, I recommend sitting indoors. The crowd volume can be seriously overwhelming during peak *cough - school - cough* hours and seasons, so try visiting during the summer or school breaks; the crowd dwindles to an almost normal volume.If you prefer a certain noise or service level, maybe wait until your preferences change to try the food and coffee.

Although the pulled pork wasn't as smoky as it could have been, it was certainly smokier than I expected it to be. It was also seasoned well, but I would have liked some bark in the mix. The fried onions added a great crunchy texture, while the pimento cheese gave it a nice creaminess. The barbecue sauce was more like a bourbon-balsamic vinaigrette, and I liked that much better.Despite its all-beef patty, the Disco Demi is a far cry from the standard cheeseburger. It's got sharp cheddar, pickled onions, arugula, white truffle vinaigrette, and a rosemary demi glace on brioche. Yum! The beef patty was delicious with an awesome sear on it, and the melty sharp cheddar was a perfect pairing. The pickled onions and arugula gave this burger a good crunch and a great flavor.

I'm from Southern California where Asian restaurants are a dime a dozen and I was really skeptical about eating Korean food in the South, but the group I was with wanted to eat KBBQ so I went along with it. Upon walking in, I noted that it was pretty crowded and as expected, the service was a little slow as a result. The servers were really friendly though and looked like they genuinely wanted to make sure you have a good meal. Although my boyfriend and I are regular KBBQ eaters, his friend and girlfriend weren't so we decided order more marinated meat than non-marinated. I find that to truly enjoy KBBQ though, you should definitely stick with the non-marinated. We ordered servings of Bulgogi, Chicken, and the classic pork for the meats, and ordered the Seafood Pancake as an appetizer. The seafood pancake while tasty was really lacking in the ingredients. It was more filler than anything. I was quite happy with the side dishes though. They were tasty with my rice. The KBBQ itself was a little less satisfactory. I appreciate that they were going for authenticity with the coal grill but this means that you're going to have to cook your meat fast before the coals die out. I did not like this at all because towards the end, we simply just didn't have enough heat to cook our meat through fast enough. Because of this, we had a lot of downtime and our meal was a lot longer than expected. However, the flavor of the marinade itself wasn't too bad. I preferred the taste of the chicken over the bulgogi but in the end would really have preferred to eat non-marinated since the pork was delicious.

\u00a0I admit that I'm not a fan of the moldy stuff, but even so...it just didn't feel right to me at all. \u00a0AT THE VERY LEAST, this type of a \"polarizing\" ingredient that is not really visibly apparent should be called out on the menu -- no excuses. \u00a0I told her to take it back, but she was too \"nice\". \u00a0I have no doubt that it was fresh and well-prepared; if you're a huge bleu cheese fan you probably would love it. \u00a0But again, if you're going to monkeying around with something like chicken salad, please make sure that you clue everyone in!There were a few dessert selections in the case...a huge cheesecake brownie and something else -- carrot cake, I believe. \u00a0At the cash register were HUGE cookies that sounded great, but had the consistency of a very dry and stale biscuit. \u00a0If I want something sweet next time I go (and it will probably be soon,) I'll try one of the fresh made desserts in the case.The employees (probably the owners, but I'm not sure) were very friendly. \u00a0Judging from the people I saw there and its \"off-the-beaten-path\" location, it seems like there were mostly regulars that like to go there for a quiet lunch and would like to keep it that way. \u00a0We arrived at about 11:20...everything was hot and fresh, it was nice and quiet, and there was plenty of seating. \u00a0(And no senior citizens to speak of, if anyone of your party is phobic of them for whatever strange reason.) \u00a0If I find out that the seniors at the adjoining retirement home are getting this food every day, I think I'm going to make an early bird reservation for 2047 or so.[Credit cards accepted; $4 minimum.]", "location": "\nOrlando, FL\n", "exp": " 32 reviews", "date": "2010-07-14"}], "num_reviews": 2, "address": "\n            451 Ponder PlaceNashville, TN 37228\n        "}, {"rating": 3.5, "name": "Kabab Gyro", "phone": "6153857773", "url": "/biz/kabab-gyro-nashville", "reviews": [{"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nBecky M.\n", "review": "Great service.

Some of the rice was undercooked though so it was hard around the edges. The veg curry egg roll was different. Not as much curry flavor I expected which was kind of a bummer. The dipping sauce was almost honey-like in flavor but had a really watery consistency. Not like any Thai dipping sauce I've tried before. Not my favorite. And lastly, the pad Thai. This is where the other reviews come into play. The first couple bites seemed like your average Americanized pad Thai dish. It was alright. But some bites throughout tasted almost spoiled. The mung bean sprouts looked more like DUNG bean sprouts. (Budump chhhh! I'll be here all night, folks.

And this version was exceedingly bland. I always like it when there are green onions in my pad thai; there were none in this version. No tofu, but there is scrambled egg -- even for the vegetarian version. Admittedly, I asked for it mild. But I somehow sense that had I ordered it spicy, the only difference would be the addition of chiles, rather than more sauce. Rather than throw the rest of the order away, I saved it for home, where I made my own pad thai sauce. I had thankfully brought over a few bricks of tamarind paste during my move from the West Coast. I neglected to buy Thai fish sauce here -- so I had to make my version with soy sauce rather than fish sauce. Regardless, I ended up with a pad thai with flavor -- too bad I had to add the flavor myself.I also had the chicken with some sweet sauce. This I could not enjoy at all. I like sweet sauces with my meat dishes. But when the consistency of the sauce reminds me of snot...well, I'm sorry, even I have boundaries.

Now, if the buffet food looks like it's been sitting out too long, you can order off the menu too... the menu is hard to find and isn't very much beyond your typical Pad Thai, noodle-soup , or curry dishes with your choice of protein, but at least it's made fresh to order.

That said, lets break it down...Food on buffet line: Ranging from reasonably good to amazing, her prepared dishes are full of flavor, very approachable, and very well priced. They have really added their own flare to many of these dishes with some delicious variations on things you may find elsewhere. The shining stars for me: the curried tofu and the seaweed salad. The tofu is bursting with flavor and just enough heat. The seaweed salad is the best I have ever had because i so beautifully balances the sweet, sour, and heat. Food to order: This place reminds me of my grandmother's house, if my grandmother were Thai. If they have the ingredients, they can make it. That said, there is not a specific menu with all of the things people like to order. From soups to noodle dishes, they do it all. My recommendation? Keep a very close eye on other people in line. They may be ordering the dish that will rock your world, but unless you watch, you won't know it exists. I could live in their Tom Yum soup. Try the veggie dumplings. I think the Beatles put it best when they said, \"..had I looked the other way I might have never been aware, but as it is I'll dream of her tonight\"Patty's House Salad: Did you catch the article about it in the Scene? If not, allow me to blow your mind. Start the process by getting together a group of at least 4 to 6 people (the minimum and suggested maximum). Then call at least 2 days in advance and choose your meat, tofu, seafood, or whatever you want. Start preparing for an interactive feast. Patty comes out with somewhere in the neighborhood of 27 different ingredients. She then instructs you on how to fill a lettuce leaf appropriately some of every single ingredient and eat it in one bite. This was not a suggestion, but a requirement. You have to be willing to put absolutely everything into your wrap and stuff this gargantuan piece of loveliness into your mouth all at once. You will be glad of the challenge though, as each time you chew you get a different burst of flavor. This is genuine Thai family style. You spend most of your time walking around the table, stuffing food in your hand, then your mouth. You are strongly encouraged to go outside and walk around the block for fresh air from time to time. This allows things to settle a little so you can go back in for another round. Even though you will eat until you explode, it is SUPER FRESH and very light. Not that same old soul food coma afterward. The only downside is that it costs $30 per person. But with the amount of prep work and love that goes into this dish, it is totally worth it when you want to splurge a little and have one of the most incredible food experiences of your life. Market: A small but nice selection of Asian market items. The Gen Mai Cha (Green Tea with toasted rice) is a low grade, but super yummy and very cheap. Try the peanuts, coated in-house with honey, sesame seeds, and apparently something very addictive. There is a very nice assortment of curry pastes to play with and some very attractive Sake and tea sets. Don't forget to pick up a bottle of Sriracha while you're there. Everything is Miscellanea: \u00a0 The decor is a ton of fun. Super casual, but laced with Thai treasures. Each table has an amazing set of condiments to customize your dish to perfection. They definitely take care of their regulars, so loyalty pays off here. There are some amazing seasonal treats. Fall brings coconut custard in baby pumpkins. You eat the pumpkin with the custard and it is both adorable and delicious.

When I moved here from soCal 3 years ago, I constantly craved quality Mexican food that was plentiful back home. My two Mexican classmates (one from East LA and other from Fullerton) and I spent so much time and money looking for decent Mexican food in Nashville.After 6-8 months, we gave up on actual restaurant establishments throughout Nashville. They all catered to non-Hispanic clientele, substituted quality by slabbing beans and/or cheese, or were regularly devoid of customers overall (for good reason). Instead, the three of us tried EVERY Mexican food truck that we came across over the last three years. We were very religious about this. If one of us spot a Mexican food truck, we'd take note of the intersection and made sure we'd try it before the end of the week. I've eaten well over a dozen or two Mexican food trucks in Nashville over the years. One truck(s) came out consistently on top: Taqueria Express. I have two soCal Mexican friends to back that up (one of them surprisingly cooks very well).Even if several of these trucks populate the same block or two on Charlotte, Taqueria Express always had considerably more Hispanic customers. Even while waiting for my order, at least two or three cars would drive up, park, and place orders. This does not happen at other Mexican food trucks and I don't blame them: they're not as good as Taqueria Express.I'll be honest in stating that I've been disappointed by the rave reviews that a number of Mexican restaurant establishments have received on Yelp. That's why when it comes to ethnic foods in Nashville, I trust the crowding of ethnic customers more so than high scores on Yelp (ie Seoul Garden). Taqueria Express is another great example.Don't get me wrong, a few other Mexican food trucks will provide an item or two that will top Taqueria Express. Some tacos will be better found elsewhere, depending on your personal preference on the ratio and balance of various ingredients. But as a whole, the meats are more flavorful, more juicy, and remind me of the food I've eaten within 1 hour from the Mexican border.My personal favorite meats at Taqueria Express, in this exact order: 1 pollo (chicken), 2 pastor (spicy pork), and 3 beef (carne asada). I personally like the quesadillas, mulitas, sopes, and burritos.This is where my confusion lies. There are a small number of food trucks in Nashville called \"Taqueria Express\". With my limited Spanish (and their limited English), the employees have stated that these \"Taqueria Express\" trucks are from the same company. I'm not sure if they're all owned by one person who licenses out these trucks, if they're distributed as a franchise, or are jointly operated by the Mexican Mafia. If you look at the city licenses taped on each of these trucks, they're all registered with a slightly different name, address, or person. Yet the menu items are identical, the menu pictures are identical, the prices are similar, and if you ask the people who work there, they say they share the same recipes and ownership.I've asked each truck how many trucks are under the \"Taqueria Express\" company (my classmates have asked them in Spanish as well). Each truck has given a different number, whether it's 5, 6, 7, or 8, all in the greater Nashville area. My classmates and I have located, pinpointed, and eaten at exactly four of these Taqueria Express trucks. We have searched high and low for the remaining 1, 2, 3, or 4 trucks (your guess is good as mine). I'll post reviews of the three remaining Taqueria Express trucks (that I've found) on Yelp as well... I hope the Yelp gods and goddesses don't mind me copying and pasting since their food items are almost identical. ;-)I'm so happy to post this review--now I can finally check-in at Taqueria Express several times per week. I love the chicken quesadilla. Be warned though: a number of the non-English speaking customers will hand you their odd business cards for who knows what. I've collected a stack of business cards from other Mexican customers over the last 3 years. I have no idea what these businesses do. I don't speak enough Spanish and they don't speak enough English to explain to me what that's all about.Prices at the Charlotte location are a tiny bit higher than at the other three Taqueria Express locations.

The miso soup is great. Before the changeover, it was just broth and some scallions, but Oya's soup definitely has more substance. The new level of quality extends to the hibachi as well.

Of course we were seated right away.Oh, deja vu. \u00a0I felt walking into \u00a0the store, I was back in Colorado and never left, except when the employees started speaking. \u00a0They had a southern twang instead of a western drawl. \u00a0Our friend asked us if we remembered Cracker Barrel Tchotchkes!, (we lived many years in NYC), from \u00a0about 20 years ago . We all said yes, and felt the trinkets and \"collectibles\" were different and unique, now they seem too standardized and commercialized.Late Lunch, As always the food was well prepared, Plate of Biscuits and Corn bread, hot and delicious, actually tasted better than back in Colorado. I'm thinking the humidity in Nashville contributed to the extra texture and taste as well as the Southern Drawal.I ordered the Half lb burger (medium) with onion rings. It's a shame that restaurants now a day make it standard procedure to cook beef at least medium. \u00a0My preference with beef is medium rare. \u00a0Overall burger had a wonderful charred taste, the Onion rings, absolutely delicious, crunchy, huge and plentiful!!!My wife ordered country ham, potato cheese casserole, apple sauce, and Double Chocolate Fudge Coca-Cola\u00ae Cake. \u00a0It was the first time she tried the Coca Cola Cake. \u00a0She absolutely loved it. I have a feeling it's going to be one of her standard desserts now!! \u00a0She always picks Cracker Barrel restaurants to visit when we travel the states. \u00a0She says she knows a town is civilized if there is a Cracker Barrel Restaurant in that locale!!! Our friend Lori, ordered chicken spinach salad with vinaigrette dressing. \u00a0Also delicious as always.Forgot what my other friend ordered. \u00a0Overall we enjoyed our experience at Cracker Barrel restaurants. \u00a0The service and and servers did a good jobI rate Cracker Barrel restaurants by my wife's experience. \u00a0It's not my style of restaurant, nor is it my restaurant choice.

Honestly, the food was fantastic (some of the best prosciutto the hubs and I've ever had), the drinks were well-crafted (hello, Secret Garden cocktail), even our waitress (whose name escapes me) made sure we were well attended to. So, why the one-star rating, you ask? Well, it's simple, friends. Customer service and human decency go a LONG way.Basically, 16 of us dined this evening for my hubby's company holiday party. Several appetizers, entrees, and sides (and cocktails!) later, we racked up a $2000 tab and were well on our way to ordering desserts.Relevant sidenote: The hubs' boss is undergoing chemo treatments for a bout of cancer that has left him with a cold sensitivity, especially with the typical hair loss. When he put on a wool beanie in the restaurant to keep warm, he was immediately asked to remove it... which he did. When his family mentioned his condition and questioned the treatment from Catrina, the assistant manager, they were told he could wear it if he presented a doctors' note... or if we had given them previous notice so we could be accommodated elsewhere. (Out of sight, out of mind?)In short, what followed was shock/disbelief (can't say that I blame them) and the cops being called (huh?), and we were (all 16 of us) asked to leave.On our way out, my protective spouse asked the manager if we looked like criminals. To which he responded, \"the cops just patrol this area and decided to check in.\" Riiiight.So. I reiterate: Customer service and human decency go a LONG way.

Finally. I have waited for years to have dinner at Morton's. Thanks to a celebration dinner was served in the \"private\" Boardroom of this Church Street establishment. It was my first time in the building after Castner-Knott vacated it a couple of years ago (wink). Dinner started with a round of drinks that ranged from fine wines, water, sodas, coffee and few in the party had Blue Moon and Miller Lite. The Prime Ocean appetizer platters were served family style and included cold and baked seafood. I especially enjoyed baked scallops wrapped in bacon. They were perfectly cooked and simply flavored for memorable experience. The crusted baked Shrimp and Shrimp Cocktail was served by an amazing cocktail sauce that became a dip for the giant onion bun served. The Oysters Rockerfeller was okay, but nothing spectacular. The steamed lobster was tasteless and very chewy. The condiment offerings compensated for the overcooked lobster. The Caesar Salad and the Bibb Lettuce Salads were very large in portion. Each individual order could have and should have been shared. The steakhouse favorite, Caesar was served with very clean, cold, and crisp Romain and heavily coated with a \"just right\" traditional dressing. The anchovies were unnoticeable (as they should be). The generous sized Parmesan shavings seemed fresh and was mild in flavor. The two sliced croutons were well prepared and gave the nice crunch to the salad. The Bibb Lettuce Salad was easily at least ONE FULL HEAD of Bibb dressed with a sweet dressing. The Bibb was accented with some cheese and walnuts. I think that the two salads shared between four guests would be plentiful and give a balance of sweet and savory dressings. The server suggested the Cajun Ribeye that marinates for a lengthy time. However, I wanted to experience the simple majestic taste of Midwestern beef and ordered the Filet Mignon. The meat arrived cooked to a perfect medium (nice sear on the outside and warm red in the middle). It seems that the only seasoning was salt and pepper and the steak was wonderful. Of course, the meat was tender and melted like butter in my mouth. The sides were served up family style and just simple spoonful of a few was plenty to eat. The best side of the night were the Saut\u00e9ed Brussels Sprouts with bacon. They were a bit overcooked, but BS craze prevailed they were still very good. The Twice Baked Gratin was simply potatoes covered in cheese and bacon...and almost perfect. The Creamed Corn was sweet and creamed well with a mix of spice and some sausage for an average experience. The Grilled Asparagus were the very thick variety and required the sauce served with the dish...meh. The desserts were perfect as they were classic without being fussy. The Hot Chocolate Cake (saucy chocolate, molten lava) was certainly the best dessert with a scoop of H\u00e4agen-Dazs Vanilla Ice Cream. The richness of the chocolate was not overpowered by the sweetness that is typical with this dessert. It was very, very, very good. The Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e with the specks of vanilla bean was simply prepared, smooth, and mildly flavored...perfect. The Chocolate Mousse was European style which is not as sweet as American style...it, too, was perfect. The coffee was simple, nothing fancy, but was helpful between the various samplings of so many wonderful desserts. Our dinner part of 16 was served by a delightful server and she was assisted by a couple of other servers. The service was very good without being pretentious or too casual. Glasses were never empty. And, even better, conversations were never interrupted among the dinner guests, but plenty of interaction was shared between us and the server. The server knew how to work with us for three and half hours. Very cool.I wasn't impressed with ambiance of the place. It seemed to lack a sense of warmth that \"incandescent\" lights should provide.

I had never dined at Morton's before; I've made a run of all the high-end steakhouses in this city and across the US, but somehow Morton's slipped through the cracks. Shame on me. We started our meal with a cocktail. My wife's Lemon Drop was well made, it was the perfect balance of sweet and tart and the bartender obviously freshly squeezed the lemon juice, as there were bits of lemon pulp throughout the martini. I've never met a dirty martini I didn't like, and this one was no different. My martini had just enough olive juice and was so well-shaken it not only had ice shards, but the ice had almost started to refreeze before I got the martini. I hope the bartender had some insulated mixing tins because shaking a martini that much gets the hands cold rather quickly. We moved from cocktails into the appetizer. It was the only part of the meal that was not perfectly prepared. The scallops were underdone. I know, I know, scallops aren't supposed to be cooked til they're chewy, but there is done and not done. They obviously used too hot of a pan to sear the scallops...the outside was the perfect golden brown color, but because the temperature was too high the scallops browned before they were done. Scallops shouldn't still be cold in the middle when they make it to the table. I would almost think that perhaps Morton's used frozen scallops that hadn't quite thawed all the way. Thankfully the server noticed rather quickly my wife's reaction to her first bite and apologized and had the kitchen prepare us another order. The second time they were perfect. Our salads were excellent; my wife's Caesar wasn't overly dressed, a welcome change from most restaurants. I LOVED the Morton's Salad; I usually hate anchovies whole or chopped, but I loved them here. The creamy zing of the bleu cheese was the perfect complement to the salty anchovy. My wife and I each ordered the filet. Both my extra rare and her medium were perfectly prepared. I am sure that if I had a thermometer the centers of the steaks would've temped perfectly; kudos to Morton's. Even the high-end steakhouses struggle with extra rare sometimes. All too often a grill cook hears extra rare and either thinks the guest wants it seared, or the grill cook just cooks a normal \"rare\". Thankfully Morton's had no trouble. This was definitely the best filet I have had in Nashville. We finished our meal with the lava cake; paired with espresso it was a fittingly decadent end to our meal.

So once again I have to say, I have never eaten the traditional dinner at Morton's. \u00a0Morton's is where I go after a show at the Ryman or TPAC, to sit at their bar with their excellent and experienced bartenders, to enjoy their bar bites menu. \u00a0Though as always, I find great small plates a bug indicator of how good their big plates must be. \u00a0And the steak ALWAYS smells HEAVENLY coming from the kitchen.But here's pretty much a great night for me: a ballet, musical, opera, or play at TPAC, following by a stroll through downtown Nashville to end at the Morton's bar. \u00a0This all feels very NYC to me, and it's a really great, fun, and intimate date or catch-up time with a friend. \u00a0I've already professed my love of oysters and you can get them on the half shell at the bar. \u00a0I adore their crab cake BLTs and mini filet sandwiches. \u00a0These are great plates to share. \u00a0They change up the bites occasionally, and I've had a great salmon and lox-style flatbread here before. \u00a0You can order from the full menu at the bar as well (I've never done it but I've witnessed others do it). \u00a0But late in the evneing, sometimes a smaller yet decadent meal is called for. \u00a0Their drinks (from aforementioned fantastic bartenders) are perfectly prepared and always kept full if you so desire. \u00a0The bar is quieter, typically, and just a great place to be overall. \u00a0The large windows allow for great people watching as well, which again to me feels so New York. \u00a0This place has the old-boys-club kind of steakhouse feel while still being not so chain restaurant like (even though this place IS a chain) and I like that.The food is delicious, the service top-notch, and the setting classy...so grab a seat at the bar and give it a try!", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 299 reviews", "date": "2012-10-18"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nUncharteredNashville A.\n", "review": "The Bar Bites are available in the bar Sunday - Friday from open until 6:30 pm and then 9 pm to close and feature high end appetizer like variations of their normal dinner menu for a fraction of the price.

While the Crab Cake BLT had a little too much crab for my taste (a good problem to have), Cole loved it, specifically the quality and crispiness of the bacon. One tip if you try the BLT, order extra mayo, as the combination of the bread, crab, and bacon, can be a little on the dry side. The Filet Mignon sandwiches come on a soft sesame bun with a pile of perfectly cooked filet mignon and are as delicious as they sound and a steal for the $6 price.

They are simply amazing. They take great care to make it well - the ingredients are all very fresh and well worth the cost. For a fast-food Mexican place, it really is hard to beat. One thing to watch out for is the lady working the register isn't always the happiest person in the world. The owner is almost always there, which is nice - but that woman behind the register usually sours the experience for me a little.

Ay dios mios?! Huevos Rancheros for dinner?! Yes, please. I don't really remember the food except that it came out fast, was salty cheap and generally good.
