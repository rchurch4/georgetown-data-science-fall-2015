If I wasn't so hungry, the crab dip may have received a C- or even a D, but you know, hunger makes anything taste good. Besides, It's Dicks.

The premise is that your waiter, and the rest of the staff, gives you bad service and says cruel things on purpose. If you have a sense of humor and thick skin, it is a good time. I would definitely suggest going with a group of friends. They usually make \"hats\" out of butcher paper and write lewd, but funny, comments on them and it's always a good time when everybody is poking fun at each other while you eat. Don't be surprised if the food doesn't blow you away or if your bill is high. A few fried shrimp and some fries for $16? A bottle of beer for $6? It's not hard for two people to rack up a $50 meal for just average food. But, again, that isn't the point of Dick's and I would encourage anyone to go at least once just to see what it's all about.

We wanted something unhealthy, potentially greasy, and something that would satisfy this emptiness in our stomach. And all at once, we agreed, \"FIVE GUYS\".I ordered a Little Cheeseburger. But, don't be deceived by the title, the Little Burgers would be more than enough to fill you up--the difference between the Regular and the Little is just an extra meat patty. And I enjoy a little more balanced meat to vegetable ratio in my burger anyway. After ordering, they give you a number and you can wait until your number is called. \u00a0In the mean time, while my stomach was about to implode upon itself, we helped ourselves to the complimentary peanuts. Yes, peanuts. Huge tubs of peanuts and bags of peanuts line the restaurant and you are welcome to take as many peanuts as you like. We each quickly devoured a basket of peanuts.After a few minutes, they called my number and my lovely cheeseburger came out. The patties are always juicy (slightly greasy) but yummy. What I love about Five Guys though are the plethora of topping options and the detail to which you can customize them. For someone as picky as me, I really appreciate being able to customize every topping that is placed on the burger without getting weird judgmental looks from the guy behind the register as I describe that I want a cheeseburger with \"only onions\" meaning no ketchup, no mustard, no mayo. \u00a0And I love being able to pile on grilled mushrooms and green peppers. Overall, great flavors, my only complaint was the sogginess of the burger. \u00a0By the time I opened my burger (in the restaurant, no less), my hamburger buns seemed limp and lifeless, barely holding together the burger itself. I really wish they toasted their buns or somehow solved this problem so that they would really stand up to all of the toppings they cram inside.Their fries are pretty good too. They remind me a lot of Boardwalk Fries. You can get them cajun style or normal style. \u00a0The cajun style kind has a cool paprika-filled seasoning sprinkled over the fries that reminds me of Old Bay seasoning. Also, like with the Little Burgers, a \"Regular Fries\" will more than fill you and your dining partner up. Use caution if you want to order a \"Large Fries\" because it really is a heck of a lot of fries. \u00a0Even after coming in so hungry, we couldn't finish off the Large Fries we ordered. Again, my only complaint with the fries, if I had to make one, is that they seemed a little limp and soggy. Or some of them did.Suffice it to say, we left Five Guys plenty full and I would definitely return again when the craving for a cheeseburger becomes unbearable.Another word of warning: greasy floors. One of my pet peeves. \u00a0Wear shoes with traction, lest you slip and fall. Also, free 2-hour restaurant parking behind the building. Although, you unfortunately cannot enter the restaurant from the back entrance for \"security reasons\". Which, by the way, we found out the hard way as one of my friends let in someone who wanted to come in from the back and was then publicly admonished over the loud speaker that the back door is locked for security purposes.

The reviews are great and all (I mean, who am I to say I don't like reviews!), but the food can speak for itself.Let's just put it out there that 5 Guys is a go-to greasy burger joint, which is great when you're craving it. And yes, I was craving it. Oh, it's so simple--a streamlined menu of little burgers, regular burgers, and \"other stuff\" along with your choice of toppings make the decision process a breeze. There are peanuts to gorge yourself with as you wait for your food that is cooked literally behind the cashier. Personally, I've always gone for the little burger/cheeseburger, but not because I don't have appetite--these burgers are BIG(ish). The regular ones aren't much bigger, but they do have another meat patty.In terms of burger joints, 5 Guys is great. I almost always inhale the food, so I'm pretty sure that I enjoy my experience every time...I like that I can still taste the potato part of the fries (both cajun and regular). When you order these thick-cut fries, they give it to you in a paper bag and they're so generous with their fries, you could feed two with the regular size fries and four with the larger size. Side note: They also have a cup in the bag of fries, which I imagine in reality they use to scoop up the fries, but I like believe it's their way of saying, \"Hey a normal portion would fit in this dinky cup, but because I like you I just put it all in the bag.\" I like that I can have all the toppings I want on my burger, which for me is all of them. And, the food is quite fresh. The only problem is their bun, which really can't quite contain the explosion of goodness going on in between.

They're always all misshapen and you can tell that they were hand-pattied. The ingredients taste nice and fresh - if you get a burger with mayo and tomato, for example, the beef is hot and the condiments are fresh and cold and crisp. That's one thing that I definitely miss when I have exactly two minutes to eat and am forced into FastFoodLand for a burger - they always taste like they were made an hour or two ago. Taking ingredients away to ensure a fresh patty doesn't ever seem to do the trick either! Five Guys tastes like a delicious burger that your husband or friend (or anyone but you) just cooked on the grill outside and served up just the way you like it. Because you know food made by someone else is always better than something you had to do yourself.The only thing I really don't like about Five Guys so far is the excess. I know that we Americans are all about MORE MORE MORE and FAT FAT FAT, but seriously, no one needs a minimum of two patties on a burger. And when you order fries, they're like $3 and they fill the freaking bag to the brim with them - jumping and leaping joyously out of their little cardboard container.

Hmm...On this most recent order, I tried the Gourmet Veggie Club on whole wheat bread. I requested additional avocado spread, as I believe one can never have too many avocados!The sandwich was far bigger than I had expected, but not so large on taste. The provolone cheese was beyond overwhelming, and in my attempt to remove the excess cheese, I removed much of the avocado spread with it. This especially annoyed me since I had paid extra for the additional spread.While the wheat bread was better than the boring ol' white buns JJ's typically uses, it wasn't super fantastic either.Ultimately, for almost $8.00 for the sandwich alone, it could stand some improvement.One HUGE plus is delivery time. These guys are always lightning fast, which is unheard of in delivery world. For example, on the last order, I called it in at 2024. The delivery guy was at my door at 2040.

One being a 3 course option with your choice of any entree, appetizer and a choice of dessert for $50.00 ( not bad) and the 4th one was the same, just included with a glass of wine for like $65.00. We all chose the 3 course fro $50.00. Most of us got the fried calamari as an appetizer except for my boyfriend who got the caprese salad. For our main course choice, most of had a dish that I cannot recall the name though, it was lobster, clams and mussels over a creamy rossoto tossed in light tomato like broth.Our server in the beginning was prompt and our appetizer arrived within a reasonable amount of time, presented mouthwatering appealing and piled high with a generous amount of calamari. It turned out to be quite good, seasoned well and cooked perfectly though, nothing spectacular. I also had a bite of my bfs caprese and it tasted extremely fresh and flavorful.Our main coursed arrived a little bit longer than anticipated though when arrived, was presented beautifully! The lobster was much smaller than expected with most of the presentation being the shell. The clams and mussels were seasoned well, though still nothing spectacular especially considering the prices, I would have to say the best part of the meal was the creamy rossoto ( I usually try to steer clear of too much pasta, but the baby disappeared fast : ) . Everyone else enjoyed the main course for the most part, except for another cohort that got a clam like dish, that was pretty disappointed with it. Through out our dinner here, we were greeted and asked how everything was, from the extremely friendly lead chef there, which impressed us much.Finally for our dessert, they had a selection of mostly fruit based desserts that did not quite appeal to the most of us. Again, the chef came out again and we decided to ask him for his opinion of what to choose...man, was he in for something Lol like a red carpet we rolled out with over a 100 questions. Finally, he mentioned something he could make that was not currently on the menu and that would please all of us and it was....just just your typical Italian conoli desserts, yes.He said that it would take a bit longer to make being he would have to defrost the dough, though looking up at him like kids waiting for ice cream and not needing to be anywhere, we decided to wait.So we waited and waited. I am a big fan of desserts and will wait for good things however, this was just too long. Finally they arrived looking outstanding and decorated to an art! After biting in to it though, my first detection was it never defrosted completely and was cooked to for too long leaving my in hopes of not cracking my tooth. The filling though, was the only thing worthwhile breaking through the sacrifice and a matter a fact, it probably could have been award wining if the shell wasn't so tooth chipping hard. I really didn't want to say anything to the poor chef being he went out of his way, though I probably would have been better getting any other dessert.Overall, definitely mediocre Italian food that's overpriced because of the location.

From the beginning the waitress was telling us how it's the best burger she's ever eaten and how there's nothing on the menu she didn't like, but she obviously doesn't get out much. It was a pretty good burger but most definitely not the best I've ever had. I decided to try the garlic and cheese seasoned fries to go with my burger. It cost a little extra for them as opposed to their normal fries. The only difference I see in these fries and the normal ones were that they shook some kind of cheesy garlic seasoning on the fries, which doesn't really make them special and doesn't really justify the extra couple dollars, although they did taste okay. I also decided to try one of their special sauces, which cost an extra 75 cents. So they brought me out a little cup of this sauce, kind of like a barbecue bacon ketchup. It was actually pretty good, but they really don't give you enough of it. When I got my burger nothing was wrong so everything came out of the kitchen correct. It was pretty good but definitely not one of the best I have ever had like the waitress was saying. I might go back but it would have to be like a second or third choice kind of thing.

The food was good (mostly), however the service was crap! On just about every occasion the wait staff has been rude and uncaring about the service they are providing. For instance, when I went about a year ago with a friend/co-worker, the server was very quick to come and take our drink orders. However she rolled her eyes and huffed when we didn't immediately know what we wanted to eat...we'd only gotten seated 5min prior to her showing up. During this same dining experience, our \u00a0table order took 30min to get from the kitchen. Our seats weren't directly facing the kitchen, but I could see well enough inside the area to not the plates/baskets sitting out to be grabbed by the servers. Our order had been sitting out for at least 10-15min., so it was lukewarm by the time it got to us.My second experience occurred 8 months later, and just as bad! I went with a group of family and friends. We did have a large order, so we asked for a little more time, which was granted. 30min no one had come back to ask if we were ready, and our drink order that had been put in before hadn't arrived. After we did get out drinks and put in out food order, it took another 40min to get out order, which came back either wrong, missing parts, or both. When this was pointed out to the server, she went to the kitchen to get our things. Some stuff was brought out, and some wasn't. In fact, some of our food didn't get to us until the end of our meal, and when this fact was brought up to the wait staff, they pretty much shrugged and charged us anyway.I would definitely understand the screw-ups and long wait time during busy hours.

I was a long time fan of the chicken burgers, have had almost every one on the menu each one is a hefty serving and delivios now that I am not a meat eater, I opt for the Gardenburger. Red Robin will put pretty much any topping on your burger you have available, so dressing it up is easy. Wait....I am forgetting the bottomless steak fries! Yes, you can have bottomless fries for your entire visit! Although a single basket is typically enough, we have on occasion ordered a basket as an appetizer and you aren't charged extra. They have their own seasoning salt at each table as well that adds a bit of kick to them and is just salty enough too. Recently they changed some items on the menu but the staples are there, and they now have wraps and salads. You can order any burger or sandwich lettuce wrapped, and have melon as a side (cantaloupe is one of my faves!). They also started offering sweet potato fries for an up-charge, I ordered them and my first batch was cold, but the waitress kindly brought me a hot fresh order. They were okay, but nothing I would order again, I will stick with the steak fries next visit. The kids meal menu is one of the best I have experienced while eating out, they actually have options and side items that include healthy salads, oranges, carrots and melon and each are reasonably priced including a drink.

I've eaten in Greektown many many times. I have no idea what a 'Chicago-Style Gyro' is.* So, on one chilly Thursday evening, I found myself speeding up & down Gallatin with burgers on my mind. Traffic frustrated my pole position ways and during my stop, I spied CSG. I'd seen it many times and thought 'tonight is as good as a time to try' than ever so... I stopped in.I walked in and there weren't many people in the dining room. This is good & bad. Good because this (usually) means that the wait time will be minimized. Bad because empty restaurants sometimes come with a reason. I committed to drinking copious amounts with booze with my food (to kill anything that might try and kill me) and kept it moving. I asked the guy behind the counter what made the gyro Chicago-style. He mentioned something about the bread that I didn't quite catch/follow and at the risk of having him explain it again, I just decided to order. I ordered a combo plate. This came with chicken, gyro meat, rice, tabouleh salad, and pita.Everything was solid, if not ground-breaking. The chicken was served with ranch dressing, which made me give a side-eye. For reals? Ranch? I mean, ranch dressing *is* deliciously addicting... but... for reals? Ranch dressing? In an ethnic establishment? The side-eye was warranted. Thankfully, the gyro came with tzatziki. The meat was a bit saltier than my usual taste but when paired with the rice & pita, more than edible. Tabouleh can be an afterthought and this tabouleh was right on par with that trend... but it wasn't bad tasting. By the time I was done eating, I was full, satisfied, not in debt, and no where closer to understanding what a Chicago-style gyro was than when I stopped in.

First of all, the staff is very friendly and efficient, which is a great start when running through the drive-thru. They have the norm as far as the menu goes: gyros, kebabs, hummus, falafel, stuffed grape leaves, baklava, etc. While their menu looks like the rest of the places you might find on this stretch, the quality, presentation, consistency, and flavor are what make Chicago Style the best. I usually get the combo plate, which is a mix of gyro and chicken, taboulleh salad (they offer a side salad, but the taboulleh is fantastic), toasted pita, and dressing. The flavor and quality of the gyro is the best I've had anywhere in Nashville. They serve large slices, which is better than the dried out chippy pieces you often get at other places. The chicken is always fresh, tender and well seasoned. The only reason I gave them four stars is because of the rice. When everything is so good, the mediocre (at best) rice reminds me of the overcooked chicken flavored rice from the box, and seems like a mismatch for the other fresh, delicious flavors on the plate.

I've been to 45 of the 50 states. I've eaten a lot of really good food. I've also eaten a lot of mediocre food. As a food-lover and food blogger (lesleighmemmel.wordpress\u2026), when we moved to Nashville, my husband and I set out to find \"Nashville's Best BBQ.\"We found it.Drop what you're doing and get over to the Nashville Farmers Market. Well, first... finish reading my awesome review and then go check out my blog. ;)B & C Market BBQ, or \"Bacon & Caviar,\" is located in the \"food court\" of the Nashville Farmers Market. The menu is nothing more than handwritten chalk on a blackboard. You have choices of pulled pork, brisket, and chicken in form of \"plate\" or \"combo.\" They also have smoked salmon a few days of the week, as well as a few other specialty items. Standard southern side items. Fountain drinks and an array of different sauces.The pulled pork is incredible. Perfectly seasoned. Melts in your mouth. The chicken is awesome. A little spicy (which I love), and really tender. The brisket was a little fatty, but it's brisket. And it's awesome. Sides... I haven't tried them all, but everything's been really good. My favorite is the Creole slaw, which is basically just a mildly spicy cole slaw. The Mac 'n Cheese is great, but I love pretty much and kind of mac 'n cheese. Actually, I love cheese, in general. But I'm from Wisconsin, where cheese is its own food group...Go here.

I resent BBQ joints that try to avoid selling fries, because it generally suggests they are being too cheap to operate a fryer. The fries aren't a high point (really need to be thicker) but at placated my value sense. they really could stand to ditch the meat and three sides and go for something a bit more modern. Everybody does those same sides in Nashville, so it is hard to stand out, although they do experiment with the grits and egg rolls.They do tend to get a bit sluggish at lunchtime, due to popularity, and they could stand to have a bit more space or a more efficient layout. One person ordering something fried means an awkward standing customer in the narrow service area, for example.

After that, we go to order prime rib, and they are out of it. So, in a snotty tone, The waitress tells me the ribeye is the same and that I should have come earlier if I wanted the prime rib. What kind of steakhouse RUNS OUT OF STEAK??!!! So, I had to settle for the ribeye. The menu says the ribeye is \"extremely juicy\", well... I ordered mine as medium well. It comes out very well done, and at this point, I'm already highly irritated, to the frustration point of wanting to cuss someone out, so i tried to eat it. The mozzarella sticks were over seasoned, and as they bring my sister her plate, the waitress tells my dad that they are out of his Mashed Potatoes. It didnt stop there. I went to order a watermelon martini, and they are out of watermelon. At this point, I tell the waitress to just give me the check. For three people, the check was $67.92.

Actually, I wasn't so tempted by the Super Deluxe's size as I was by its fixins: loved the mushrooms, loved the grilled onions and jalapenos, and while I was a bit worried that the BBQ sauce was going to drown out the burger, they were quite conscious of that potential catastrophe and put just enough on. Also, the bacon actually tasted like bacon, which \u00a0you'd think wouldn't be asking for much, but a lot of burger joints don't seem to understand this fundamental concept.In spite of the burger's awesomeness, though, what I am still thinking about the most are those seasoned fries.

It is purely amazing that managers and owners of businesses that deal with the public fail to instruct their employees on the absolute neccessity of good customer service in the age of immediate online reviews and social media. Astounding, really. So here's the deal:The Kids spent a little time in the game room where my 10 year old daughter put 1 quarter in a game that took 2. She wanted her money back and hit the coin return lever, but nothing happened. She came to the table to tell me and I told her to tell the young lady at the counter...I was trying to teach her a lesson about asking for what you want and was certain she would experience a good lesson in customer service when she got her quarter back. T'was not to be. The girl at the counter said that since she only put 1 quarter in a 2 quarter game she could not get her money back unless she put another quarter in and pressed the coin return (Keep in mind that this was an older game that just starts without giving you the option the get your money back...But I digress). No biggie, no problem, I thought, I'll just put the other quarter in and let her play the game. So I put another quarter in, and...wait for it...nothing happened. I hit the coin return lever (remember, old game), and...wait for it...nothing happened. So now back to the counter to get 50 cents. No biggie, no problem, I thought, they will just give me the 2 quarters and we'll be on our way. Not yet...Now I have to face the same girl at the counter who proceeds to say, \"Well, did anyone else play the game between the time your daughter put her quarter in and the time you did (maybe 30 seconds)? No I said, there is no one else in there (the restaurant was nearly empty...I wonder why? There I go again: Digressing.) \"I just need my 50 cents\", I said. Finally she grudgingly hands it over, with an attitude. I decided to give her a little construcvtive feedback, so I say, \"Hey, you probably should have just given her her quarter back in the first place. I would have been good customer service, you know.\" \"Well\", she says, \"that's not our policy.\" Really?! She pulled the old, \"not our policy\" over a cool 25 cents. Brilliant.\"Ok\", I say, \"you have lost a customer as a result of your 'policy', be sure to let your manager know we won't be back.\" I get the kids from the game room to leave and as we're leaving I notice the girl talking to a slightly older guy in a plain white tee behind the counter and he's looking at me like I just took a dump in the middle of his restaurant. Oh great, I think, a 20 year old night manager at a pizza joint on a Monday: The very definition of 'a big fish in a small pond'. I look at him and say, \"Great customer service you have here. We will not be back, and rest assured I will be writing some online reviews of how poorly we were treated in your establishment.\" \"Well, that's against our policy, so you can write all the reviews you want.\" \"OK, I'll be sure to do that.

Your child basically put one quarter into the machine and tried to get another quarter from the cashier but the cashier told your daughter it takes two quarters to activate the machine. So basically you got upset because the employee did not give your daughter an extra quarter to play the machine. That's childish and selfish of you to try to ask your kid to get a quarter out of a restaurant. Just give your kid a quarter it's not a big deal.

If I remember correctly I have been here four times maybe more. Here's the deal it's the only place in the hotel out of the 15 restaurants that you can get alcohol and food after 10pm. \u00a0The catch is that they stop serving food at midnight and alcohol at 1am. This place is expensive. We ended up spending a lot I mean a lot of money in this place. They get you two Ways. The first way is they are located in the hotel so things are going to be more expensive. The second way is after 10 PM they're the only ones that have alcohol. The fuse bar and Grill in my opinion difficult to find if it's your first time staying at this hotel. I had to have an employee escort me to find the fuse bar. \u00a0This hotel is so massive. make sure that you have a map or ask somebody to bring you to this bar. The sign changes color constantly from green to red to blue and they have a bunch of TVs with every single game that you can imagine on with DirecTV. They do advertise this place has a nightclub. From the outside it does look like a club but once you get inside it just looks like modern bar. I did not see an area where there was a dance floor there was no live music or DJ playing. Fuse was reasonably full at lunch and from dinner to midnight the place was pretty packed. I did eat here two times for lunch in the food was good. I had a turkey club sandwich $18 that I could only half of. \u00a0The next day for lunch I had a chicken quesadilla appetizer that was a really good for $15. One of the nights here we got like six appetizers and I can't remember how many beers there was definitely more than 20 beers on the table at one point. I did notice when I ate here for launch that the staff seem to take forever to refill our drinks or to come back to the table. But the night when we had the six appetizers and all of the beers there was two people constantly coming to work table to remove drinks get us refills and we didn't have to ask anybody. \u00a0The one thing that I did enjoy here was their wings they did have pretty decent wings but there quesadilla was way better than the wings. If you were staying at the hotel just be prepared that it's going to be expensive and you're better off just going outside of the hotel to a sports bar. Overall I'm sure I will be back here next year the food was okay but very expensive the drinks were good and they had pretty much every sports game you could watch on television.

In a year (hopefully sooner), there will be more options for late(r) night quick eating Downtown but until there are, there's Caesar's. A staple of post-room service munchies at the local hotels, Caesar's has the pizza thing down to a science. On a Wednesday night that had me running from pillar to post, I needed food for the safety of all around me. Striking out nearly everywhere within a four-block radius, I went with Caesar's. A 10\" supreme pizza sounded just right. What did not sound just right were the fees associated with delivering it to my hotel. I saved nearly four dollars (not including the tip I'd had to give to the delivery guy) by hoofing it and picking it up myself. I understand that everyone has a bottom line and that businesses are in the practice of making money but when you've practically cornered the market, think of the future. When there are other choices around, brand familiarity might not be enough to keep you afloat.I picked the pie up, received a couple of grunts from the guys behind the counter, paid my money, and went off in to the night. The pizza was what you expected: cheesy, not-too-greasy, decently-adorned with pepperoni and the (standard) rest. It was enough to fill me up (of course I ate the whole thing; I hadn't eaten in eight hours) but it didn't send me in to flights of ecstasy.

I had hopes that this could be my neighborhood favorite, being such a huge fan of Mexican food and local eateries. Unfortunately my first experience was too sub-par to draw me back.The Staff were very friendly and accommodating. It was not busy for Saturday night dinner and everything hit the table in good time. None of this matters if the food is lacking and that was the unfortunate case.I ordered a plate of enchiladas. I love spicy food and requested they be made extra spicy. I explained that I wasn't concerned with how the spice was added (add jalapenos, spicier sauce, etc) and when the server seemed to understand my request I explained, \"whatever the kitchen feels will make it spicy and taste the best.\" I am confident there was no language barrier, which, to be honest can happen in a Mexican restaurant.What came out was bad. The tortillas were soggy and discolored, having been covered in a sauce that was absorbed by the tortillas and made mushy, like when you take leftovers home and re-heat them. Except they were cool. The chicken and steak inside were dry and bland. They had thrown some diced jalapeno into the mix inside, but just a little, providing no real spice and flavor. After attempting to choke them down for a moment I called the server over and asked for some hot salsa; not just for the heat but because they were so dry. She replied that the cook put jalapeno into them, but I explained it was not just for heat but also dryness. She brought back some spicier sauce and that was the end of it. Enchiladas are by definition something rolled in a corn tortilla and smothered in sauce. I really believe this was prepared well ahead of time with some war surgery attempted to make my more special order.Had it only been my meal, I may have been willing to pass this off as a bad first attempt at my \"special order\", but my son's child's meal was bad as well. The rice was very dry and tasteless. The quesadilla was not browned and very greasy. It was too mushy when I attempted to cut it for him. A quesadilla is at least supposed to attempt to be crunchy on the outside.If this had happened when they were very busy, I could rationalize the issues and try again. But they were not busy.

Let me begin with a caveat - the rating is not about the food (which was tasty and quite good). It instead belongs to the service and the experience. My friend and I arrive for our brunch reservation and are promptly seated. Our server doesn't greet us with any warmth, but this is hardly a must, as long as the service is good (which it was not). She takes our drink orders and returns a few minutes later asking us if we're ready. This is where the service takes a nose dive. We waited forty minutes for our food, and considering only one other table had not been served, this is an atrocious wait time. While we were waiting, our server stopped by to refill my water once, but never asked if I wanted more coffee - and I had to flag her down to do so. Mind you, there are three servers covering seven active tables - at one point my friend joked that the staff outnumbered the customers. I understand if it's crowded or busy - but it was neither crowded nor busy. Our food comes, and it's outstanding. By the way, the Fried Chicken biscuit is simply delightful - moist fried chicken, eggs, cheese and gravy all come together nicely on a flaky and thick biscuit (not dry at all!). My companion asks for butter...literally five minutes go by before we flag another server who brings it to us in 15 seconds. We ask for the check and a box for my leftovers - the girl takes another 5 minutes. And she doesn't even bring the box! I had to ask another guy working there for it. We did leave a tip, but frankly she didn't deserve one. When I asked about the validated parking, the hostess had no clue and directed me to the front desk (shouldn't you know about this?). The front desk folks gave me a validation ticket, but when we got back to the Pinnacle garage on 3rd and Demonbreun, the validation ticket took $2 off. But it was supposed to give us parking FOR $2. On their own website it says,\"Two Twenty * Two Parking Discounted parking is available at the Pinnacle Garage at Symphony Place (3rd Ave. and Demonbreun St.). We will provide guests with the option to purchase 2-hour parking for only $2.00.See map here. \"Sigh. So we had to pay $6 for a smidge over an hour of parking.Like I said, this is no reflection on the Country Music Hall of Fame nor the food at the Two Twenty Two.

However, when my 2 bean burritos and rice arrived, I was satisfied but not wowed over. There wasn't anything bad to report about the dish but I wouldn't be craving anything from my plate either. I will definitely come back for the margaritas and chips and salsa. I may even try another dish too because it's near my home.

True--this is the Americanized Mexican style restaurant. It is not authentico. However, it is very good in this class of Mexican fare. The new facility is much better than their original spot down the road. Pros: they have the best salsa in town. That is sort of my standard of these types of restaurant. If the salsa is bad--the rest of the chessy, beany stuff is bad. They have great salsa. Points go to beers as big as your head. The waitstaff is always friendly. Parking and getting into the place can be a little wonky. I usually park on the right side in the strip mall lot.Last time I was there, I found my new \"go-to\". The fajita nachos with chicken was very good. The chunks of chicken were tasty and the placement of beans and other toppings on each piece of tortilla was thoughtful and even. Most of the time at similar Mexican restaurants--this dish is just dumped on the plate and it is a gross mass of beans, meat, and stuff thrown together. This was visually pleasing and palatable. Tasted great.Cons: When it is crowded (like at dusk on a summertime weekend night)--the feng shui is fouled up in there. There isn't a good spot to wait on a table. If you get one of the seats by the door, you are constantly pulling your legs in as new customers come through the door and waitstaff weaves through the crowd to deliver food to the patio outside. Most people choose (or do so because there aren't enough seats) wait outside. The hostess gives you a little post-it note with a number on it and then they skip over some people and then realize later when the person comes in with their post-it and asks \"how come my number didn't get called?\"Overall--I like the place and when cheapie Mexican is on order--that is where I go.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 18 reviews", "date": "2011-05-25"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nJustin S.\n", "review": "One of the Best Authentic Mexican cuisine restaurants in Nashville.

The deductions would apply to service and lack thereof....but this review is about food. I am from Southern California, and have spent many summers in Mexico and grew up with a mix of Hispanic foods, made fresh from Abuelita's kitchen - I am picky. I dont like ground beef tacos at a Mexican Restaurant, I dont cover all of my food in \"queso\" like all of the people I hear ordering here in the South and I expect the food to have fresh ingredients. Las Maracas has some really good dishes, if you are willing to get over the urge to drowned everything in queso dip and red sauce. If you order a burrito, a taco and an enchilada - you arent going to see much difference in any of the items, they are all essentially, meat, cheese and tortilla with some variation in sauce. But if you order Carne Asada tacos with onion, cilantro and pico de gallo you get away from the norm and taste some flavors. Or maybe a pork dish, or a enchilada dish with green sauce....The Fajitas Especial de las Maracas are good, 4 meats; Shrimp, Beef ribs, Chicken and Chorizo all grilled up with fresh tomatoes, bell pepper, and onions. Delicious. This place is far from my border state but they have some good food, and the food isnt super expensive. Mexican food is basic fresh ingredients, it shouldnt cost $20 a plate unless you are ordering serious seafood, and lets face it this isnt a coastal town.

Quite simply it is: gross.I've lived in Southern California and love more authentic Mexican food. But this can be hard to get in the rest of the US, and I actually have nothing against and actually enjoy Americanized Mexican food too. Las Maracas utterly fails even in this category where the bar is pretty low.Seriously, Taco Bell is better. I'm not kidding. At least there you have some corporate engineered flavor and not *everything* is out of a can. The salsa was basically canned crushed tomatoes with I think a wee bit of chopped cilantro. I couldn't taste an onion to save my life, and definitely not a chile.We ordered standard enchilada, burrito, tamale entrees. They were pretty much horrible. Mystery meat, cheese that I think was just regular cheap white cheddar, not even jack or a Mexican blend, and two mysterious red sauces that completely lacked any flavor at all. I'm pretty sure they came right out of a can and that can was labeled \"tomato sauce\". Could you please at least buy the can labeled \"enchilada sauce\"?? It really did taste like bad pasta sauce. No spice, no flavor, no nothing. Tamales were dry and the pork was drier and tasteless. Again, covered in tomato sauce. There really is no excuse for this. Most Mexican and Americanized Mexican food is cheap by nature, which is the idea. Take cheap cuts of meat, corn and vegetables and make it taste good by adding in other cheap and tasty stuff like some spices, onions, garlic, and chiles, and using a bit of technique from mom like slow cooking your pork. Not hard. Throw a bunch of cheese on at the end for the American palate if you must. Why people eat at this place I really don't know.

Traffic was horrific, so I was too worried to pre book the tickets.

Tons of free parking was available in the Opry Mills Mall lot, which runs parallel to the Cumberland River. \u00a0It was dark and chilly when we were standing to board, but they had an area that was blocked off with an awning like set up, so the waiting to board wasn't too bad. The waiting was the biggest annoyance. Once we finally got on board, the buffet was waiting, nice and hot. The food is the only reason I'd give it two stars. The buffet consisted of a ton of vegetables, roasted potatoes, mashed potatoes, stuffing, turkey, and roast beef. They pulled the food and stopped carving the turkey and beef at 7:45. \u00a0So you could grub until you were miserably stuffed. And then there was dessert around 8:30... that consisted of peppermint cheesecake and a sugar cookie. The wait staff were all hard to understand.

My boyfriend and I went on a Monday night and at first were a little worried because when we look around all we saw was really OLD people, we were the youngest ones there and we were over dressed compared to everyone else. Before entering the boat, there is a person there taking pictures and we were able to take one infront of the General Jackson which I thought was pretty cool. When we actually entered onto the ship everyone spread out and it became more intimate for us. We took tons of pictures, the sun was starting to set it was just wonderful. The river was absolutly beautiful and the staff was very welcoming when entering the ship.  I found a waiter and ordered a bottle of white wine for my table to be there when we were ready to be seated. About an hour we were outside and on the upper deck having cocktails and watching the band that was playing. On a loud speaker they told everyone to enter the main dining room for dinner.The dining area was huge and looked very elegant! There was a large stage in the front with the curtain still up. \u00a0We shared the table with about 8 other people. This was nice because everyone was interacting with one another and we got to meet people from different places. When we got to our table our bottle of wine was warm, however, one of the servers realized that it was sitting there awhile and took it back and brought us a new one nice and cold. They poured us both glasses of wine and ice tea. They immediately brought us our salads and bread. I also noticed that there was a small menu on the table just in case you wanted to order more appetizers. The salad was very fresh and the dressing was very good. After salad was done they brought us dinner which was also very good but I think it could have been a little more hot. But this was understandable due to the fact there were tons of people to feed at one time. After dinner, we had about 30 mins to break away from the dinning area and they brought us to downtown Nashville where we were able to take even more pictures. The whole city lit up at night was just gorgeous and we went right under the bridge which was also lit up. When we went back into the dining area our dessert was already on the table. They forgot to bring my boyfriend and myself coffee and it was a pain to get them over to serve me. I also wanted to order Ammerato but before I had the chance to they have already walked away. During dessert the show started and it was excellent! They actually pulled my boyfriend on stage and made him do the funky chicken infront of everyone with the rest of the entertainment staff which was both hilarious and fun. We wound up having a great all together and is something you should do of you are visiting Nashville. The only complain I have is that the wait staff is very slow and rarely check up on you to see of you need anything and when they do come by the give you your food and leave quickly, if this is fix it definitely has the potential to reach 5 stars.", "location": "\nPalisades Park, NJ\n", "exp": " 239 reviews", "date": "2013-11-25"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nHaley L.\n", "review": "The buffet starts right when you board the boat, so if you come in a little later than 6:30 your food will be cold.

There's a show at the end of the night on your way back to the dock which I was very impressed with. The entertainment was amazing, it takes you all the way back to when country first began and had a great timeline that shows you best of country hits of each decade. The flow of the show was just perfect they did great, but the last 10minutes did seem to drag a little because your getting a little tired around ten.The downside was the drinks were crazy EXPENSIVE for a single beer of a local brewery. 14.50$ Whaaaat???? There insane to ask that much for a 16oz beer. The food was average not like mamas home cooking food and service a bit slow but very pleasant.

So, dinner is served. \u00a0BonelessChicken breast was so-so, boxed stuffing was extremely salty, small potatoes, broccoli and a slice of tomato. \u00a0My husband was one of the last still eating . \u00a0Boy was he surprised when the waiter grabbed the fork right out of his right hand! \u00a0The same waiter did this to the party behind us. \u00a0A glass of diet coke is $3.50 but it does include refills.Coffee was very good, and the Bunkin Chest Cake was enjoyable. \u00a0So, on with the show! \u00a0(Between dessert and the show you have an opportunity to go outside and view the downtown skyline at night. \u00a0Save for the nats, I hear this is beautiful). \u00a0Unfortunately, we did not get to see it, as we were one of the last tables to be served coffee and Bunkin cake. \u00a0The show was entertaining, covering the history of country music from the early years to modern day. \u00a0 The show is similar to what you would see on a cruise ship or at Disneyland. \u00a0 I always enjoy a show where they acknowledge anyone that has served our country - asking them to to stand while the entertainers sing \"Proud to be an American\" \u00a0Very touching, but somewhat annoying as \u00a050% - 80% of the servers sadly are not from this country.The waiter made it a point to ask us to stick around after the show as he would be back to say bye-bye (tip language, naturally). \u00a0After the show is over, one needs to climb 3 flights of steep stairs to get off the boat. \u00a0Many people complained. \u00a0The elderly and handicapped had a difficult time. \u00a0Some of the middle aged folks complained. \u00a0Disembarking is very strenuous, \u00a0 Again, an elevator is avaiable but you can imagine the crowd and the wait.To us, not worth the $90 per person. \u00a0For $720 , our table could have done so much more. \u00a0We will not be back.", "location": "\nLos Angeles, CA\n", "exp": " 6 reviews", "date": "2011-10-01"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nRICK C.\n", "review": "Had a great time, saw a great show \u00a0( country music U.S.A. ) and enjoyed a great meal.

Their turkey burger is also quite good. They chose a wheat roll for me on that one, which I wouldn't choose myself, but it worked out. The burgers come in a great deal of varieties, starting with the plain \"Wise\" burgers that come in 1/4 and 1/3 pound sizes. They tend to have a pretty decent seasoning mix, salty and spicy. There are also teriyaki burgers, black bean burgers, salmon burgers, and several other types, along with non-burger choices. The chicken tenders are surprisingly good. Their French fries are straight cut generic diner style fries. They are often fried perfectly, just like in a NJ diner, but once in a while they're soggy. They also have the biggest onion rings I've ever seen. I've been very impressed with the food. Very fair prices, too!Now on to some constructive criticism. The interior needs some work. They've got run down seating in long table format, which makes small parties awkward. Many of the chairs wobble. It is clean inside but could stand to be updated...the decor is very bargain basement. There is often garbage on the landing in the parking area. Also, the lady who calls your orders does so very quietly.

They also added some stools. The TV is gone (thankfully). They have always given me correct change, and we always get courteous service from the counter staff.

I got the Wayback burger (two patties with cheese) and they let you chose whatever toppings you want too. I wasn't into trying anything different so it was just fries for me to go with my burger. I paid about $10 so it was a bit cheaper than their competitor. Although it the store wasn't super busy it took a while for my food but I do appreciate having food cooked to order so it was hot and fresh. The bun was better than you average burger bread but it also wasn't pretenious like a brioche. The meat was juicy but had a weird texture (its real beef obviously), not sure if this was because a high fat content or what. My only complaint is there was no taste. I'm not say you need some crazy seasoning but a little salt and pepper would be nice. Fries were crisp and hot, what more can you ask for?

You can get anything from the Destroyer (ham, turkey, salami, roast beef) to a meatball sub, philly cheesesteak, or chicken sub. They have sandwiches made to order, but you can also build your own sandwich consisting of the wide array of toppings and condiments. Now, these are not little piddly sammies with 3 slices of meat on them. These are 8-inch man-sized sandwiches loaded up with meat, cheese and veggies on freshly-baked bread. For a smaller sandwich you can get the mini, which is 5 inches, and the biggest sandwich is 14 inches.You can get your sub steamed, but you can also order it cold or toasted. I tried the meatball sub toasted last time I was in and it was wonderful. You can order chips with your sandwich, as well as a cup of soup or pasta salad, and I highly recommend the broccoli cheese soup (it tastes like it might be homemade).

If I have in the past, it's so long ago I can't recall. But I did today!! \u00a0Let me start from the beginning: I tried this place for lunch today. Was seated fairly quickly by a polite hostess. All good so far. I took a look at the relatively limited menu, when compared to other Mex places like La Hacienda or Mazatlan. It took a full 10 minutes before anyone else acknowledged me. If they would have been busy, that wouldn't be a problem, but the servers were all gathered around the hostess station talking while I just kind of sat there. When my waitress finally did come up and take my order, it was pretty obvious to me that she wasn't completely comfortable in her job. Seemed new to food service altogether in my honest opinion. But, she was polite enough. Decided to order the steak Quesadilla, on the very first bite, I hit a \"meat\" chunk I couldn't chew. On my 4th bite, I hit what I could only describe as a brittle bone...that was it. Told the waitress I wanted the check. I didn't even want to fix the meal, just wanted to pay and get out. She said she would talk to her manager, who then came out. Miguel, I believe his name was. A nice guy, but he basically told me I was wrong and it couldn't be a bone in my food, because the meat they order doesn't have bones in it...?? So they must buy from those farms with boneless cows I guess. I realize that the product they buy is supposed to be bone free, but it's certainly still within the realm of possibility that a bone made its way through the process. What is scarier is that, if it wasn't a bone, then what the heck was it?!? In any case, he insisted that he make me a CHICKEN quesadilla to go. I figured ok what the heck. Took it to go and paid my $12.02 bill, leaving a $3 tip. \u00a0(that's for a quesadilla and iced tea).So I got home, thinking maybe I shouldn't write a bad review for this place. After all, as a rule I don't do Yelp reviews at all. But then I decided to try a couple bites of the chicken quesadilla just to see if it was any good. It was not great.

Last Sunday the boyfriend and I were too lazy to get out so we decided to try Taste of Italy since they delivered and had something to offer other than pizza. I went with the Italian club sandwich (minus hot peppers) with fries and he got the mild buffalo wings and fries. We were quoted a 20-30 min delivery time but it actually took almost an hour. My sandwich was really good! It was on yummy homemade bread and had a good amount of ham and turkey, lots of melted provolone, fresh tomatoes, and romain lettuce. (NOT shredded lettuce! Yay!) The bacon could be crispier. The fries were good but almost too salty to eat. My boyfriend liked his wings and also agreed that the fries were too salty. Here's where my annoyance sets in.... So tonight I stop by because even though It's only been 4 days, I'm already craving another Italian club sub! After I place my order I show the waitress my Yelp check in offer and she has to go \"ask her boss because she doesn't know about that.\" She comes back and proceeds to tell me they don't \"do that\" and the only discount they have is for senior citizens. I told her that her boss needs to contact Yelp so people won't be led to believe that they offer a discount if in fact they don't. I SHOULD have asked to speak to the manager to clarify the issue but after the day I had I simply wasn't in the mood to argue or debate over something that I shouldn't have to argue or debate over. The manager SHOULD have came out and explained their policy to me him(her)self. Anyway, while I was seated at a table waiting for my order I noticed a little card on the table encouraging people to check in and review them on Yelp. (See pic) Seriously, any other day I would have addressed this with the manager but sometimes you just know yourself well enough to know that it's probably best to let it go for now.

Wrong.We arrive and see that they are pretty busy, makes sense because it's Monday night. We wait by the hostess stand to be seated...and wait...and wait...until about 10 minutes go by I walk over to the \"to-go\" waitress and ask her if we seat ourselves.She says \"oh, we have a private event so seating is only available at the bar\". Sounds good, we make our way through a crowd that looks like they're having a private event and go to find a table. Every table, high top, etc. at the bar either has people at it or has trash all over it, waiting to be cleaned. So we end up picking a table that has least amount of garbage still on it and clean the table of ourselves.Fast forward to the meals. We had to remind our waitress about our appetizer, had to go retrieve our own silverware, and still had to wait for our food to come out.l way too long. \u00a0My grilled chicken sandwich comes out and you think it's going to be, I don't know, edible..right? Nope. The chicken breast was still raw. It takes is a solid 10 minutes to get the waitresses attention and she apologizes, I'm calm about it and not the screaming guy in the restaurant, not her fault-she didn't cook it. Everyone else I was with ends up finishing their meal as they go back to \"fix this issue\" which consists of seeing the manager taking the sandwich from her and going into the kitchen. 20 mins later our waitress comes back with the sandwich after she already came up and goes \"is your sandwich out yet?\". \u00a0No sign of the manager. The sandwich came out done this time, with the wrong sides on it, and a hand written \"SORRY!\" on the wax paper that lines the plate. Only the waitress had the decency to apologize for a raw chicken sandwich face to face. They did take the meal off of the total bill but what would it take to get the manager to talk to a concerned customer that already ate a bite of raw chicken? Me lose my mind and shout at people who's fault it was? Or was it the fact that they were so understaffed and poorly managed that they were doomed to have a bad night? (I heard another lady requesting the manager while I was waiting for my meal, looks like that person was spending all their time cleaning up the incompetency of other staff). \u00a0 I even had another staff member come over offering free samples with a name tag talking about a \"customer services expert\" or something. I don't want free samples, I just want to eat my sandwich I without the fear of getting salmonella.

Findley's is the Irish pub and is situated directly across from the sport's bar.This is a night for American Football, the padded up grid iron combat which dominates most drinking establishments. Tonight is no different - If you are wanting to watch the game, come on in. If you are wanting to escape the sports bar, this isn't it. As I sit at the bar, the Irish band sits flaccidly plucking their instruments, pining for a chance to roust the crowd. No luck tonight boys, the Red Tide is on the plasma and the bar is packed with old men reflecting on a youth long since past.Ah, now for the Guinness. The pour is a good try, with a 3/4 glass and then a pause. The challenge is that the 'tender is pouring with one eye over his shoulder spotting the score. The final may be closer to what you would find in Football Season in Dublin (that's soccer for the western crowd) - the final product is passable, but not passionate.If you need to stay within the resort area, this is decent.

We ate here last February when we were in town for a convention, and it was so good we wanted to return this year. I read some reviews that talk about lack of flavor. I don't see that, and neither did any of my friends. But then again we don't like super hot spicy food, just a touch of pepper for us. And this fits that bill. The salsa is the best I've had anywhere. Not super hot, but full of great flavor. Guacamole is right up there tied with the best 2 or 3, and you get a huge portion. Chips are not thin like I usually like them, but these chips are crunchy and fresh with a nice corn flavor, so I liked them. You only get a small bowl of salsa each (maybe 2 oz), and if you want more, you can buy three types plus chips. We did that last year, and I remember all 3 flavors were excellent. Ambiance was great; salsa music while sitting on the patio in the Opryland rain forest. Our server (forgot to ask her name) was a middle aged white lady with reddish hair, and she was very attentive, did a perfect job. (Manager, are you listening?) Food was out very promptly, but they weren't busy. Last year they were swamped, and we did wait a while. I got the green chili pork enchilada again, and my friend got the beef burrito. Both very good. Beans and rice were pretty good, but not the best I've eaten. We each had a classic margarita, which were very good, too. Maybe not the strongest I've ever had, but definitely not virgin like one reviewer surmised - I could feel my single drink when I got up to leave.

The waitress acted like she was doing a big favor by giving me free salsa (normal charge is 3 dollars). Yet she forgets to give us the chips. That took another five minutes (they were undercooked and therefore they were greasy and chewy). The cheesedip itself had good flavors and had a nice tone of cilantro but the salsa was nothing special. We both ordered fajitas (all three meats).

Horrible. Offensive. Gross. = La Hacienda on Bell Rd. Poop Smelling. Flies. Dirty tables. Horrible Waiters. Disgusting Food. No Service. (Just in case you're one of those people that look at the first couple lines of a Yelp)When we first walked in it smelled like someone had literally taken a crap at the door way. As a joke - i asked the guy in front of me if he crapped his pants but it was horrible. Still we tried to keep a good face and look (or smell) past the gross first impression. We got seating right away in the corner and the decor looked like everything that a Hacienda should have but then when i looked slowly at the windows and table there was dirty and at least two flies at our table trying to escape. That's what i did for the 10 min it took to get chips - catch flies. When the chips were put on the table the guy that seated us just dropped them off and didn't take our drinks or anything. We had to literally go up and tell them to give us something to drink after 6 mins of waiting. The waiter came over (the one that seated us, who had a horrible high and tight) and asked us for our order and when he brought it back they were the wrong drinks. We waited another 10 mins and had to go up to the counter again to ask if we could so kindly be asked for our meal order. It was ridiculous. The waiter then came over and tried to make a joke of the horrible service when we asked for hot sauce and more chips he said \"no...just kidding!\" Needless to say, he got horrible looks from the four of us. I'm gonna skip ahead and just mention why the next 30 mins were a waste of my life. 1. No chips or hot sauce/guacamole as requested for 15 min. 2. 20 min wait for food. 3. Different waiter switch with no warning then he disappeared and had to go up the counter agin. 4. All of us got different things which all were horrible tasting and tasted old. Carmones Rancheros (disgusting shrimp and bland spanish rice - no tortilla till we were done with our meal so i didn't even get to eat the meal with it), Chicken Burrito with Chicken Fajita meat - old chicken that tasted raw, Quesdilla was not memorable, Enchilada Supremo - hot sauce was just pure spice with no taste and road kill chicken5. No mid meal check in from the unknown disappearing waiters.6. No refills on drinks till we asked. 7. Gross sweet tea/ice tea8. Check never came so we had to ask yet again from another random waiter9. Unenthusiastic waiters who don't give a crap. Period. 10. When we told the counter about the horrible service, food and disgusting atmosphere he responded with \"..ok\"The ONLY GOOD THING that came out of going to that Hacienda was the cheap $3.36 gas down the street.

I also have heard from other people that have come in on non-holidays that they experienced poor service and food. With that, thinking it may have been a fluke and was an off-day for the restaurant, we came in with the intent to have a good time. With it taking 15 minutes to place our drink order (and we placed the food order at the same time) we were still ready to enjoy a great Mexican meal. When we received our drinks, we didn't see our waiter for another 45 minutes. No refills, no water, no more chips. He helped multiple tables around the restaurant, but not once stopped by to see if we were alright. As we were about to pay for the first round of drinks and leave our food came to the table. Mediocre at best, we had to call our waiter back as he was walking away to get more beverages. Waiter was rude as we placed drink orders for 2 of the 3 of us, then he began to walk away.
