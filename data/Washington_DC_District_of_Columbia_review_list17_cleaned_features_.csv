4.0,Excellent pizza - not cheap but very good indeed,"No wonder the place is packed. The pizza is excellent. The toppings very fresh and innovative. Beers cold. Salads and other dishes also solid. Staff and service swift and polite. Really very good indeed. But - a warming - this is not cheap pizza. This is expensive good pizza. If you are looking for cheap Pizza you should try any...

4.0,Good Pizza - But one of the BEST HAPPY HOUR'S in D.C.,"It is not actively advertised - but Pete's at all of their locations has half price drafts - Monday through Friday from 4:30 to 6:30 pm.
With high end brews from Bell's (Two Hearted) and other microbrews - it is an unreal value to be buying some of these beers at $2.50 per pint. This is cheaper than you can...

4.0,Pizza heaven and craft beer too!,"Can't speak for the pasta, but the pizzas here are among the best thin-crust versions we have ever experienced - all fresh ingredients and a helping of garlic to boost the flavor. To top it all, a good range of draft and bottled craft beers are on offer. The procedure is to order at the counter, receive your drinks and...

4.0,Primo Pizza and Italian food,"For what it is, a pizza restaurant with italian food, this was a home run. The pizza was great, the linguini with pest and shrimp was even better. They have a great selection of both pizza and italian dishes. Desserts were also yummy. The cannolis seemed more genuine (using my grandma's as the real deal. Not too sweet and slightly...

4.0,The best in DC,"Pete's has the best pizza crust in DC: crisp on the bottom, chewy on the inside, though not nearly as good as in New Haven or Naples. The plain cheese pizza is OK. The tomato sauce is good, but the cheese is too much of a thick, solid layer. The veggie slices (which seem to change from day to day)...

4.0,"Great Taste, Friendship Heights Neighborhood Gem","Pete's is a neighborhood hang out for us and many others. What's striking is the age range of customers that enjoys being here - babies to great, great grandparents. Every single thing in this restaurant is made in house (except cannoli shells and lady fingers) - that's the gelato, all desserts, soups, dough, etc. etc. The pizza is great, but...
