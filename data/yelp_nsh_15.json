Before starting this review, however, a bit about Bellevue. We are, in many ways, the pit of mediocre food. So when I hear of a pricier restaurant in the area, I am a bit leery. Maybe that is why it took me 7 years to try Bria?This was a date night for my wife and I. We started out with Copolla Rosso and an antipasto plate. I was curious about other wines, but the mix of wine types in the Rosso sounded interesting.The antipasto is a mix of goat cheese, feta cheese, some meats and olives and figs. The appetizer is a bit pricier than some places, but as one who loves quality deli meats, it was a treat. And a variety of olives is always nice.We then went to salads and since Bria is Italian, I had to go with the caprese. Wonderful mozzarella and local heirloom tomatoes with fresh basil and a light vinaigrette. The main dish was the best part. I had a pork chop with brodcolini and fingerling potatoes. The pork was cooked to a nice medium, so it had a decent texture and a wonderful taste. The fingerling potatoes were cooked so they still had a bit of texture. A bit of heaven on a plate. My only suggestion, which I told the manager, is \"go bold\" and go a bit more rare to give it an even better texture. I would consider 5 stars, but I am not sure it is the best of the best. It is great, but not quite \"The Catbird Seat\". Then again, it is not as pricey.We will be back.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 36 reviews", "date": "2015-08-12"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nSid N.\n", "review": "Bria is a great Italian place off of Hwy 100.

First, I loss the pre-game coin toss and had to foot the bill, second, it's a long drive from where I live in midtown, and third, I have been so disappointed with what passes for Italian cuisine since moving to Nashville, e.g. Demo's \"hey, let git some EYE-Tall-yun!\"When we arrived we were promptly seated at a tiny table right next to the Ladies restroom. Strike four. I requested a new table, and from there our experience went from one star to four.As many have commented, the bread was...puzzling. Certainly not Italian bread, meh at best. Now the good stuff. Our waiter was terrific. The antipasto was fabulous. Well balanced, great flavors - 5 stars. The bruschetta was very good as well, but not the best coupling with the antipasto (too much goat cheese between the two). I had the chicken \u00a0saltimbocca. Very good but a bit on the salty side for my taste. \u00a0Excellent presentation though. She had the spaghetti. It was a a home run. One of the few times I've had Nashville Italian pasta that was properly cooked, 5 stars. We skipped dessert. The space is nice, that atmosphere was cool as well - a very eclectic crowd, if weighted towards the Ye Olde Steakhouse set. I thought the pricing was fair - two apps, two entrees, about $50. As I mentioned, we skipped dessert, and didn't imbibe. Would I drive all the way out here again? Maybe. If someone insisted on Italian food.

I LOVE Italian and enjoy cooking it. However my 2 person $120 meal was very disappointing. Salads were good. We both had Caesars and the dressing was perfect. The crouton was awful! It was so large you had to cut it, (have you ever tried to cut a crouton!?) and was seasoned with Cajun spices so it ruined the flavor of the dressing. Needless to say I only had one. Veal saltimbocca was no good, the balsamic had not been reduced and made my eyes water. Speaking of balsamic, since WHEN does it include balsamic!?? If you add a twist to a traditional, easy to follow recipe, do it well! The meat was also not very tender, at least for veal. My chicken piccata was more tender. I had the piccata and again a failure at a traditional and easy to make dish. Prior to ordering I asked if the artichokes were fresh because I hate the taste of canned artichokes and a lot of places will add it to add the tart flavor. The Server told me they were so either he was pushing the sale or uneducated because they were not fresh. The sauce was literally a broth/gravy packet mixed with lemon juice. I'm really not trying to be negative but there's no denying it, it was watered down McCormick mix and lemon juice poured over seared (clearly not dredged) chicken then topped with capers, pickled artichokes, and tomatoes (WHY TOMATOES). Overall it tasted ok, but I ordered PICATTA not some Italian Frankenstein chicken. It really bothers me going to a nice Italian place only to see the dishes butchered by someone ruining easy recipes. Don't call it PICATTA if that's not what you're going to make!The service was acceptable and most guests around us were getting good service, us not so much. However we were not dressed appropriately and we often get judged because we are younger. The patrons around were getting good service.Dessert was another fail. Tiramisu. My bf liked it because he's not crazy about coffee, and there was NONE in this! If you like rum and mascarpone cheese, this is for you!! It's funny because the mascarpone was high quality but not prepared properly and there was no custard at all. I had two bites, but ray devoured it. Overall this reminds me of a place that does things their way, but not well. Italian is so good, and easy that it's frustrating to order something that should be relatively the same everywhere. I give it two stars because the service is good, atmosphere is wonderful, and wine selection is great! I would come again for drinks and apps, not for Italian food.

I have had several dishes, usually its a great experience. Varied menu, usually very good service, food. This weekend I ordered the 1/2 roasted chicken. I cut immediately into the thickest part to make sure its cooked through to the bone. It is NEVER ok to serve chicken that has blood in it. Ever. Period. It should never be a discussion with your customer. Take it back immediately, if served by mistake. Do not say \"Oh you just hit that vein\" when I cut into the thigh, see not only blood in the vein, but can press the meat and have blood surface in the flesh. You could have caused a serious bacterial infection in me or any other customer. Stop this! Train your cooks! Train your servers. Don't serve undercooked chicken!Roasted chicken is NOT smoked chicken that is sometimes pink inside because of the cooking process of smoking. Even smoked chicken that has pink meat has solidly cooked veins and no blood. Blood means it is NOT cooked all the way. Roasted chicken should not have blood in it. This is so fundamental to cooking roasted chicken that I can't comprehend how a restaurant usually as up to par as Bria could not only serve it, but defend it to their customer.I ordered Eggplant Parm to replace it, which came out fairly quickly, though it messed up the pace of dinner with my guest since they had been served and I sat and waited for a replacement. The server who brought the replaced dish also tried to say \"Oh you just hit that vein\" as though the cooks had been making this excuse to them for a while. One server commented that this happened before, that is often happens when the roasted chicken is served. I'm not sure what was worse, the bloody chicken or the wait staff telling me this was common, it was OK to eat, but they'd get me something else if I really wanted to send it back, or acting as if this was standard at Bria.If you've never had food poisoning from undercooked chicken, perhaps you don't know just how frickin' miserable it is to get, but I have had it from being served undercooked chicken on the bone that was supposedly roasted at a restaurant, and I know bloody chicken when I see it. The kitchen should not send this out, period. The wait staff should not be told to tell customers that \"Its ok, you just hit the vein, its OK to eat it.\" It is NOT ok to eat it. Chicken blood present mean undercooked chicken. That vein should be cooked solid with the rest of the chicken, and the meat coming away from the bone. That's when a chicken is cooked properly. If your chef or his line cooks don't know this, you have a bigger problem on your hands. I will be back to Bria because overall I like the place, the food is usually very good, but I won't order the roasted chicken again until I know that the owners and chef have addressed not only how to cook and serve chicken on the bone, but how to handle a customer when it is served undercooked. I was made to feel like I was complaining about something I should not be, that this was OK to eat, that this was OK and standard at Bria. If it is, it should not be. Two stars because I'm including previous visits that were good.

We are always seated and served quickly, yet not rushed. Ask for Josh...he is our favorite server...especially understanding and sweet with kids! They did not have kiddie cups so he improvised and made us some out of to go bowls with lids. Way to MacGyver it, Josh! You made our night! The only negative thing I can think of to say is that they do not offer a simple Chicken Parmesan entree.

For an Italian restaurant, they commit a pretty big sin. \u00a0They serve terrible bread with no character. \u00a0Really, it is pretty close to Pepperidge Farm french bread. \u00a0Now, I lived in the New York area and I do not expect Nashville restaurants to have Arthur Avenue bread, but there are some decent options. \u00a0After complaining several times, I brought in a couple of loaves of Bella Nashville bread to have with our meal and to let the manager try it and see the difference. \u00a0FYI, I am not affiliated with Bella Nashville. \u00a0Frankly, the Krogers across the street carries a nice ciabatta that is significantly better than the bread Bria normally serves. \u00a0Anyway, we asked the waitress to have the loaves heated up and then have the manager come over to try it with us. \u00a0Well, they brought us the warmed bread, but the manager REFUSED to come by the table. \u00a0Really. \u00a0Their bread may be a sin, but this incident is a mortal sin! \u00a0I have never been to a restaurant where the manager did not come to the table when asked. \u00a0If he did not want to try the bread, he at least should have had the guts to come to the table and tell us.It is clear that my experience is very much in line with other reviews here. \u00a0The management of this restaurant is doing their own thing and that does not include listening to or valuing their customers.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 22 reviews", "date": "2015-02-07"}, {"rating": "1.0", "name": "\nRebecca M.\n", "review": "We live in the neighborhood...no more than 5 mins down the road. Bria has been one of our very few neighborhood restaurants that we have frequented in the 4 years that we've lived here. Anyone who lives in this area knows that the choices are few and not so great. But, it's an adequate close to home option when we want to take the night off from cooking & don't want to drive in to Nashville.As far as ambiance goes, I'd give it 3 1/2 stars. It's cozy, reverberant (but not annoyingly so). I like seeing in to the kitchen and the wait staff has always been great. It's a quaint neighborhood spot.Food...well, we've had very good experiences and very bad experiences. I don't know if the fluctuation in quality has to do with who's cooking that night or who's managing, but it has a tendency to be a bit unreliable. Example 1 of several incidents; my husband sent his lasagna back because it was ice cold in the center (was it previously frozen? Certainly not made fresh). When it was returned to the table, it had been thoroughly heated through & a gob of cheese stuffed in to the empty hole where he had originally dished out. Was pretty lame & I was considering not returning. They were nice about it & credited our check. Alternately, after having not been in for a few months, the salmon entree that I ordered & the steak that my husband ordered were absolutely perfect. So, we added Bria back in to our main rotation again. Great, since it's literally around the corner from us.Well, our most recent visit has proven officially to be our last...and it really bums me out. We have kids...O Lord! We are one of those crazy couples who actually like to eat in public with our children. I know. Insane, right? Our very first visit to Bria, our daughter was just over a year old. We requested a high chair, but they informed us that they currently only had booster seats. It sounded as though maybe they might be getting a couple of high chairs at some point? The booster was definitely not ideal at the time & my (mommy) dining experience wasn't great since I had to keep a hand on her almost the entire time to keep her from falling out of the booster. Our first born girl is now about to turn 5 & she has a baby brother who's 6 months old & it's time to retire the infant carrier. During our last visit, I inquired about a high chair. Surprisingly, after all these years, still not a single high chair has been brought in. I commented to the manager that we wouldn't be able to come in anymore if we don't have somewhere for our little guy to sit. His response I quote almost verbatim: \"The owner doesn't have a problem with families coming in, he just doesn't want to encourage it.\"Absolutely speechless.On this last visit, sitting there eating, still blown away at what had just been communicated to us, in walks a family with a \"high chair\" aged child. The manager explained the \"only booster seat\" policy, watched the family stand there dumb founded for a few moments trying to figure out a way they might be able to work the seating out on their own. Then, defeat, and they left.Does the owner realize where he is? This is not some hoity toity restaurant in downtown. This is in a strip mall next to Subway & a guitar shop. This is a small neighborhood restaurant. Is he aware of the demographic? With what we have spent in Bria over these 4 years...and to know that our business isn't valued because we decided to procreate is preposterous. By the way, we frequent many of the hoity toity restaurants that Nashville has to offer (Etch, Rolf & Daughters, City House, Husk) & they all have high chairs and welcome our family. Tonight, we found a new semi neighborhood restaurant that will scratch our Italian itch. It's a bit more expensive, but the food fantastic & the wine selection sublime. 360 Wine Bistro welcomed our family with open arms & we can't wait to go back.", "location": "\nFranklin, TN\n", "exp": " 4 reviews", "date": "2015-01-07"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nCarrie H.\n", "review": "When I think pasta, I instantly want Bria.

I'm not so sure it wasn't the lasagna slipped to me by mistake. $20 or so. (Salads do not come with entrees, btw)My bf had the NY strip. He sliced off a bit for me and half of that was fat and gristle. What I placed in my mouth was very tough and still half gristle, unfortunately! It had a Gorgonzola sauce on top (I loved it, but you must REALLY LOVE Gorgonzola), so I couldn't tell if the meat had good flavor. BF said the entire steak was gristle and the Gorgonzola sauce was overpowering. $28 for a very poor cut of meat!Dessert:The tiramisu was odd. It was a glassful of flavored mascarpone with a couple of very hard cookies tossed at the bottom. And I think some swirls of cocoa. That's it. That's some lazy tiramisu!Service:Our server was helpful and friendly. The food runner was great fun!Bria has a nice wine selection and great atmosphere. I might give it another try sometime, but I won't ever, ever, ever be able to drag BF there again.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 23 reviews", "date": "2014-02-16"}, {"rating": "2.0", "name": "\nLadonna M.\n", "review": "Re: GLUTEN FREE_Not: Not really gluten-free though comes up under gluten-free in yelp.

Gee thanks for that information. About 10 minutes later he came back and said he was going to help us even though this wasn't his section. We ordered drinks and heard about the specials. He came back to deliver the bread and drinks then disappeared for another 10 minutes. When he eventually came back he said \"sorry but because were not in his section he forgot about us\"...Gee thanks again. We placed our order and off he went. The house salad was decent and brought to our table pretty quick. We felt better until he came back as we were finishing our salad and asked what we would like to order...Huh?

If I lived in the area I would venture back to sit at the bar and try the flatbread again.The BLAH - On the first visit to any Italian restaurant I always go for the lasagna. I figure if they know how to make flavorful lasagna they know what they are doing. If not - not worth going back. While the portion was big, it was bland - almost frozen lasagna meal bland. A couple of interesting things....First in a review here they said that they bake the bread. When we mentioned that we thought the bread was a little stale from being freshly baked he said that they buy it from Provence and nothing is done in house. When we overheard the table next to us ask about the Tiramisu the waiter said they get it from a local pastry chef in Nashville.

I love me a proper hoagie.Since there's no Jersey Mike's near me, I've been going to Subway and trying to figure out how to get a sandwich that tastes that good, and I'm always disappointed. No, I don't want it heated. No, I don't want mayo or mustard, and yes, I asked you to put the oil and vinegar right on the bread. I'm always disappointed but at least it's cheap. So today I stopped in to Jersey Mike's and was surprised to see the meat being sliced fresh for sandwiches, and that \"Jersey Mike style\" means lettuce, tomatoes and oil and vinegar. The meat was quality, and the cheese was actual cheese (Subway, do you really think that we believe those little half-circles are actual provolone cheese? I think not.)I got the Italian. They told me the bread dough is actually made in NJ and baked on premises. It tasted great. That was one awesome sandwich. Now, if they only had Tastycakes, and I could top off my meal with a jelly krimpet, it would be perfect.

The only thing saving it from the dreaded two-star rating is because of all the Mexican fastfood chains I've visited, this one is definitely the most veggie friendly, offering Tofu as one of the protein options. It's nice to see a place that sees vegetarian food as something more than just the absence of meat in all of their regular dishes.But the food itself just felt kind of lackluster. Maybe it's because we came in about 45 minutes before closing, but the atmosphere was just kind of dead and the food seemed kind of limp and far from fresh. My husband and I split an order of the nachos, and while I really appreciate that Moe's lets you pick and choose whatever toppings you like, the end result looked like something that had just been haphazardly slapped together by the guy behind the counter (not visually appetizing). I make better looking nachos at home, I'm afraid to say. Plus, while we opted to add on tofu to our nachos, I was a bit disappointed to find the tofu lukewarm and flavorless. Honestly, nothing but the pickled jalape\u00f1os tasted like much of anything. Also, the chips are apparently made fresh each day, but they really tasted like the super cheap tortilla chips you buy at the grocery store. Finally, the prices seem kind of high for what you get... $3 - $4 for a taco? Maybe I could see ordering them \u00e0 la carte if they were \u00a0less than $2 apiece, but at that price point, it ain't gonna happen. Our nachos came to $10.50, which also seems a bit expensive when all is said and done.I really wanted to like this place.

I'm always satisfied with my enormous burger. The Donelson location has been particularly good over the last year or so that I've frequented that location, but I've been happy eating from many, many locations all over Nashville. Mo's makes my favorite burger, period.Here's what you should know about some of the other comments from reviews listed here. I base this on eating at Mo's for more than a decade as my waistline can attest. Going there once, posting pictures and calling it dogfood is incorrect.1) Yes, their locations are often repurposed old fast food restaurants. Personally, I'm happy to see a building being used as opposed to vacant and I'm always happy to find a Mo's. At this point, after years of frequenting Mo's, a brand new building would just feel too weird. Their food has never been suspect and I have never felt the old buildings were a danger to my health. 2) It's turkey bacon. The owners of Fat Mo's are from Iran. Lovely people, I've met one of them. Guess what? Theres no pork products on their menu. There's a reason for that. If you don't like turkey bacon (I've always thought it was fine, but I'm not a bacon nut) ask them to leave it off. They're happy to do special orders.3) If I were to give them some constructive criticism, it would be their menu is a little busy. Their locations have had the same over-choked menu for years and that must mean people eat all kinds of items from a Mo's. I have strayed and enjoyed their fried chicken sandwich on occasion but am content to eat burgers from a burger place.4) I find their patties to be well seasoned and juicy. I have never had a bland burger from Mo's. They use some kind of mediterranean spice mix. The flavor of their meat has been second to none..to my taste. I have never recieved cold food from Mo's.5) Most important! It takes them time to make your food. They do not make burgers and have them sitting under lamps waiting to throw in bags. I have waited in the drive through for 15 minutes or more for large orders. I am fine with this. I will wait for good food.

The restaurant is located in what looks like an old KFC maybe? We didn't go inside, but instead used the drive thru. The drive thru menu is located at the back of the building. There isn't an order box there. You have to look over the menu & then drive around to the pickup window to place your order. At the order/pickup window they also have the picture of the combos they have available. I decided on the \"Fat Mo's deluxe\" that is touted as 16 ounces. It comes with mushrooms, onions, cheese, \"bacon\", lettuce, ketchup & maybe other stuff. I ordered no onions & spicy fries & a diet Pepsi. The combo is $9.99. The woman working the drive thru window was fast and efficient, but not very friendly. It took about ten minutes get the food. \u00a0We drove home, which is about 7 minutes away and got the food out of the to go container. The weight of burger and fries was a LOT. I actually weighed my burger and it was 19 ounces! I had to cut it in half and eat only half at first. The seasoned fries were good, but just tasted like the regular kind of frozen fries you can buy at the grocery store. The deluxe burger: this thing is massive. Like I said, I weighed it and it 19 ounces. The burger is two large patties. The patties are thick, and look to be preformed patties. They have been peppered, but other than that they don't have much seasoning or flavor. The mushrooms were from a can. The \"bacon\" is not bacon. It might look like bacon but it's some type of preformed, smoked meat item to simulate bacon. It looks like the Beggin' Strips that people feed dogs. I had to take the \"bacon\" off the burger. Overall I wasn't that impressed with Fat Mo's. The burger was large, yes, but there wasn't anything special about it. The \"bacon\" was gross. Would I go back again?

Koto Sushi Bar is located downtown and just a few blocks away from the theater, so we decided to give it a go.When we arrived we were seated right away, but within 10 minutes the place filled up with people going to see the same show. There appeared to be only one waitress for all the tables and I felt bad for her because that's just way too many customers for one lady. Probably because of this, the service was slow. Later on in the evening a different lady came out from the kitchen to help with the rush of customers.The night was cold so for starters we ordered some hot sake and a pickle plate. The pickles took a very long time to arrive at our table, considering they are cold and just have to be plopped on the plate. Because of the odd timing the sake arrived way before the pickles. Oy. Anyway, the pickles themselves were quite enjoyable. They had a good crunch and strong vinegar flavor.For dinner we ordered four rolls: Dragon roll, Yummie roll, crunchy shrimp, and the salmon skin roll. I also ordered some sea urchin because I love the stuff. When the food came I was slightly disappointed right off the bat. Appearance and presentation is an integral part of the sushi dining experience, but their rolls were just NOT PRETTY. It appeared that they took no time in making their sushi look delightful and perfect. The rolls looked mangled and the pieces were all different sizes. One sea urchin looked pretty and one was horribly ugly and kept falling over. The end pieces on all of the rolls were also ugly and did not contain much filling at all.Besides the presentation, the sushi was just ok. It didn't wow me but it was passable. The salmon skin was over cooked making it very hard in spots. I felt like the crab topping on the Yummie roll needed something else: mayo, spice, avocado? Just something. The only thing that Steve and I agreed on was that the crunchy shrimp was quite good.Overall, I wasn't impressed with Koto.

Walking into Koto feels a lot like what I would imagine it feels like to walk into a charming little sushi bar in Japan. The place isn't very big, and the decorations definitely give off a quaint Japanese vibe, though not in a cheesy way. The atmosphere is really nice, and the only thing that detracts from the ambiance is the tv they have up on the wall, which seems unnecessary and is a bit of a mood killer. Also, I definitely noticed a distinct \"fish\" smell when we walked in, and while it wasn't enough to deter us, I have to say that it was a bit offputting because I've never noticed this issue with any of the other sushi places I've tried in Nashville. Given that so many people have praised how fresh the fish is here, I was a surprised by the pungent odor, but I have to say that despite the scent, we had no issues with the freshness or quality of our meal.Another thing that surprised me was how CHEAP the food was! Most of the rolls were in the $4 range, and even the appetizers were very reasonable. We got an order of gyoza, and for $4 and some change, we got six succulent dumplings. As for the rolls themselves, I did NOT feel like the selection was very interesting or creative: most rolls were just one kind of fish wrapped in nori and rice with some avocado, cucumber, egg, burdock root, or scallions. Nothing wrong with this because the flavors were very clean and the simple ingredients really let the ingredients shine. BUT if you're used to places that put fruit in their sushi or have 5 or 6 ingredients in each roll, you might find the choices here a bit pedestrian and underwhelming. I did feel that while the flavors were really good here, part of why the rolls might be less expensive is because they are definitely on the smaller side and they do include fewer ingredients. Also, visually, they weren't as appealing or impressive as the sushi at Samurai - the rolls didn't seem as cleanly executed, and even our spider roll didn't have the visual impact of the one at Samurai (no little soft-shell crab legs peeking out to look like spider legs!). I have a feeling that the sushi here might be more authentic (not having had sushi in Japan, I can't say), so I think it might be unfair to compare it to a place like Samurai; both places are very good in their own rights, they just do different things. I was definitely excited to see that under their nigiri options that they had lots of unusual options listed that are very traditional but are generally not offered at most Japanese restaurants in town. Unfortunately, when I tried to order the toro (fatty tuna) I was told they were out, and that apparently they might not have that any more. Some other people tried to order various items and were also told they didn't have them... in that case, I think it might make more sense to have a specials board where you list what options are available daily for nigiri to minimize ordering disappointment! We had to swap in unagi (eel) instead, and it was really delicious, but I had my heart set on the tuna!Although Koto sushi didn't change my mind about my favorite spot for sushi in Nashville, it still was a solid dining experience, and I could definitely see coming here on nights when I didn't feel like braving the crowds at Samurai. It's a different style of sushi and a different vibe, so for those looking to compare the two, just know that they could not be more different! (About the only thing the two have in common is bad parking options!) Using that as my baseline I would say that I found Koto's sushi to be less exciting and original, but most rolls were about half the price of the rolls at Samurai \u00a0(but maybe smaller portions as well). Koto also appears to offer other Japanese fare apart from sushi, so perhaps the next time I'm craving tempura or some udon, I'll check this place out!", "location": "\nToronto, Canada\n", "exp": " 136 reviews", "date": "2012-02-03"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nScot A.\n", "review": "I have passed by this place on my way to and from work every day for the past 3-1/2 years. I have been meaning to try it for quite some time as I am a huge sushi fan.

It feels cozy with nice traditional decor with a slightly modern twist. It offers a decent choice of intimate booths, tables or sushi bar seats to choose from. Everything appeared to be well maintained and clean, including the bathrooms. Staff was attentive and friendly, but not overly so.My visit was during peak lunch time. The place was comfortably full, but I had no problem sliding up to the sushi bar. I ordered the lunch special for $8.95 which included salad, miso soup, white rice and a crunchy shrimp roll. I added shrimp/veggie tempura for $.75 extra. Overall, the quality and amount of food was good -- a solid sushi lunch special for the money. I also ordered the unsweet iced tea and it was good, brewed tea. I am picky about my tea. Some places serve rancid tasting tea or pre-made stuff.I did however experience one major \u00a0issue. As soon as I walked in the door, a major allergy attack was triggered. I began sneezing incessantly, my nose began to run and my eyes started itching like crazy. I looked around and noticed that they had several fans (the kind you use to dry wet floors) blowing air around the restaurant. Over the sushi bar is a decorative roof, and the ceiling is paneled with rice paper. Since we are coming off of a major allergy season, I am thinking there may be allergens and dust piled up on the roof and rice paper which the fans are circulating all around the restaurant. I got back to the office and have been miserable the rest of the day with the worst allergy attack I have had in quite some time. I think my clothes and body are still covered with whatever was in the restaurant. I can't wait to get home and take a shower. I would recommend that they deep clean all of their decor, turn off the fans and run an air purifier to clean out the allergens in that place.Overall, the food and service were good for a sushi restaurant in Nashville. Great little place for a quality lunch at a decent value for those of us who work downtown. However, if you are an allergy sufferer like me, beware of the issues I mentioned above.

When we got there one girl was working the register. Her name was Chasity and she looked as happy to be there as someone waiting at the DMV. She took our order. Handed us a buzzer and she was done. Maybe she was mad because there were about 50 people in line and she was the only person on the register.

They served terrible food, for sure, but at least it could be called food. This place served, optimistically, the residue of alien life forms.One thing you need to know up front is that I made two key mistakes prior to coming here. First, I ignored the bad-to-mediocre reviews of this place on every site because of its alluringly dirt-cheap prices. Second, more importantly, I chose to believe that the \u00a0gross, off-color photos of various dishes were a result of poor photography, and that the real dishes would be at least acceptable. That has certainly been the case at other cheap restaurants. My optimism persisted at the counter, where a friendly lady told me that my Chicken Chow Mein (I know, I was really pushing the culinary limits with this one) lunch special, complete with fried rice and wanton soup, was a mere $5.19 including tax. Wow! Unfortunately, I didn't compute the true cost of $7.38 since I failed to incorporate the cost of the 2 McDoubles I had to order later after I threw most of my food in the garbage.So, in a relatively timely fashion, the lady brings out a plate of food items, with everything in concealing styrofoam packaging. I began with my soup, which was mediocre at best and had a strange aftertaste. It was a solidly two-star, uninspiring dish, but at least it was edible and more or less what I was expecting at a place like this. Then, I opened the main package, and...dear lord! I ordered chicken, but I don't know which planet is rearing oyster-textured, gray-blue-fleshed chicken. The \"chicken\" was laid playfully in a bed of oversized chunks of celery, probably the least vegetable-y of all vegetables. The fried \"rice\" (again, I assume this was some extraterrestrial cereal lazily trying to pass as rice) was bright yellow with irregularly-shaped grains. I took one small bite of the chicken and, after managing to avoid throwing up, re-sealed the box, carried it down the street one block, and threw it into the trash. I had considered passing it along to a local homeless person, but no human being would deserve this. Needless to say, I will not be a repeat customer.

I loved it -- if mainly because I got twice the meat because there were no bones!The meat was dry, though. But, I actually expected that to happen for this dish. The fat was not as prevalent; the reason I like the fat is that it balances out the dryness of the meat. Perhaps they will honor my request for \"more fat\".The egg roll was okay. They give a lot of duck sauce and soy-less soy sauce.I have since tried their sweet and sour pork. I hate to say that it was not very good.

Okay. Well... I think we all know that I'm lying but I just had to attempt to find an excuse on why my adoring review of pop-up restaurant Buttermilk Road is just now being posted. What is Buttermilk Road, you ask? This is what proprietor and chef extraordinaire Lisa Donovan has to say:\"Buttermilk Road Sunday Supper is a pop-up restaurant based in Nashville, Tennessee that is meant to celebrate the tradition of the community-family Sunday feasts.\"I digress a bit and note that while it is certainly all that she describes, it is also just so much more than that too...Last November, I was lucky enough to secure a spot for the \"back to nature\" vegetarian supper that was hosted at East Nashville darling Barista Parlor. For a suggested $80 donation, I enjoyed 4 courses of innovative yet thoughtfully prepared cuisine, carefully curated cocktails and beverages, and satisfying appetizers while enjoying breaking bread (a Pain Brie Normandie at that!) with a small community of culinary aficionados. The casual elegance of Barista Parlor was the perfect platform for Lisa and her team to build a beautiful evening filled with the fragrant scent of scrumptious sustenance and undeniable charm. Many milled around the space and mingled while sipping on the Hot Apple Cider that was concocted of Lairds Apple Jack Brandy and Prichard's Tennessee Whiskey. Although, I knew that I should pace myself due to the bountiful courses ahead of me, I couldn't resist nibbling on the appetizers that were laid out. The Crostini with Eggplant Caponata and Fried Cippolini Onions was dangerously tasty while the Wild Mushroom Pate with Cumin Marinated Olives and Pain de Campagne still resonates with my taste buds. I'm a vegan so I passed on the Cheese Selection but I did thoroughly enjoy the Fresh Figs and Quince.And, to think... those were just the appetizers. I had contacted Lisa ahead of time to thank her for organizing a vegetarian themed supper as I was literally salivating at the opportunity to attend one of her events. Some of my friends were just raving on and on about how incredible their experiences were at a supper hosted at Burger Up while others were literally gloating about The Catbird Seat edition that was just a couple of weeks before. Lisa graciously replied that she would be happy to \"vegan-ize\" the menu for me and was as delightfully adorable as those revered little biscuits that she's known for.Throughout the evening, I couldn't help but smile as familiar faces were both sitting at the long rustic tables and also scooting out of the kitchen to giddily serve fine fare to the diners. I can't honestly think of another occasion where I was itching to join a kitchen or event crew in preparing and serving others. Perhaps, it was the intoxicating mulled wine but I'm certain the real reason is that these passionate folks are \"sharing\" a truly beautiful experience and not just \"serving\" supper. The first course consisted of Warm Asparagus Salad with Arugula, Walnut Vinaigrette and Poached Farm Fresh Egg but again, Lisa and Co. were able to alter this dish for me and I was more than satisfied with the tweak. The lust-worthy Buckwheat Crepe comprised of Housemade Ricotta, Roasted Fennel, Leeks, Romesco Sauce, and Fried Green Spanish Olives was a flavorful second course. The combination of the sauce and Spanish Olives burst with flavor. For the third course, one of my favorite beans was featured front and center with Artichoke, Pepper, and Chickpea Tagine served with Preserved Lemon, Chermoula, and Housemade Harissa. Seriously, it just doesn't get much better than that folks. We all know what is next... the final course. Hello, dessert! Along with cupping local favorite, Drew's Brew Coffee Service, we savored a Maple Cream Panna Cotta with Caramelized Pears and Oatmeal Crumble. My, oh, my. Lisa's extensive experience as a renowned pastry chef (with pedigreed stints at Margot, City House, and now Husk) really shine here. Her desserts aren't an afterthought of saccharine or fluff but instead has brought baking and \"sweets\" to a whole 'notha level.The evening ended nearly as magical as it started with many lingering around for a bit to bond and chatter about the wonderful circumstances that brought us all together to share such an intimate supper together. With Lisa's new role at Husk and the rising popularity of Buttermilk Road in other markets that have beckoned this pop-up to hit the road (a Southern Baking Class was hosted recently hosted in NYC), my only concern is that BR will start to resemble the well-intended family who initially dined together while sharing funny stories and playing games... However, as work deadlines loom and the kids grow up, these frequent meals become exclusive only to holidays or special occasions. I hope that the Buttermilk Road is a tradition that will live on at the dinner table and beyond.TIP: BR can also be commissioned to cater and plan private events too!", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 798 reviews", "date": "2013-08-17"}], "num_reviews": 1, "address": "\n            Pop-Up RestaurantNashville, TN\n        "}, {"rating": 4.0, "name": "El Tapatio", "phone": "6158354419", "url": "/biz/el-tapatio-nashville-2", "reviews": [{"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nGina D.\n", "review": "Best torta I've EVER had.

First she changed the item from what it's supposed to be, stated that it was pleasing to her, then added more good opinions and descriptions, but finally gave a 3 star review? o_0Both El Tapatio locations offer very similar quality. I first visited both locations 3 years ago and had disappointing experiences. I recently tried both locations again and the quality of the food has skyrocketed (both places). The quality of food is very similar to my favorite Mexican food in Nashville (Taqueria Express food trucks). El Tapatio is essentially a food truck that parks next to a vacant small building that they lease. The small building acts like a dining area, while the food truck acts like the kitchen.I ordered a variety of items to sample their asada (beef), pastor (spicy pork), and pollo (chicken). The asada is juicy and relatively flavorful, similar to the asada at Taqueria Express. The pastor is spicy, flavorful, and juicy. The quality of the pastor is high, similarly to Taqueria Express, but the flavor is very different than Taqueria Express (not good, not bad, just different). It's still very delicious.The chicken here is not as flavorful as the chicken found at Taqueria Express. However what it lacks in juiciness and flavor, it gains in the grilled flavor. I'm not entirely sure if they cook the chicken on an open flame, but it sure tastes like they do. And this is the one department where the chicken is better here than at Taqueria Express. I would not hesitate coming back here. The quality is on the same level as the Taqueria Express food trucks (best in Nashville). Then again, El Tapatio, this location at least, is essentially a food truck with an indoor dining area. Prices here are slightly higher than a regular food truck because they rent/lease space for a dining area.

Good tasting food to make you feel bad later. I've been coming to Cancun off and on for probably ten years. It's been consistent. I was a vegetarian when I started coming there and had no problems. Sometimes places sneak meat or by products into food that can make vegetarians sick, but not at Cancun!! The vegetarian options have always been yummy, filling, and (most importantly) cheesy. Even now that I'm eating meeting I still order the veggie options here. These days I only order take out, so I can't speak of the serving staff. They always answer the phone and get the order correct, unlike other places... There was one time that the order was incomplete and didn't include one item but they made it quickly. When ordering take out they always just say it'll be ten minutes and it's usually longer, so be forewarned.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 75 reviews", "date": "2014-09-12"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nNickie G.\n", "review": "Normally I would give Cancun a 3 star and maybe even a 2 star as I have definitely had better but there was one thing that was a superstar so I will go up since I know I will be back for it.This is your basic Mexican place for Nashville. Chips come out immediately. Salsa is just OK and has no heat whatsoever. Ask for some hot sauce. The menu is extensive and includes chicken, beef, and pescado dishes and even combination options. I got the chicken enchiladas. It was kind of odd to me that really it was cheese enchiladas with the chicken on TOP of them and then smothered in the red sauce. I am used to just putting the chicken and cheese inside the enchilada and doing it that way so it was odd. I put some hot sauce on it and made it much better.But the SUPERSTAR of the lunch, truly, was the chorizo cheese dip. So this is like your queso but with real honest to God chorizo in it. It was SPICY. It was GREASY (in a good way). The chorizo made me warm and happy. It was like for a small second I was back in TEXAS. Oh man, it was good. So I proceeded to top my enchiladas with this and then was a happy camper. Service was good, we were there at an off time so not a lot of competition. They have a big roomy bar there so I could see people sitting there getting their drink on after work during happy hour. Extra bonus that I was eavesdropping on the wait staff talking to each other and, thanks to my Duolingo Spanish app, I could pick up on some of what they were talking about.So when you go, just get your tacos or enchiladas or burritos or whatever you are getting, then get an order of this chorizo cheese dip, slather it on your food, and go to town! Add some hot sauce for extra spice and you can almost imagine what Tex-Mex (not Mex-Mex) would offer you.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 1027 reviews", "date": "2015-01-21"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nJordan F.\n", "review": "Well, once you've had real Mexican food it's hard to top.

Having just moved from Los Angeles where there is no shortage of delicious Mexican food, the burrito I had was insanely impressive. The food here is yummy! 5 stars there.The server wasn't really friendly at all though, and my experience so far in Nashville is that people are so nice. I get that sometimes we all have off days, but a smile and greetings would go a long way. I mean, he practically slammed our water on the table at one point and walked off. It was pretty awkward. So it's not a huge deal, but makes this more \"meh\" and not really as nice as it could be with some manners. There were really cheesy decorations too. Like paper decoration by the bar. That was confusing and killed any ambience. Also, I got a strawberry daiquiri that was literally disgusting. It tasted like heaps of gross artificial syrup. It would be so much better with actually strawberries and sugar. Seriously, un drinkable gross and a waste of money. The drink menu needs serious work. My husband's Sangria had no fruit in it. Hm? How boring. It was just... Wine. Anyway.Three stars for the burrito. It was pretty much amazing. Maybe one of the best burritos I've had cause without it this place would have two stars tops. Lol.

No way... or are all of those gitchy country knick-knacks blurring the tastes of their diners?Problem: food items like grits and gravy that sit too long before being served will develop a thick layer of film over the top of them when they aren't stirred. Liquid gluten turning into a solid. This is a natural occurring problem you can experience at home just as easily. So when the order comes to the table and there's a bowl of each and you have to poke through it with a fork to get to the source then you know its been sitting *in that bowl* for some time. In other words, these bowls were pre-filled then sat until our order came along. Kind of gross. I'd guess these had been bowled up as many as 10-15 minutes ahead of time which is unacceptable. No one in the back was on watch. Hello, supervisor?The country ham had an unusual amount of barnyard to the taste. Not sure what was going on there. I buy plenty of cured ham both from stores like Kroger and small local custom butchers (blue collar and prissy pants, there ya go). Something a little strange was going on with our cuts (we had the same meal). The eggs and cheesy hash browns, those were darn fine, and the coffee was sort of the truck-stop grade I'd expect. No complaints, just not my thing. The biscuits were hard on the bottom, difficult to cut with a fork. Guess from a lot of years of cooking: sitting since very early a.m. in a warmer and got cooked twice. Nothing difficult to figure out there.So, I finally experienced the Cracker Barrel.

As far back as I can remember I have never been a Cracker Barrel fan. When it is suggested I always shoot the suggestion down immediately basically because of the amounts of pepper they put in their food and the service telling me to pretty much \"suck it up buttercup that's how we cook in the south\" (this has been at numerous florida and georgia locations). Tonight we had planned on going to waffle house, and on a whim changed our minds due to the simple fact that my husband always caters to my wishes and I decided to take one for the team. My two kids whined when they heard we were not going to waffle house but we were able to calm their nerves letting them know they could get pancakes. We walked in and immediately my 3 year old has to pee so we take a family bathroom break before even being seated. The restrooms were extremely clean, no exaggeration here. I wouldn't classify myself as a full blown germ-a-phobe however I am the woman who makes my dancing toddler hold her bladder even longer while I squirt my hand sanitizer onto the toilet seat and wipe it down before she sits. I did NOT feel the need to do that in this restaurant because everything looked like it had just been cleaned and disinfected. No water puddles on the sink counter, and to top it all off the locks on the stalls had rubber coatings on them to prevent squeaking and scraping noises. Now that might not be so important, but it impressed the heck out of me and made me smile. OK OK, on to the good stuff. The hostess proceeded to seat us and when I asked to be seated against the wall he happily guided us to the wall. Again may not sound important, but I have an anxiety disorder that puts me in fits if seated in the center of a room and have been told at other restaurants that I could not be seated anywhere but the center, or given extreme attitude when requesting a different table as if it physically pained the person seating me. This was not the case here, he barely even blinked about it and was happy to seat me somewhere else. So we sit down and our waitress comes over within about 3 minutes, she takes our drink orders and explains to me that they are under staffed and running a little behind. She PRE-APOLOGIZES for any wait we may have. We could clearly see they were very busy compared to the amount of servers on hand. However she was back with our drinks in just a few minutes and took the time to explain some menu questions I had and did not behave in a rushed manner when doing so. We ordered our food and I had a lot of specific requests, due to my disdain for black pepper and my odd pregnancy cravings. She was very friendly about everything and repeated my order when I was done to make sure she got it all right, then she went above and beyond and told the cook in person about my pepper issue to be certain it was cooked to my liking. The wait was better than average especially for being busy and under staffed, we waited about 15 \u00a0minute and that is pushing it to a rough estimate. While we waited she brought my kids crayons which the hostess forgot, and even brought an extra pack which they were happy about. The eating area of the restaurant was just as clean as the bathrooms were. I mean, I really do not think I have ever seen such sparkling tables and floors in an eating establishment. Out came the food and this is usually when I regret coming to a cracker barrel... to my surprise everything was cooked to perfection with all of my ridiculous requests and not a hint of black pepper on anything but the gravy (which is pre cooked and she did explain that to me before hand, and I was ok with that) I ordered the country boy breakfast with a sirloin steak. My steak was moist and cooked precisely to my liking, as well as being flavorful and a generous portion of meat. Every single item was delicious. our server was Judy c. she was very sweet and honestly one of the best servers we have had in a long time, almost seemed maternal in her care for our family.AND FYI SHE HAD NO IDEA I WAS PREGNANT, so she was being genuine and not just worried about a hormonal breakdown. She kept apologizing for our wait in between table visits but she was so attentive you would have never known they were busy. So my point is I have been converted, I am officially a lover of Cracker Barrel like the rest of the southern people. If you are hungry just go to this Cracker Barrel, the menu options are vast and the service is phenomenal! We will definitely become regulars since we live right down the road.

A quick search on the Yelp app revealed Jet's (as would have just looking up and using my eyes). Reviews were solid. I thought I'd give it a try. The young lady behind the counter was nice and very informative. I let her know this was my first time at Jet's and she broke down the various styles and choices for me. After some quick debate, my large, thin veggie was being worked on. The cost for this bad boy? $17. Not bad at all.I didn't have to wait too terribly long before my pie was ready. By the time I arrived home, I was ready to chow down. I opened the box and... yep, this was Midwest/Great Lakes thin crust pizza, alright. This is a good thing. As I tore in to my squares I thought to myself that I should have checked Jet's out a while ago. This was solid, tasty, well-constructed pizza. It's not artisan blah blah blah nor is it trying to be.

As I've said before, I'm really pretty picky when it comes to pizza - it's hard to make it so bad that it's inedible, but it's also really hard to do it justice. I would say that Jet's is one of the top three pizza joints in Nashville, because when you get down to it, their pizza is supremely tasty and satisfying.I've had all three crust options now (thin, hand-tossed, and deep-dish) and all are really yummy and vastly superior to your other chain pizza places. It's also nice that they have seasoning options for the crusts, so even those doughy bits are delicious and delightful. I think I huge sticking point for me when it comes to pizza is the sauce - I don't like too much of it, and I don't like it when it is too thick and too much like tomato paste. Jet's sauce is light and fresh-tasting and also kind of sweet; it gets no complaints from me. We always seem to get an order of Jet's bread as well, which is really just cheesy garlic bread and is totally superfluous. I mean, do I really need a side of bread with my slice of bread? Probably not, but it's so yummy, we can never resist. Just be warned that if you ask for a side of ranch with your bread, be sure to check when you pick it up because they ALWAYS screw up and give marinara instead!Prices are good here, and there are always tons of coupons and deals that you can get off their website.

I'm easy-going, love hibachi grills. As an out-of-towner, my boyfriend wanted me to check out his favorite restaurant here, which made it very hard for me to write this review because it's not a good review, but because it's his favorite and he has great memories here and I'm not taking that away from his experience. This is my own and it's directed more towards the establishment itself. Our drinks were AWESOME so props to the bartender who was super cool. The aesthetic is really nice and stays true to Japanese style. I really liked how it was decorated. It was clean, great atmosphere and the wait staff was really friendly and good. So why 2 stars? Well, because it seems unfair as a customer and good paying customer too, my combo of filet, scallops, shrimp and chicken was dominated by more vegetables than anything! I kid you not, 3 shrimps and 4 small scallops I counted and the filet was good and so was the chicken. It was a better portion. But quite STINGY on the seafood portion. I don't know about you all. I eat at a lot of different types of restaurants from the highest Michelin starred celebrated chef restaurants to other regular standard restaurants to hole in the walls, just ALL types with all calibur, and I was appalled at the portions at this restaurant. The only reason why this combo costed $30+ is due to the seafood but it lacked its main star on the plate. I could have ordered just the filet for a bit cheaper but I just had expectations that they would be more generous even on a combo like other hibachi restaurants I've been to. So, it's the principle of price and quantity. Is it worth the price for this food?? Not really. Prices also take into consideration on how much the leasing cost on the entire building and location that this restaurant is connected to and location is what you're paying for too. I also found the food to lack flavor and gusto. It was quite bland and mediocre. So complaining to the manager wouldn't have solved anything because he can't make my food taste better. \u00a0I didn't want more seafood, I didn't want more of anything. I just couldn't believe people rated this place so high and were ok with being cheated on portions and not see you're paying for more than what you actually get.

(2/22/2015). \u00a0We did valet and had no issue leaving our car with the valet. \u00a0We later did have to wait for over 30 minutes to get our car from the valet; which was very frustrating. \u00a0When we entered there was an awful smell. \u00a0The facilities were very worn down. \u00a0Despite the fact that we had reservations, we had to wait over 30 minutes to be seated. \u00a0The lounge area was dark, but even with the lack of light it was apparent that the area suffered from neglect. \u00a0I am not a germ-a-phobe, but I was very uncomfortable sitting on the couches given the smell, texture and nasty film that seemed to cover everything. \u00a0I would have left immediately under any other circumstance, but this was my young daughter's \"dream\" place to eat so I bit my tongue and smiled. \u00a0When we were escorted to our table, we passed a large dryer fan perched on a table. \u00a0The kind of fans you see used for water damage. \u00a0This may have had something to do with the awful smell. \u00a0I was stunned by the condition of the restaurant that claimed to be a high-end Japanese Steak House.The table we were seated at was no exception to the poor condition I have described up until now. \u00a0The metal cooktop was not very clean and still had remnants of food from who knows when. \u00a0The metal was very warped and seemed long past its prime. \u00a0The large exhaust fans above the grills were very dirty and greasy looking too. \u00a0It looked like they have been repainted many times with thick and uneven coats of paint. \u00a0The light fixtures, walls, everything screamed to me that this place was falling apart.The service was adequate for a large casual dining chain restaurant, but certainly not up to par for a \"nice\" restaurant.The menu was in line with every other restaurant of this type I have visited. \u00a0I had the filet, scallops, shrimp, and chicken meal (decided to diversify my plate to increase the odds of getting something \"good\").The soup was a salty broth with a slice of mushroom and some pasta (bizarre). \u00a0The salad had bagged iceberg lettuce with some tomato slices and croutons. \u00a0But they must have remembered somewhere along the way that they were supposed to be \"Japanese\" so they put a ginger dressing on the salad. \u00a0As you may have inferred, the salad was lack-luster.The \"chef\" then came out to prepare our meal and entertain. \u00a0He smiled and said \"thank you\" a lot, but other than tapping the salt and pepper shakers against his spatula, there was no show. \u00a0In all fairness, he did also attempt the onion volcano, but it didn't really work out. \u00a0For those that have seen these \"shows\" before you'll appreciate that once he lit the volcano, he continued cooking the other items that were underway. \u00a0A minute or two later, he seemingly remembered that he didn't do the \"choo-choo train\" with the volcano (which never really lit on fire nor did it say stacked) and then tried to work the train back into the dinner. \u00a0However, I don't know that anybody understood at all that that was what he was trying to do. \u00a0I did have to laugh because it was such a ridiculous scene.As others have said, the food was bland, overcooked, and not of the highest quality. \u00a0Even the sauces were lackluster. \u00a0I will say that the orange sherbet was spot on. \u00a0It was a delightful ending to an otherwise disappointing experience. \u00a0It have obviously been pre-scooped, somewhat melted and then re-frozen in its dish; but it was the highlight of the night for me.Even with the Restaurant.com \"discount\", this was a very poor value. \u00a0This may be the first 1-star review I have given. \u00a0I highly recommend that you find another Japanese steakhouse if that's what you're looking for.", "location": "\nFranklin, TN\n", "exp": " 7 reviews", "date": "2015-06-29"}, {"rating": "1.0", "name": "\nLauren A.\n", "review": "I feel so bad for people who think this is five stars!

I suggest ordering the smallest size because you're going to have a lot of sides that come with the steak. You're going to have to pay extra for the fried rice but it's worth it since you get enough to feed 2 people. I also really liked the stir fried vegetables, mushrooms, shrimp and bean sprouts that came with my meal but everything is one note. There is no extra or special seasoning at all. At places like this, one thing that MUST be cooked right is the meat. Thankfully, my filet mignon was cooked to perfection. It was super tender and juicy and delicious with all the sides.

Most of all I guess the key is to just go with it. \u00a0Flaming onion volcanoes are still cool, food prepared in front of you is a very fun thing to see, and catching shrimp in a chef's hat is harder than it looks.Relax, eat some steak, and pretend you are not a jaded adult for a while, worked for me.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 214 reviews", "date": "2011-01-05"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nRichard L.\n", "review": "They have changed the soup and salad since we came last and they were great.

The whole staff was hanging out together (kitchen+bar+servers) and seemed way more interested in the 5 year old than taking care of customers. When we walked in (with only one other table in the whole bar there at 8:30 on a Friday night) literally all 4 staff just stared at us - no one said Hi or offered us a table or said welcome. Management needs to work on that. How rude! We had to ask, after standing in a practically empty restaurant staring at 4 staff for about 30 seconds, if we should just grab ourselves a table.

The cole slaw is not mayo based, but more tart - vinegar tasting, which is great to me...and no fat :) Even better. I will be back to try the turkey and for sure will be back for the pulled pork.

When he called me back, he told me that he just shows that the total was run for $43, but they have no supporting documentation for what the actual bill was. It was just charged as $43 by the server, but there is no way of telling what I really spent, other than what the server entered.

Each visit was ho him but had potential greatness. The food sounded great but always failed to wholly deliver. My last visit was the straw that broke the camels back and I have to leave a negative review. First, they sell baked goods but they are not fresh. If you go in one day and look at the pastries, the exact same ones will be there the next day. They are not fresh. What bakery has the stones to sell day old anything. I went in this morning and ordered 2 lox bagels with cream cheese and capers. I told the cashier to please go heavy on the capers. He said no problem. I ordered cheese grits as well. He then had to check if they had lox. He checked and said they were prepping it now. I sat and waited 15 minutes for them to prep two portions of lox, 2 raw bagels and cream cheese. They ran out of capers so I suggested they open a jar of the capers they had on sale. They did. They portioned out grits and I left, 20 dollars lighter. I got home and opened up the bagels. They looked wrong. They claimed to use Bagelface bagels but these were not Bagelface bagels. Please refer to the pictures I have uploaded. Compare them to the Bagelface bagels on their Yelp page. These were icy cold and doughy. 99% sure they are Lender's Bagels. The lox was revolting. Very little flavor beyond the distinctive taste of rotten fish. Grits were dry and tasteless. I called to voice a complaint and got a manager to call me back. I told him his bagels did not come from bagelface and his lox tasted like spoiled fish or catfood. He insisted the bagels were from Bagelface but offered a refund on the bagels. Then I said the grits were nasty so he offered a refund of the whole thing. Normally this would be enough to assuage me to not write anything, but I'm really not happy about being served lousy lox and a supermarket bagel for 6.50 and being asked to wait 15 minutes for it. Hell, they were probably sending a busboy out to get some lox and bagels from the Kroger next door. Saturday breakfast ruined. Thanks Table 3!Update: just called bagelface and they said NO, they do not deliver to Table 3 market. So the manager of this Market definitely lied to my face when he said the bagels were from Bagelface! Wow! I am really incensed!

Originally we had gone down the shopping center to Corner Pub but their hours are wrong on their website so we came here. I've been to this Brewhouse several times mostly to watch football. The last time I was there was the last straw after several weeks of receiving bad and rude service, but we put up with it because they were close and had the Sunday Ticket. The menu had been changed and updated which was nice to see. My eye immediately went to the Cajun burrito as I love all things burritos and tortillas and can never say no to a no traditional burrito. According to the menu it was shrimp and chicken jambalaya inside of a flour tortilla with andouille sausage and Tasso ham smothered with a spicy Cajun sauce. Sold. The burrito wasn't bad, it just wasn't good. The jambalaya and meats were dried. I wasn't expecting fresh but I wasn't expecting something that previously tasted frozen and devoid of moisture. There wasn't really any spice or heat. When I order something that promises to be Cajun at the very least I expect spice, even if the heat isn't there. We also started with the chips and queso and \"Diablo\" red salsa. Neither were good but we are them anyway. My dining companion had the pulled pork sandwich, served alone on a big plate. It had jalape\u00f1o bacon that didn't impress him one bit. He also had the chicken tender basket with steak fries. I stole a few fries and a tender.

Among the comedy of errors was a dirty table that remained uncleared for at least 30 minutes next to us, 4 different dirty wine glasses that were cycled through one table, one of our orders being wrong, no water refills during the entire time we there, and extremely slow service in general.The food used to be so good but it's become a standard corporate menu that is no better than the olive Garden and I hate to say it but I've had better pastas from the freezer section at Target.

I discovered this place because next door Prince's was way too busy with a line out the door, and I was looking for immediate gratification without waiting in the then-cold outdoors. China Village definitely fit the bill. Plus, combination platters are super cheap and come with a great deal of food, perfect for leftover lunches. The spice factor is perfect for the spicier dishes such as orange chicken or General Tso's.Again, due to the ambience, I advocate takeout or delivery. Though China Village has a small dining area, it is a in the middle of a heavily trafficked area (lots of people getting to-go and delivery), and the kitchen is in full-view. You would much rather prefer to eat at home.They really take care of their regulars, as shown by the series of thank you letters displayed on the wall from over a decade of service. It takes at least some quality Chinese food, especially in Nashville, to have such long-lived loyalty in over ten years of service by this family restaurant.So, if you live in East Nashville or nearby, and are craving some good takeout, China Village is a great place!", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 61 reviews", "date": "2015-09-14"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nJoanna L.\n", "review": "Not the best Chinese food I've had but it'll get the job done.

Housed in a dingy strip mall next to Princes Hot Chicken, China Village has none of its neighbor's appeal. The folks here are working hard, keeping the place clean, while turning out fried American Chinese food that is a step below Manchu wok. I hope this family sees the light, and opens up in better location, charges more, and uses higher quality food. In East Nashville, the owner's hard working attitude could finally fill the East Nashville Chinese food desert. The fried rice is dry and precooked, only to be reheated with your favorite meat. The Kung Pao Chicken had a brown sauce and was filled with low quality vegetables like celery to save cost. If you want to stuff your face with cheap Chinese-American food this place could fit the bill, but if you want real Chinese food, don't even think about it.

We ordered food to go and just assumed that like most Chinese places, the food would be ready to go in about 10 mins. We left immediately as we live 10 mins away. \u00a0Husband went inside and waited for probably 15 minutes. He said they only had one cook and were obviously pretty busy. No big deal, the food should be nice and hot. However, he said the interior was freezing and smelled like a bathroom. That immediately turned me off from this place and I didn't even go inside. We got our food and drove home. We both ordered General tso tofu, mine with steamed rice, his with fried rice, we shared a small order of plain lo mein, and crab rangoon. The tofu was good and hot. My rice was fine. I thought his tasted old and kind of like smoke? The lo mein was tasty. The crab rangoon were cold so we heated them in the oven. Weird that they would be cold. It's as if they cooked them then let them sit while they cooked 10 other people's food, then made our entrees. Anyway this wasn't my favorite place, and it was definitely sketchy as all get out, but we will probably order again down the road I'm sure.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 237 reviews", "date": "2015-02-23"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nMegan T.\n", "review": "I went because there were good reviews.
