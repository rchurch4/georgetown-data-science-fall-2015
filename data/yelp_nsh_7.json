They automatically bring out warm rolls and a white bean with olive oil and rosemary dip that that is a very nice combination of flavors.

We were told all the pasta sauce is made to order. When we got the food, the pastas looked great and tasted okay. Nothing memorable. I got the sausage, sage, & apple ravioli with pomodoro sauce (tomato sauce). The sauce is pretty good. A little sweet, which I like. The ravioli pasta was good but the filling could have had more flavor and been more fresh. My wife had spinach pasta with a white wine sauce. The sauce again was tasty but the pasta didn't have any distinct flavors. The fresh mozzarella was cheese but not fresh. The free bean dip was very good and tasty. The Italian nachos were surprisingly good but seemed to be fried pasta with Alfredo sauce. Overall it was good, not great. \u00a0We may return if we want just pasta.

We were a party of 24 that turned to 14 and the manager was not very happy about that. As we all sat down the server was not happy that another server was assigned to help him with our party. As an ex restaurant manager myself I would've taken that to the back. But as we ordered drinks and appetizers, it did get a little better. We had the bruschetta which was really good and fresh. \u00a0It was well seasoned and the fresh basil and tomato we're great. We also had the artichoke dip which was good too but not served super hot. \u00a0As you know the premise of this restaurant is fresh pasta and I could see the headache building for the chef as the restaurant was more than half full and I could envision the pots of boiling pasta water filled to the brim. \u00a0As our entr\u00e9es arrived I was able to try a spoonful of the Bolognese which was very good. As I was looking over the menu though I decided for the pappardelle pasta and Granchio sauce. \u00a0This is the definition of Granchio directly from their website. \u00a0Granchio lump crab meat, white wine, diced tomato, garlic, olive oil and hot pepper. \u00a0Homemade pasta is very thirsty and I could tell mine had dried up by how the pasta stuck together and the sauce was not evident, so I asked for some extra olive oil. After I had added the olive oil and tossed my pasta, I went for another bite. \u00a0The crabmeat was not lump as honestly for the price I was not expecting that, but I was expecting a little more than what appeared to be backfin. There was no seasoning and I could hardly tell that there was white wine and garlic in the sauce. Overall I think this dish was not put together very well. \u00a0The rest of the table seemed to like what they had, so I will probably go back to try another dish. \u00a0Over all our experience was good but I must say the hospitality was not there in the beginning and that's the first chance to WOW someone. \u00a0On a lighter note the restaurant was very clean and they were willing to take a reservation for a party as large as ours on Mother's Day.", "location": "\nLakewood, TN\n", "exp": " 17 reviews", "date": "2015-06-28"}, {"rating": "1.0", "name": "\nHeather H.\n", "review": "Sat for 15 mins just for a waitress, very apologetic and said she would be extra attentive to us but that didn't happen either.

That was, until I ate there. I've given this location lots of tries. Lots. And it always falls flat. My last experience is a pretty good snap shot of how it goes. We sit and wait for a server. And wait. Oh, and then wait. Once he or she arrives, we order drinks -- because we like wine. But any appetizers (and or the free dip they serve) arrives much ahead of the wine. So far ahead that we only order one drink, when we'd like two ... or three (don't judge, we walk there). Then, there's the dip. It's a white bean dip with rosemary and olive oil. The drip, usually the consistency of hummus arrives drowning in oil. Yuck. I order GF pasta with broccoli added and the broccoli isn't cooked.

Once we were seated our table was patio furniture with our door chairs that were strun throughout the restaurant . BUT it gets worse next we sat for 10 minutes without service until my husband got up and asked the hostess what was going on... And could we get our server. Only to get our drinks brought to us in styrofoam cups and bean dip in a styrofoam bowl. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? We reserved this 4 days in advance .. It's not like you didn't know we would be arriving ! We never got our appetizer of spinach dip.. I think because our server was clearly overwhelmed with all the disarray of people and patio furniture ..We were at your restaurant over 2 hour just to get our dinner!! UNACCEPTABLE ....We asked our server to speak with the manger ,that never happened either... In my 40 years of living this by far was the worst dinning experience ever!!! We live in Donaldson and we believe in spending our money with the locals as much as possible . BUT Mirkos we will never be back!!! We are very establish bussiness wise here in Donalson and the word Mirko will never be one of our recommendations to anyone!! I understand that restaurants get busy and things happen.

I wouldn't have wanted to be in his shoes, dealing with under staffing that day. Luckily lack of staff didn't affect the food, nor did it affect the service as we once again were met with a knowledgeable and friendly server.

Our server was bubbly and rattled off the 20 or so different pasta varieties, took our order, then disappeared. \u00a0When she brought our sparkling wine, which came in individual serving plastic bottles, she brought one that was already opened, flat, and half empty, asked what one of our table had ordered again, and disappeared. \u00a0When she showed back up she told us that the bottle must have been opened to mix one of their wine blends and she'd bring another - which they didn't end up having in stock. \u00a0About this time another server showed up with an appetizer that we didn't order before finding his way to the right table. \u00a0My drink glass stayed empty for 10 minutes during her absence. \u00a0Our food arrived and was excellent.

In all fairness, you really don't need those chips because two pupusas are more than enough to put anyone of moderate hunger down for the count.The pupusas here are slightly thicker, lighter, and fluffier than the ones of which I am accustom.

Moving from Miami to Nashville, I had to change my expectations when it comes to eating Latin cuisine. I was going to say good-bye to black beans, plantains and adobo and say hello to tortillas, papusas and tacos. It's all good. I eat it all. So, it came to pass that on a hot summer day, I needed a margarita. Luckily, my friend knew just where to bring me. The margarita program at Five Points is strong. Served either on the rocks or deliciously slushified, there are a variety of flavors from which to choose. Don't settle for a regular margarita when you can be like Johnny T and get a blackberry one! Holla! No sooner had my chalice of tequila berry magic come to me than was I presented with a basket of crisp, thin chips and a tub o' salsa. Now we have a party. Y'see as abundant as Miami is with Caribbean fare, when it comes to Mexican eats, it trails behind other cities. It tasted great to be eating real Mexican food again. Not content to much on chips & salsa (although I could have), I took advantage of the lunch specials (there are a lot of them and they're favorably priced) and ordered a chimichanga with guacamole. It came with beans, lettuce, pico de gallo, a metric ton of hot, bubbly melted cheese.I destroyed it... and it took some effort to do so. For a lunch portion, the chimichanga was pretty large.

The waitress took the sampler appetizer plater back while we ate our regular meal. She forgot the tortialls for my husband and jalepenos for myself. This is expected as its a brand new place, so not everything was going to come out perfect as there is a hefty menu to memorize. The fajatas were pretty standard but my husbands carne asada was over cooked, no seasoning (not even salt/pepper) and didn't get that crispy grilled crust- seemed more like it was cooked on a flat top. I will say the 2.99 maragritas were really good- better than other places in town for a house marg. The other highlight that was good was the appetizer platter, once it came back.

It's basically just a shack with a screened-in porch. I've eaten awesome barbecue from even more run-down spots than this, so I wasn't too worried.Their only option for beef was a pulled brisket plate, and I wasn't really in the mood for chicken or turkey. That narrowed things down to pork, which is probably the most appropriate order at a place called Hog Heaven anyway. I got their Spareribs Plate, with potato salad and white beans on the side, plus the automatic pancake-style cornbread. I made sure to ask for sauce on the side. The guy at the counter assured me that their white barbecue sauce was an excellent dipping sauce for ribs.All of the sides looked pretty good from the outset. The cornbread was ok, though a tad dry. Luckily for me, the potato salad was creamy and rather tasty. There was a good blend of spices and plenty of bite from all of the red onion mixed throughout. My beans had an interesting flavor, kind of like a bean soup without all the liquid. The slightly-mangled ribs appeared to have a good crust. All of the meat fell off in my fingers, which is usually a bad sign. I found a decent smoky flavor, but otherwise the ribs were kind of bland. Some parts of the meat were a little tough as well. Although I'm not a big sauce guy in general, I thought the white barbecue sauce might help jazz things up a little. The white sauce was much zestier than regular red barbecue sauce. It also added some heat, which played nicely. I know that white barbecue sauce is generally reserved for poultry, but I really enjoyed pairing it with the pork ribs.My favorite part of this meal was definitely the white barbecue sauce, but it wasn't enough to salvage the mediocre ribs.

It's pretty much an outdoor shack with a few picnic tables in front so my advice would be to not come here on a cold day.I read the reviews beforehand so I went with the pulled turkey plate with white sauce, mac and cheese, and baked beans. The pulled turkey had a really good smokey flavor and the white sauce was really freaking tasty. It did pack a little punch, though, and my nose was running by the time I was done. My spice tolerance is really low, so for everyone else it would probably be fine. It comes with a cornbread pancake which was just eh in my opinion. The mac and cheese was pretty good and since we came here about 30 minutes before closing, it was a little mushy but the flavor was good. The baked beans I did not care for at all. There was just a weird taste to them, so I wasn't really a fan. The other thing is that the prices are kinda high considering it was just average. I paid almost $14 for a meat with 2 sides and a drink. Just a touch on the high side considering what you're getting.Overall this place has some pretty decent BBQ. I haven't really had much since moving here, so I don't have much for comparison. However, the pulled turkey with that white sauce... that alone is enough to make me come back here again. I'd like to come back earlier in the day to see if the sides and cornbread were just a little off due to it being close to closing time.

I have to say that I know my barbeque pretty well, and that this place was - well - okay. It wasn't bad barbeque, but it wasn't great. The pork was moist and tender (a definite plus for any barbeque aficionado) but not really as smokey as what I would have hoped a place like Hog Heaven could come up with. The \"mild\" sauce was similarly decent, but not great: definitely strong on the tomato and spices, a little bit peppery and a little bit sweet. As a lover of Kansas City-style barbeque, I'm familiar with tomato sauces, and this was neither as sweet as it could have and should have been nor was it applied as liberally to the pulled pork as it could have been.The sides were a mixed bag. The baked beans were surprisingly good, with a lot of pepper, an interestingly creamy sauce, and excellent texture. The greens and cornbread hoecake were, to be totally honest, disappointing. The greens were flavorless and mushy and the corn cake was also generally underwhelming.I wouldn't advocate this place as the first choice for barbeque in Nashville, but if you're by Centennial Park and absolutely don't want to cross the city to get to Mary's on Jefferson, Hog Heaven will suffice.", "location": "\nIndianapolis, IN\n", "exp": " 4 reviews", "date": "2013-06-28"}, {"rating": "2.0", "name": "\nDren R.\n", "review": "This place was a huge let down Maybe my expectations were too high to begin with, but damn it, I am a foodie for goodness sake!

The guy suggested that the combination of their pulled chicken with their white white sauce would bring things to the next level of flavor-fulness. \u00a0The chicken was very moist and I must admit rather tasty with the sauce.If you really need a beer with your dinner, it looks like they will deliver to the dive bar next door.

This 8pc. roll is a simple blend of avocado and tuna, flavors complemented each other and the fish tasted fresh. The salmon maki roll is really tiny in size but at least it tasted good. As for the chirashi, it includes about 4 different fish served over sushi rice and topped with some sliced beets. Something that really made me laugh was the soup! One of our friends ordered the miso soup and it came out in the smallest bowl I have ever seen, in fact the spoon was too big for the bowl. The bowl is akin to a dessert bowl for a scoop of ice cream. It's incredibly teeny. I think a major takeaway point here is to be aware of the portion sizes! As others have mentioned, the prices here are really steep. My crazy tuna was $18, chirashi $25 for reference. Although the sushi tastes good I wouldn't say their prices are worth it. I've had sushi equally as good for less. But my overall experience was good and my party enjoyed ourselves.Would I come here again for a causal dining experience? Nah.

No, this isn't your mom & pop sushi spot. Yes, the prices are probably higher than you want to pay for a to-go order. But this isn't a to-go kind of spot. This is a destination spot for a fun evening of eating and drinking. Thing is, if you want a more affordable, casual experience, you can get it here. The lunch menu/special is cost effective and Nama offers a happy hour that introduces their food/drink program for reduced price.Look up, look down, look all around... this is why the prices are higher. The folks behind the Nama machine spent time, effort and money to construct a visual appealing place (that patio alone) at which people would want to spend some time. Yes, it's an interesting situation that there are other sushi restaurants within spitting distance but they offer very different experiences.* This is a fun, sexy place to which you could take your gf, boss or buddy and have a fantastic experience. I've spoken on the decor and vibe... let's get to the food.It's awesome. Nama offers a broad Japanese food experience. While the maki is good, allow yourself some time to venture past the sushi offerings. When it comes to rolls, the caterpillar (eel, snow crab, cucumber topped with avocado and eel sauce) and crazy tuna (spicy tuna, cucumber topped with seared albacore, avocado, scallion and ponzu sauce) are my jams. No mayo or cream cheese to be seen. But when I'm in the mood for a different sort of party, Nama is quick to oblige. For instance, the wasabi hummus is truth. Get ready for your next addiction. The miso soup does skew a bit to the salty side, but I like salt. I don't quite get how the crab & asiago dip fits in to the Japanese point of view but after the first taste, I decided to stop asking questions and to eat more. I could put a tub of that away. The salad offerings aren't as successful, in my experience. I've found the house salad to be watery and the seaweed salad to have an off-putting aftertaste. No worries. More dip & hummus for me. Then there's the hot food. Try this. Order this. Put this into your rotation. I don't know of other restaurants in town offering this slice of Japanese life and you're gonna want it. Both the katsudon and the currydon are fantastic blends of protein, vegetables, rice, and spice. One comes with egg. The other comes a little sweeter. They're both flavor bombs that may make you forget about sushi altogether.It's important to know what you're getting in to when you go to Nama. Here you're getting an elevated food experience without snobbery. Yes, the price point is higher than what you get at a mom & pop joint but this isn't a mom & pop joint. Nama may not be your all day every day sushi joint but once you check out the breadth and depth of the menu, it'll become part of your Friday night rotation. Definitely.*No shade.

WHO MAKES MOUSSE OUT OF SWEET POTATOES?? Especially Japanese sweet potatoes?? Geniuses. Thats who. Japanese sweet potatoes are, the funny enough... yellower and sweeter cousin of the standard/central American sweet potato. (Side note- if you really decide you like Japanese sweet potatoes you can buy it at the grocery store off Charlotte next to Lucky bamboo). Anyway, we ordered the mousse and were Blown away. It was incredibly creamy and rich with just the right amount of sweetness. I really thought there was avocado in it (theres not- I asked). And hey, its sweet potato- thats Paleo right. That means its like 100% healthy right?Best Sashimi deal in Nashville Hands down.2) The Nama people sell themselves short on the description of this salad on their menu. Its under Spicy Sashimi salad and $12 at lunch (apparently the dinner portion is even bigger but for a slight price increase). Coming in at a whooping ~15+ pieces of sashimi on top of mixed greens with other shredded veggies.. it was a steal.

When you first walk in it has a really trendy and upscale ambiance. The lights are dim, the tables are decorated really well, and people were dressed a little nicer than you would normally be. After we were seated I looked at the drink menu and was surprised at how much they offered. They had a really long wine and sake list that I was eager to try. Alright Virago, you're winning me over at this point.What really won me over was the jalapeno yellowtail for starters. Holy hell was that good. It was such a good cut of fish, it literally melted in your mouth. After that I threw all caution into the wind, unhinged my jaw like an anaconda, and ate everything they brought out to me. The only thing I wasn't wowed by was the crispy brussel sprouts. It was meh, tasted like some baked brussels with way to much soy sauce.

Setting: Since we had no reservation on a busy weeknight, there were no tables open so we opted for the sushi bar which does have a full menu. Pros: The decor of the restaurant was nice and I liked watching the sushi chefs crafting the sushi. The cocktail menu was cute and the drinks were quite delicious! The menu offers sushi options as well as hot food which was great. The miso cauliflower was pretty delicious as an appetizer. Cons: It was really difficult to get ahold of our server. We probably didn't get to order until 20-25 minutes after we sat down and took equally as long to get food. It's not that the food itself was bad, but it took so long to get served and the food was mostly just okay (we got sashimi and maki mono). Also, the prices are a little high compared to other M Street restaurants. Overall: For me, it was difficult to justify the prices despite the convenience to my apartment.

[Spoiler: Everything was slightly or a whole lot spicier than some may be accustomed.] The downside of the trendiness of this place was that it took forever for my party to find the door, as we were totally sober at that point in the night, so it wasn't the fault of a drunk bachelorette. I felt as if we were looking for the Room of Requirement. [Spoiler #2: Door was located in an alley between the Virago and Moto. It was not obvious.]Onto the point of a restaurant, let me focus on the food. As mentioned earlier, the menu options tended to be familiar Japanese-American fare, with a twist. Namely, that meant that everything was spicy hot. Wasabi Cream Cheese. Honey Fire Sauce. Sriracha. See what I'm saying? There's nothing wrong with a little extra spice in one's life, but it might not be for everyone. If you want a simple California or Philly Roll, don't come here, because you will be disappointed. If you want to try something a bit different, Virago is certainly the place to be. Overall, the food was incredibly good. Service was hit or miss.

Everyone at the table loved Virago and went on & on about it. Since I have never been (confession: I went once for cocktails ~4 years ago at the old location but ate nothing because I was a broke grad student) we decided it was high time we venture back to the Gulch to check out Nashville's swankiest place for sushi.Virago is a very cool place. So cool that they kinda hide the door from you. The entry to the restaurant is down a little alley and to the left, with only a tiny sign giving any indication you're in the right place. I'll be honest and say that we scoped out the wrong end of the building before doing a face-plam and walking down the alley to find the actual door. On the way we walked passed this beautiful outdoor patio which I can only imagine is blissful in the summertime.The decor of Virago has major sex appeal. Everything is dark with low lighting, warm tones and comfortable seats. Everyone looks sexy in low-light and I realized that this is a perfect date spot. Why in my many years of dating in Nashville did no dude ever take me here? WHY? Overall, it reminded me of some of the fancier hotels I have been in. This place is very hip and I thought I wouldn't be cool enough to get a table or get the staff to look at me. I was quite wrong about that. The clientele were just regular people out for a nice meal. There were regularly dressed people my age, some bedazzled ladies ready for a night on the town, and a table that looked like my parents. I guess I shouldn't stress about stuff like this- but I do.The cocktail list was very impressive and many of the drinks sounded good, making it a tough choice. I ordered the pear-lavender cocktail made with gin, lavender syrup and pear nectar. I really loved this drink and I might come back just to sip it at the bar. It had a gentle floral flavor that enhanced the notes in the gin. Steve ordered the ginger and lychee mojito and it was very sweet from the lychee flavor. But it was a subtle, light sweetness. It was good, but I liked mine better.For an appetizer we chose the ninja bacon, which is a crispy pork belly covered in squid ink after it's been cooked sous vide for 40 hours. It's served with red curry and coconut milk gels and dehydrated pineapple powder. YOWZA! That's a lot of flavors but it all worked really nicely together. The dehydrated pineapple was light and fluffy and added just a bit of sweet before it melted away in your mouth. I especially liked the mixture of the sweet coconut milk gel with the saltiness of the pork belly. We went all out on the sushi. The first roll was the Phantom (tempura calamari, poblano pepper, cucumber, and avocado wrapped in black rice with soy tobiko, balsamic soy, sriracha). This roll was really soft on the palate and it seemed to melt in your mouth. I was quite happy that the soy didn't overpower the roll, making it taste like salt and nothing else. Everything blended well together, and I love the sushi chef's attention to detail in the presentation.Next up was the honey fire (tempura shrimp, eel, Asian pear, jalape\u00f1o and honey fire sauce), which had a pleasing sweet and tangy heat that was very addicting. This sauce would make some killer chicken wings, just saying. I loved the crunch of the fresh roe on top but I wish the eel was just a tad bit warmer. I like my eel warm because it creates a nice opposition to the cold rice and veggies. Next up was the white dragon (shrimp, tuna, avocado, cucumber, pickled onions, cilantro and wasabi mayo, wrapped in hamachi and topped with sesame). The hamachi was very fresh and of very high quality. I loved the addition of the fresh scallion which added a fresh cooling flavor to balance out the heat of the sriracha.For dessert we got a sweet sushi roll: The Hawaii Five-O (soy wrap, hamachi, escolar, hearts of palm, avocado, cream cheese and mango inside, rolled in toasted coconut, wrapped in kiwi, topped with honey fire sauce and macadamia nuts). There was so much going on here, but again the complexity worked out nicely. This roll also used that amazing honey fire sauce, but mixed with the fresh fruit and cream cheese it became more sweet. The toasted coconut covered the rice and was amazingly delicious. The only sad thing here was that the taste of the fish itself got buried under all the other flavors. \u00a0I loved my dinner at Virago. Every dish was well prepared and beautifully presented. The cocktail list is outstanding and the service was topnotch.

I'll just mention two key factors that made this experience worth the $$ :1. Atmosphere. My husband and I are fairly new to Nashville and very new to big city life. We love experiencing different places. The atmosphere in Virago is superb. From the outside appearance, feeling like your escaping to a hidden gem, to the inside lighting, music, and ambiance.. We felt like we were VIP from the get go. It's a very \"chill\" scene, just our style. 2. Service. We had the best Waiter we've had in years. We recommend Nate with two thumbs up. He recommended things without us asking, walked us through the menu, and made us feel at home. We are not picky eaters so we tried everything he recommended, from starters to dessert and we cannot say enough about how much we enjoyed our food. Recommendations: Miso Cauliflower as a starter. My husband doesn't even like cauliflower and he could not stop eating it. We are sushi eaters (and they also have other Japanese style food you can choose from) so: my husband got The Bomb roll which is literally.. The Bomb. We have eaten many of a sushi, but this roll was by far our favorite thing ever, hands down. Nate also recommended The Equador which is also a popular roll and that's what I got. It was mouth watering and fresh tasting. But if you're truly looking for a sushi taste you'll love forever, do yourself a favor and order The Bomb. Oh, and for dessert do the Mochi.. Our waiter described it as ice cream with a shell of a gummy bear.. And that's exactly how it tasted except better.

The vibe wasn't nearly as swank as I expected, but then again: The male version of me, myself, and I are hard sells. Putting superficial conversation aside, we dug into the V2 Edamame and The Bomb Roll. Okay, what can I say about The Bomb that hasn't been said before? A lot . . . c'mon guys. First off, I'm from Texas and live in California currently: I would NEVER justify $19 for this roll. The roll is baked and consists of: tempura shrimp, avocado, asparagus on the inside, baked jumbo lump crab and spicy mayo on top with a touch of unagi sauce and scallions. Sounds savory, right? Except the over proliferation of white and almost crunchy rice overpowers what should be a very flavorful experience. It's always disappointing when rolls are rice heavy.

Does NOTHING make her happy? But you'd be wrong. I am thrilled to find a great restaurant or service provider. I love nothing better than to have an amazing experience and I would (and have!) happily paid hundreds of dollars for the privilege. It's when I pay hundreds of dollars (or even a few dollars) to have a terrible experience that I get upset.Speaking of...Virago is like a very pretty girl (or guy) who is all looks and no substance. Once you get inside you want a little something more, if you know what I mean. And so it was with this expensive waste of calories. Visually it was fantastic. Little Buddhas and Asian statues? Loved it. Lighting? Wall art. Staff uniforms. Fabulous. Food? Awful. Service? Sucked.Like truly awful. Like amazingly awful. Like the kind of awful you have to tell people about. So here goes...Yes, I recently moved here from Los Angeles - home of amazing sushi. I take that into account and I still come up with the verdict: awful. I'm not scared. I've eaten sushi from Publix here in Nashville and you know what? It was better. And so was the price tag. We paid almost $75 for 3 rolls and a glass of wine and one after the other they were all worse than the last. Even the wine--my faithful friend--tasted like dishwater. Strange. The fish was mushy and off-color, we're not in danger of food poisoning, but we were definitely shocked at the quality. And why does almost every roll include something tempura (fried) and cream cheese or mayo? I feel like the good people of Nashville are more than ready to break away from their eating stereotypes, is it strange that the Virago chef doesn't agree? And the service. Oh my. Nice enough server, but honey, learn to multi-task. A glass of wine should not take 20 minutes to arrive. Soy sauce in a sushi restaurant should be on the table, not have to be requested from 2 (TWO!) different servers and still take 10 minutes to make it to the table. And the check? When two people are sitting there with coats on holding their purses and craning around to find you...probably not a good idea to walk by and then attempt to walk by again without acknowledging your impatient diners. Just a tip that must not have come with the training.All I ask from sushi are at least two out of these three things:1. Be fresh.2. Taste good.3. Don't make me sick. Virago delivered on one. And, yes, I realize this is landlocked Nashville. Does that mean that good sushi can only ever be a fantasy? Ever been to Japonais in Chicago? Incredible! Food AND decor.

This review is from the perspective of someone who dined on the patio.On a week night its no problem to make a reservation in advance to get a seat on the patio. The patio is really was solidified my experience, and it was intimate and felt kind of club like (in a good way!). The seating includes lounge-esque booths, or tables with a better view and they played house music that was muted enough to just really be background noise and drown out your neighbors conversation. Pending good weather the patio really is too cool, it provides an awesome look at the downtown Nashville skyline. Virago setting: 5 out of 5 stars. The food standouts - The crispy brussels sprouts side order... random? Yes, but they were cooked perfect and just a little crunchy and enough salty. MMM! Also on the random but tasty train, I recommend the Shishito Peppers as well, again crispy and savory. My friend had the Stoned Steak Filet which is raw pieces of beef filet and a 1200 degree stone for you to cook the pieces of beef. She said the portions were just right, and it came with two sauces that she said were great! Who doesn't like some fun and interactive dining with a blazing hot rock?We ordered 3 sushi rolls and if you're new to sushi or not feeling adventurous 'The Godzilla' roll was a safe, sure bet. 'The Bomb' roll came in at $19 and was more of a bomb in my wallet. It comes with baked crab meat on top, and they really don't skimp on this which all sushi lovers can appreciate. The unagi sauce was too sweet though and took over the flavor of the roll. If you're going to call something 'the bomb', it better be really f***ing good. Avoid - Steer clear of the 'Rising Sun' roll. Everything in the roll was mushy, and something in it did not taste fresh, 2 day drive to the ocean anybody? The tempura crunch was lacking the crunch. It would have really benefitted from the texture and freshness of say, a cucumber. The Sweet Soy Edamame is a horrible thing to serve on the menu. Yea sure they tasted alright, but the sweet soy sauce was so incredibly sticky and thick, I needed a wet nap when I was done. Why would you serve finger-food edamame drenched in a sticky mess? Sauce on the side = problem solved. Being from California I have some pretty high expectations for fresh sushi. The sushi at Virago was pretty good, but not THE BOMB. Like I said, the patio was perfect, service was great, and luckily we were celebrating an occasion and could justify going to a spendier place. I'm sure you could get similar quality sushi for a better price elsewhere in Nashville, you're just paying for the scene at Virago. 5/5 for atmosphere, 3.5/5 for food.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 124 reviews", "date": "2013-08-14"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nRyan O.\n", "review": "Virago might be one of the most well decorated interiors in all of Nashville. The d\u00e9cor is incredibly posh and is just an all around awesome lounge. The attention to detail of everything inside all the way down to the lavatory is just exquisite. On top of that the open rooftop is incredible and offers awesome views of downtown. Unfortunately for me the food just isn't as inspiring when you factor in the price. I could name a half dozen places where I have spent the same or less and had meals way more incredible than my experiences here. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, in fact it's more like what I consider good but the price to value ratio kind of kills it for me.

I met up with a friend of a friend for a TedX Nashville mixer and drove into \"the Gulch\". Virago is like a t-shirt millionaire. From the outside, he don't look like much, but when you go into his house you realize \"Man, this dude is a baller!\" Virago felt like I was climbing into the mind of my boyfriend. He loves modern design and he would have thought Virago to be only one word: Sick. Not in a bad, \"she looks sick like anorexic Karen Carpenter\" kind of way, but an \"uh your new Bentley is sick and you're getting laid for the rest of your life\" kind of way. The design is gorgeous with clean lines and bits of Jonathan Adler whimsy sprinkled here and there. There are conclaves of seating throughout the venue for meetings or making out with Ryan Gosling. I sampled a bit of the food which ranged from maki sushi to teriyaki turkey balls. I could have stuffed fifty of those balls in my mouth...but I'm a lady. Don't quote me on that one.The staff is very nice and Virago reminds me of something I'd see in LA, except without the douche bags and fake boobs. I do not think that Virago is for everyone, some may think it's too fancy because they prefer a divey bar where the floor is sticky and the bathrooms have no doors. But it's certainly a place I would frequent often if I lived in Nashville and had the chance to make out with Ryan Gosling. It's an \"I wipe my butt with $20 bills\" kind of cool.

And was mistreated by a server and his regular customer! My friend & I were waiting for seats at the bar, because we were told that is the only place for open seating! We were told it was a 15-20 minute wait. However, there was empty booths as you walk toward the bar area, there were empty tables around the bar area, & empty seats in the area where the glass is where you can see the sushi. Ok, now trying to be understanding that the hostess said that these seats noted above are all only sat by reservation only. We opted to go sit at the bar while waiting for our seats. Well we were hanging around the bar waiting for someone to get up and I spotted two ladies getting ready to leave so I start to take off my coat so that we could sit down. As I was walking up to put my things down this crazy woman comes up an just throws her things into one of the chairs we were waiting on. She could't say she didn't know we were waiting for the seats cause she seen us standing near the seats, and plus her and a group of her friends were seated by the far end of the Dj booth on the couch. But, what ultimately pissed me off even more is the server Kyle knows he seen us waiting for these seats! Yet he chose not to say anything to his friend! Why you ask I assume it is a friend, because they hugged and spoke to each other across the bar!! I don't care if she is a freaking regular customer or not. On principal,we should have got those seats and he being in the customer service field should have made the situation right, but no he didn't even apologize. I probably would have even accepted if he he said he would make sure we were seated once two open seats came up! Did I mention he took the other woman' s drink order before mine, and I was there first! So i over hear this crazy woman say to her buddies that she has been coming here for four years like I give a Sh! Then she proceeds to get up telling another one of her friends she can have her seat. So I voiced my opinion that the seat should be ours and she proceeds to say that I don't have to leave. And in response I told her I didn't give a damn if she did or didn't! So she sits right there for the rest of the time. But, before I go I requested to speak to the manager. After explaining to the manager why I was so upset with my visit he says to me, did I tell the bartender (Kyle) that I was waiting for these seats. And in reply I said to the so called manager \"why would I have to tell him if I was standing there behind the seats\"!!! Obviously I was not close up to touch the seats cause I respect people's personal space wanted to give the ladies leaving room enough to put their coats on and gather their purses! And as for that 15-20 minute reservation she called after I left and was in my car pulling out of the parking lot across the street from Whiskey Kitchen! Did I also mention that 4 booths that were once empty we're now seated with people as we were walking out! Even a table in the bar area! Overall, this was the worst cust srvc I have encountered in dining out! I use to tell lots of people about virago! Cause I myself have known about them for 4+ years, but I don't go everyday, every week or weekend because I fortunately have a life outside of the bar!! I have a husband & children, but the one night I decide to take my cousin that has never been to virago and receive this kind of treatment!!! Needless to say I will not be back & anyone else I know I will discourage them going there as well!!! I wouldn't set someone up to potentially be treated with the non caring attitude & behavior I experienced here on Saturday night 2/15/14 around 10 pm. I don't know if they have a GM but trust me if they do I would certainly tell them they need a nice talk with the mgr & the bartender!!

If you are a customer reading this I advise you take your own risk, but in my opinion you can get better sushi somewhere else along with GREAT service to back it up! The best thing going for virago is the decor and the location it's in!! Cause the staff's cust srvc skills is seriously lacking!! Other than that why bother!!! And FYI, another lady that was there was telling my friend & I that she was given the worst bar attention ever! She was seated on the other side of the bar when you first come down the stairs to the bar from the lobby & had been waiting awhile for someone to take her drink order! She had to get up & come over to the side the Dj booth is on in order to give her order for a bottle of wine! Take it from someone who knows! I have been going to them since they were in the building not far from the Boundry & Vandy!! But NEVER AGAIN will they get my business!!

Before you think I am being dramatic....please read my review and judge for yourself. I am good at managing my expectations for a restaurant based on the kind of restaurant. When I am going to Virago, an M Street restaurant, I have high expectations on all levels: decor, service, food.I went here with three other girls for a gf's birthday dinner. Our reservations were for a Monday night since some rolls are half price and there are drink specials. \u00a0The waitress came over and was super friendly. I explained right off the bat (before we even ordered drinks) that I had dietary needs/questions. I could not eat the white sushi rice. Now I know what you're thinking....who goes to a sushi place if they do not want to eat white rice, but it was for a bday. This is why I wanted to get all my questions out of the way with the waitress right up front. I asked if rolls could be made without white rice, if they had brown sushi rice (which I knew was probably a no), etc. They did not have brown rice to substitute which was fine. She said I could order any roll without rice. She even mentioned at one point they could substitute crab mix for the rice. She asked if I wanted the hand roll style as opposed to the regular roll, and I said no thank you. So I ordered a couple rolls off the Monday half off menu. All the other girls ordered as well. A few minutes later, the waitress came back out and apologized because the kitchen informed her that rolls on the half of menu cannot have modifications. She said but you can order any other roll on the regular menu without rice. No big deal, so I did just that. I ordered the octopus appetizer and a roll off the regular menu.In the mean time, everyone else's food comes out. I'm eating my octopus salad and everyone else is eating their rolls. One of the managers (Oleg) brings out the roll I ordered and walks away. I look at it and there is rice in it. So when he was walking back, we stopped him. I explained that my roll was not supposed to have rice on it. He looked confused and said ok and took it away. Shortly after the waitress comes back out. She apologized, said she got confused and thought that I had given up on the \"no rice\" thing. I apologized for the miscommunication and that I still wanted that roll but with no rice. She mentioned using crab mix again to hold it together, I said that was fine. Then she informed me that sushi was now taking 45 minutes to leave the kitchen so it would be 45 minutes before it would be ready. By this time, the other three girls were done eating and I was starving. Naturally I was like can't you bump it to the front of the line since there has been a couple mix ups? She said she could not but that a manager could. We said ok, send a manager over.Over walks Oleg (same guy who brought me the roll initially). Right off the bat I could tell he was on the defense even before anybody started talking. Hey, I used to work in retail and was a manager. I know it is not always fun dealing with customers when they ask to speak to a manager. But at the same time, your job as manager is to deal with customers. His arms are crossed in front of him and he asks what's going on. I explained the whole story to him. His response was \"So what exactly do you want? You can't have sushi without rice? My waitress says she offered you a hand roll and you said no, so what do you want?\" I was a little shocked at the way he was talking to me, but I calmly said that the waitress told me I could have any roll on the menu with no rice. So I guess that's where things got confused. One of the women I was with started to talk, and no joke, he says, \"I'm not talking to you I'm talking to her.\" She then says \"Did you just raise your voice at me?\" He then says \"I can't talk to all of you at the same time I can only talk to her.\" At this point I was appalled. Never experienced anything like this. I don't like when a guy raises his voice at a woman, especially when it is an employee at a restaurant to women that are strangers to him. I decided it just needed to be shut down and we needed to leave. I said \"I don't want to order anything else, cancel my second glass of wine, we are ready for the check. We want to leave.\" He said fine and walked away.I wish someone could have taken a pic of our faces. We were all shocked. This was my first time at Virago. All the girls were like it is not like this normally, I have never experienced anything like this, etc. I felt bad for my friends bday because now she was not having fun.Then the GM, Sean, came over. He was really nice. I explained to him what happened. He apologized on Oleg's behave, tried to offer us a free dessert, etc. We said no thank you we just wanted to leave. He apologized again, we paid our check and left. It would have been nice if they comped the Bday girls glass of wine or something.

As luck would have it the party never showed and we were allowed to sit there over an hr and a half while we drank and enjoyed sushi. Now I ordered the Crazy Monkey and even though I am picky about my sushi I fell in LOVE with this roll! Now nothing I eat compares! So if you are in Nashville and want sushi check it out.

If this was a review of simply the food I would give it a strong 4 Stars, however, tonight's dining experience left much to be desired. My girlfriend and I arrived at the restaurant quite a bit early and decided to see if we could be seated, anticipating that we probably would not be based on the fact we were almost an hour early which is understandable on a Friday night. The group of hostesses at the front told us we couldn't be seated until closer to our reservation time and that they would come find us if any tables opened up. We decided to enjoy some Sake at the bar to pass the time until our table was ready and sat within clear view of the entrance in case anything opened up early. Half an hour prior to our reservation time we noticed multiple tables left open around us that remained open until our reservation time. After noticing the hostesses weren't leaving their post to find anyone I went up to their station to inquire about our table. I was then informed that our table was ready, it just so happened to be one of the ones we observed had been opened for nearly half an hour prior to being seated. Our server, Alexander, was prompt to greet us but his service was completely lacking after the initial contact. After dropping off our water he disappeared for nearly ten minutes before coming back to ask us about drinks and we had to tell him that we wanted to order appetizers before he briskly disappeared again. He eventually returned to take the remainder of our order and deliver our appetizer, a manager had to come clear our empty plates before being able to bring us out our entrees. The manager stopped and commented something to our server in passing which appeared to be over the dirty dishes left on our table for over 5 minutes. The manager soon quickly reappeared with our entrees. The rest of the duration of our meal was spent trying to flag down our waiter for service only to receive service from the waitress in the section next to ours. Our actual server went as far as trying to act busy to avoid giving us any form of addition help. It was clear he was looking to close out his shift and head home.

The first rolls they brought out way earlier than the others. Generally, I prefer to eat my meal all at once, but apparently they felt like serving us shit at different times. After inspecting the first set of rolls that came out, I quickly realized that they came out first because they weren't freshly prepared, they were obviously premade. The rice was all dry and the fish was shitty. Then the other rolls came out, and they were certainly not worth the retarded amount of money charged for them. Listen, I know all the cool motherfuckers on town go to this place and go because they don't care how shitty it is for the money.

I ordered their anniversary roll that was a combination of two of their normal specialty rolls, and they failed to mention that it was basically the same price as both rolls combined.

We sat at a booth table at the upstairs outdoor patio dining area. I LOVE that space- open, private booth tables, great view of downtown. It was a perfect night- no cicadas, cooler than it has been, clear skies.We went at 7pm, and there were plenty of available tables- however, by the time we left around 9pm, the entire area (tables plus bar) were occupied. There were several larger parties as well as smaller couples/groups.We started with the V2 EDAMAME (I get it EVERY Time and i love it every time)- it's wok charred spicy edamame and it's totally addictive. Large bowl of it, and an extra bowl to toss discarded pods. We all shared the bowl, it was gone in no time.we also ordered the SHRIMP SUMMER ROLL- it was slightly crunchy fried on the outside but didn't have a deep fried oily feel. It came with a slightly sweet dipping sauce. Overall though the roll was slightly bland in flavor. I probably wouldn't order it again.I went with something I've never ordered before- the ROBATAYAKI items, I got the tofu and the eggplant. Both were small items, probably would have been better as side orders in accompaniment to a main entree dish or some sushi. Both were good- not amazingly good but not bad. I doubt I'd order either again- although at $4 each they're not pricey. I just feel like they're items I could make at home.in case anyone is wondering (because I didn't know this at the time)- the robatayaki is not grilling by the table. i think i misunderstood the description on the menu and for some reason thought it would be like table-side grilling. It's not- the items are just grilled, come out on a regular plate as usual.My friend ordered the SPICY TUNA ROLL (his stand-by roll at every sushi joint) which was solid. I judge every sushi place by how they make spicy tuna roll- and this was overall good. Not too much extra rice, not too heavy on the mayonnaise but good flavor and spice.He also ordered the CRUNCHY CALIFORNIA roll- I liked it, I think there were tempura flakes which added the crunch but it wasn't dry.The loser dish was the MISO SPINACH that my girl friend ordered- she didn't even finish half of it, and I tried it. Kind of bland and a little too \"spinach-y\" tasting if that makes sense. Not that flavorful.The TANGLED GREENS LETTUCE salad looked great- blue cheese, nuts, light vinaigrette.We also all ordered MOCHI ice cream for dessert (got an assortment of flavors including Lychee, chocolate, vanilla, blueberry- all were delicious, perfectly chilled, chewy and flavorful).In the past I've had THE BOMB ROLL which other reviewers have mentioned- it really is awesome! i looooved it. Can't comment on the drinks because this time (Mon night)- two out of four of us didn't drink. One friend had a Sapporo beer, the other had a glass of red wine.Total check (which we split evenly 4 ways) ended up ~$25 per person including one drink each, splitting appetizers, our individual main dishes/rolls, and dessert. I think that's not bad at all given great views, and sushi meals always tend to be pricey.Overall- a great evening and meal with friends. One complaint would be extreme slow service with getting drinks out and then eventually getting around to ordering food. Our server was sweet and fun so I hate to complain - I think the slow service may have been more to do with few servers out on the rooftop area? My girl friend valet parked which is super easy and convenient and pretty much the way to go (valet is complimentary= free). I parked at a lot across the street, next to Whiskey Kitchen- very few available spots, and we parked in the way back in a very tight spot.ps- other reviews have commented on how they felt under-dressed or this place seems intimidating because of crowd and decor. i would say this shouldn't be a deterrent to anyone nor do I think it's a major issue. The table next to us had patrons with tattoos and very hip alternative clothing. My friends wore jeans and casual shirts (the guys) and the girls had casual sundresses- we didn't feel out of place AT ALL. Maybe the scene is different on a weekend evening or maybe it's different at the indoor dining.This is a place I would DEFINITELY come again- and often.

It's not even the best place to go to if you want to people watch. Virago has an attitude, a bitchy high school attitude. The new location doesn't help. We arrived the night before Thanksgiving for a late dinner at the sushi bar. It's not set up like most bars where you can actually talk with the sushi chef and give him your order. The chefs down in this pit seemed friendly enough, but obviously didn't have the authority to take our order. Instead, at Virago, you wait until the waiter comes by eventually - \u00a0\"Oh, sorry. I was working something out with another server\" - and takes your drink order which then takes another 10 to 15 minutes and then takes your sushi order. Which takes another 20 minutes, even though four chefs were standing around right in front of us with nothing to do.We were there to celebrate a birthday - someone who always gets slighted because her special day falls on Thanksgiving weekend. We told the waiter, just in passing we were celebrating. Needless to say, after acknowledging he heard us, he didn't say another word. Not even a \"Happy Happy.\" We weren't looking for anything, seriously, except a little verbal cheer.As for the food, it was O.K., not great. Special rolls were average at best. The service was awful - waiter was a teacher who acted like he was doing us a favor taking our order. Save your money.

All of the women, including the employees, do not eat at the restaurant. \u00a0I'm not sure that they eat at all with their figures. \u00a0And the seeming prerequisite of 4 to 6 inch heels is crazy talk. \u00a0All of the men are equally of the tall, dark and handsome variety: well shaved and when unshaven it is the most stylish beard that one has ever seen. \u00a0So, take your beautiful body and get on over to Virago if you think you can hang.The seating is great though. \u00a0There are really comfortable couches near the bar for larger groups where you can mingle with your people, have a decent meal (we will get to food in a minute), and chat it up with the beautifuls around you. \u00a0Even the smaller tables are comfortable and placed well so that you never feel like you're in the way and always have a comfortable place to sit and see.The food has two kitchens and two menus: \u00a0sushi and more traditional. All food comes out tapas-style in that as soon as it has been prepared it is delivered to your table - there are no such thing as \"courses\" at Virago. \u00a0The sushi is mediocre compared to what you would get in the cities (NYC and LA) that this place is trying to be; however, it is some of the better sushi in Nashville - not that that says much, I suppose. \u00a0The robotayaki is generally really well done, with the exception of the chicken skin... don't get it. \u00a0But, the prices for the robotayaki feel a little bit steep. \u00a0You pay a lot for presentation I feel. \u00a0The traditional main courses like the Wagyu Sirloin, Wagyu filet, and the Wagyu prime (to which a tempura lobster tail can be added to just about any of them) are all fantastic. \u00a0Wagyu beef is the shiznit. \u00a0The side items is honestly one of the strengths of Virago and one of the few spots on the menu where the price and value equation seems fair. \u00a0I highly recommend the spicy green beans... they are to die for - especially if you like spice / a kick in the pants with your meal.So, here's why I struggle. \u00a0Four stars is \"Yay! I'm a fan\" and Three stars is \"A-OK\". \u00a0Well, I am a fan of their food but not their prices. \u00a0I am a fan of the seating arrangement but not their decor. \u00a0I am a fan of their servers (from a service perspective) but I am not a fan of feeling like I am not one of the pretty people.

(Truth Note: If I had not loved the old Viragos so much and compared the new one to its old self, it may have gotten a 4 stars...just keep that in mind...)I met my husband at the old location of Viragos on my birthday, and it has become a regular tradition for us. What I loved about the old Viragos was that it was super nice, but it wasn't snobby. You could come in and modify an order with chicken or shrimp and the chefs were happy to accomodate. You didn't have to make reservations to get in -- you could always come and sit at the bar and end up being served. You could park \u00a0and didn't have to valet - it was pricey, but not ridiculous. It was a comfortable place - now not so much.Without a reservation, they tell you that there is a 2 hour wait although you literally are staring at open tables galore. I don't know if someone is going in and making reservations that they can't keep, but the old Viragos was not like that. Also, they have taken a lot of the menu and are not willing to substitue or modify it. My husband and I LOVED the stir fry, which is no longer on the menu. They have a lo mein option but it had lamb. I asked if I coud get shrimp instead and I got a big, \"No.\" To me, a restaurant that can't substitute shrimp for lamb is not serving fresh food quality because I know they have shrimp. I was just hoping it wasn't served from a pre-made baggie, but oh well - it wasn't too bad, but it wasn't very good and was even more pricey than the old Viragos. The sushi didn't tase the same either and wasn't as fresh and mouth watering - it tasted just normal. I was crushed. The old Virago is dead and the new one is just not as good...On the upside, the new building that Virago's built is gorgeous and huge! It's worth it to at least go to see how they have it all set up - very Dallas and very modern -- it moved to the Gulch and is Gulch upper class. You can't help but admire its beauty - it has a lot more space in the restaurant and an upper deck patio area that you can reserve for parties - you can't smoke up there, even though it is outside, but the stairs lead down to the main smoking area.

Both are great and worth stopping by here to try.However, making reservations here is an ordeal. You have to leave a message, and they say they will call you back confirming your time.

I'm a New Yorker, recently visited Nashville, taken by old friend to Virago when we settled on wanting sushi. It's not the worst sushi I've ever had by far, & also not the best. I would give this place 3 or even 4 stars except for the fact that this was perhaps the very worst service I have received at any restaurant in my entire lifetime. And I am not exaggerating. The waitress (who looks somewhat like a young Meryl Streep) must be either new or just coming out of a coma. She suggested we get appetizers because we'd not ordered nearly enough for our main course. Wrong. The main courses we ordered were enough for at least FOUR adults (there were only 2 of us). Then (get this), the main courses arrive BEFORE the appetizers (which, in fact, were NEVER served ... waitress said they must've gotten accidentally taken to another table, wtf????). I got a bad feeling when I arrived about 15 min ahead of my friend & was seated & promptly IGNORED the entire time before my friend arrived ... no \"can I get you something to drink?\", nothing. Literally, I had to get up, go to the hostess & ask her to please send somebody to take my drink order ... and STILL it was several minutes of waiting. Then, as my friend & I are wrapping up our dinner, we glance over & see our waitress sitting at a nearby booth, patiently wrapping knives & forks in napkins even before we've finished our meal!! Um, check please???? (Any restaurant that takes service seriously does not have waiters wrapping silverware at a booth while diners are still present, good god, who doesn't know THAT?? Maybe at a diner that's acceptable, but not a serious restaurant.) Look, I know I'm from New York, where a place like this would go under in about 5 minutes w/ this kind of horrendous service. Yes, I get that it is important to \"slow down\" & be patient when visiting the South, & normally I LOVE that things there operate at a more relaxed pace... that is, in fact, part of its charm. But this place takes nightmare service to a whole new level. Plus, it seems to be a bit of a \"scene,\" lots of loud, drunken, screaming girls at every other table.

We always enjoyed their food but they closed down a year or two ago. Then ThaiVille opened up with new owners. Those owners decided to rebrand the restaurant as Bangkokville Thai a few months after opening. We decided to give it a try. We stopped in around noon on Sunday & there was one couple at a different table. Not very busy, but that didn't detour us, I mean it's only been open for about 4 months by my calculations. We were greeted warmly & sat at a table & our drink order was taken. If you'd been to Thai Taste, the interior will be very familiar. They haven't change much. It's a nicely appointed restaurant for the age of the building. As we skimmed the menu (all with pictures), the owner stopped by & introduced himself & told us what dishes were his favorite & how this food is different than the other Thai places in Nashville. We decided on the crab Rangoon as an appetizer, I ordered the Pad Kee Mao & Phillip ordered some kind of pork dish. They've got a lunch & dinner price. There's about two dollars in price difference on the items. I told the server I wanted the lunch portion, seeing as it was lunchtime & I wasn't wanting a huge plate of food. She told us that on the weekends is only dinner portions. I thought that was a little odd but I figured we be getting a huge plate of food. The crab Rangoon came soon after. You can really tell they care about presentation here. They use a lot of flowers carved out of carrots & other vegetables. The crab Rangoon was okay. The won tong paper was really thick so it was kind of hard to bite into. I like it when the paper is more delicate & inside crab stuff is fluffy. The food arrived after we were done with the crab Rangoon. The \"dinner\" portion we got looked more like a lunch portion. I think the lunch/dinner portion on the weekend is probably just to make a few extra bucks. The menu didn't have anything on it about no lunch options on the weekend, however on the website, the new menu says dinner is from 11am-9pm on Saturday & Sunday. I enjoyed the Pad Kee Mao. The noodles were cooked well & the chicken was seasoned. I asked for spicy but it wasn't very spicy so we got the 3 little containers of spices. The bell peppers were a little soft for me.

What I found, was just a slab of meat on my plate I could of cooked up myself. No dressing, no signature sauce, no presentation whatsoever. Very disappointing. The salad bar is a joke. I have never been to a steakhouse and had to create my own salad. I would expect this at Jason's Deli or Wendy's, but not a premier steakhouse. Not to mention, the salad was not fresh and was absent any type of signature toppings or selections.In the end, the dessert was fine. I ordered the sticky toffee pudding.

Really better than I expected from having read some of the other reviews. My 8 oz. filet mignon in particular was tender and cooked just right. I thought my wife's ribeye had slightly less flavor and may have been just a bit on the well done side of medium, but it was pretty darn tasty too. Side - The creamed spinach was fantastic. Many restaurants tend to overload this dish with cream. Sperry's got it just right and made the spinach the star of the show.Value - Sperry's is usually pretty pricey for a Nashville restaurant, but we came on Labor Day when all entrees (except the lobster tails) were half price. That meant instead of spending in the high $20s for excellent steaks, we got them for the low teens. Fantastic value. Plus the salad bar is included with all entrees!

That's hard to beat.(PS - There is a tiny open kitchen visible on the other side of the salad bar. Is all the restaurant's food really emerging from that kitchen? If so, the chef deserves a major award for superior performance under difficult conditions. That said, we were also able to see at least 3 microwaves from our vantage point, which I found slightly disheartening in a fine dining establishment. But am I just being naive here?

The owners keep this old-school restaurant dark, presumably in an attempt to foster an intimate ambiance, but I found myself wanting a flashlight (or a headlight, maybe?) to navigate between the tables, especially when I first entered the restaurant. As my eyes acclimated, I took in the scene -- it looked like the kind of place the Rat Pack might have frequented in an old time movie: dark wood, candle light, 1970's decor. The restaurant actually has been there since the mid 70's, and it's not hard to see why: A focused menu, diligent service, and fantastic food make Sperry's a destination worth revisiting. Most, if not all, entrees at Sperry's come with a trip to the salad bar. I don't always love salad bars -- the worst are usually neglected relics of 1980's remodel jobs -- this one was worth visiting. The salad bar was small, but filled with fresh choices and all the essentials. (Real and varied lettuce types, fresh tomatoes, real bacon, lots of cheese.) I ordered the \"Prince William\" -- (not to be confused with a Prince Albert) -- a blue cheese-stuffed fillet, wrapped with bacon ($26). The blue cheese was mild, but the steak was very solid, over all, and I would recommend it again. My only criticism is that the fillet, a small steak, was served on a large plate, which made it look rather lonely without any side dishes to accompany it. I also ordered the creamed spinach, which was lovely, and tasted more of spinach than of cream, but added an extra $4 to an already expensive bill. My dinner companion ordered another steak (also excellent) with a twice-baked potato, which was ordinary, but acceptable.

King and blues fan, so when the wife and I were walking around downtown Nashville, we came across B.B. King's Blues Club, and I had to stop in. Unfortunately, we had just eaten lunch, so I was in no shape to try their food, however we did hang out at the bar for a few drinks.Very casual, laid-back, and chill place. It has a very old school 1930's vibe to it, and I really wish we had stopped in for some live blues music. It was dead when we came in around 2 pm, but I bet this place gets rocking. Bartender was very friendly and was enjoyable. She informed us they had a 2 for 1 deal going on domestic drafts, wines, and certain mixers- so the wife decided on a glass of wine. I noticed they had Samuel Adams Octoberfest on draft, and I don't care if it was 10 for 1 domestic drafts, I'm going Sam Adams every time. The draft beer selection was actually pretty impressive, and they had a nice wine selection as well.So we just relaxed at the bar for a bit, enjoyed our drinks, and made some conversations with the bartender and enjoyed the blues music being pumped through the speakers. Some Stevie Ray Vaughn kicked on, and I just closed my eyes, sipped my beer, and imagined he was on stage in front of me right then and there. This was a fun little stop. We didn't order any food, but the menu did look pretty good, and the food I saw come out of the kitchen looked (and smelled) great! I can't give a five star review, as I really want to come back and experience the food and some live music, but until then I recommend stopping in for a drink while you're walking around.

A positive: the $5 charge does keep some of the rift raft out and the college kids. On the other hand, the food is so-so, not great, nothing to complain about either. It's typical chain food, maybe a little bit better. Our server (who was good) recommended the meatloaf, which I was reluctant to order as I wanted to order the fried catfish (which I ordered a few years back at their location on Beale St in Memphis). The meatloaf didn't taste like homemade meatloaf. The green beans that came with it tasted like they came out of a can. It was edible and even enjoyable while we listened to a great band. The kitchen was very slow- took 30 minutes to get our food. My friend ordered the pork sandwich, which he enjoyed the BBQ sauce, but wasn't wowed. Jacks (also downtown), he said, blew it away.

We told them we were in a hurry because the concert we were going to was going to start soon (we had been at the restaurant for over an hour and still didn't have anything to eat) So they brought our check out to us, saying this way we could get out faster. We got our check BEFORE our food even came!? I have never experienced anything that tacky. FINALLY our food came, and what do you know? She forgot my order. Even told me she messed up putting it in. So everyone I was with ate, and paid their checks, THEN my food came. I had to eat it pretty fast.

He didn't even come over to the table to check on us, or apologize, just had the shot glasses sent over.Lastly, as I was pulling my wallet out to pay, which our waitress, Ashley, stood next to the table waiting for the payment, which made it really uncomfortable.... comes over to me and apologizes to me for being so rude saying \"well you know my boyfriend cheated on me and blah blah blah...\" So unprofessional!

Despite the obvious personal rule-breaking, I like B.B. King's for 3 reasons:1.) The live music good. For once, you can find a mixture of good classic rock, blues, and funk in one location. In one night I heard Stevie Ray Vaughn, Sam & Dave, and Lynyrd Skynyrd. Only at B.B. King's will you find this.2.) It's not a honky-tonk. Downtown doesn't have a whole lot of options for the non-country music crowd and B.B. King's is a solution to that.3.) The space itself. The 2nd Avenue buildings are as historical as Nashville itself. There's something about rocking out in a venue just a block away from where Andrew Jackson (allegedly) had one of his first duels.If you're downtown and looking to escape the cowboy hats, swing by B.B.

I was staying at the soulless Gaylord so it was a real treat for me to come to BB's soulful blues club. Im gonna break it down for ya. *The Ride There*I bought the shuttle ride from \u00a0the Gaylord to the Wild Horse Saloon and walked to BB's. It was 15 dollars round trip, compared to 50 bucks round \u00a0trip for a taxi.*The Music*I went there on a Monday which apparently is a night that The Stacy Mitchhart Band regularly plays. They were great. They could work a croud, they could work the drums, the sax, the horn, the guitar, the bass, and \u00a0the piano. *The Drinks*I ordered \u00a0the Hoochie Coochie. I loved it. I had 3 of them. I followed it up with a Stella Artois. *The Food*I ordered a simple chicken sandwich with bacon and cheese and some darn fine Bar-B-Que sauce. I subbed the fries for Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was pretty good. The portion could have been larger, and there was a meager substitution charge. But they were good. The portion size may not have been what I wanted, but it was more than I needed. The sandwich with the sauce was D -lish. Ous. Delicious. The sandwich comes with a pickle spear, but my server being the bad a$$ she is snagged me some extra at my request. This brings me to \u00a0the most important section.*The Service *Imagine something really cool that's happened to you like winning a raffle or watching someone pitch a perfect game live. These are some of the many feelings I felt after being served by Kindle. She was prompt, courteous, friendly as all get-out, and cute as a button. A really freaking cute button. She was the cat's purr which I think we can all agree is by far better than the cat's meow. Thank you for your service, Kindle. You deserve a raise.I was so smitten by the music, the food, and Kindle by the end of the night Kindle could have poured Bar-B-Que sauce on me and I would have cooly replied, \"I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience my body or my white shirt has caused your exquisite Bar-B-Que sauce. I assure you such impropriety will never occur again.\"*The Ride Back*The last shuttle leaves at 11:30. I would have loved to have stayed later. I so wanted to take a taxi back to the hotel. But, the band stopped around then, and while the thrill wasn't gone yet, I feared it might soon be. Too much of a good thing, might just be a bad thing.*In Conclusion*Your results may vary, for I surely must have stumbled upon some rare astrological occasion when all the planets and their moons aligned such that if you were to connect them, such connection would spell \"Daniel, the universe loves you. Big Time.\". But, I have never in all my travels been to a place which made me feel so at home (thanks the personable, friendly service of Kindle), and so poignantly home sick (thanks to the immersive talent of The Stacy Mitchart Band).My only regret, is that I forgot to redeem my receipt for my souvenier glass.

Since moving to TN, I have yet to find one that is actually any good - this place is no exception.The sign says \"Authentic Mexican Food\", but it's just the same \u00a0run-of-the-mill Southern imitation Mexican food that every other place serves. Just because a place serves tacos, burritos, enchiladas, and tamales doesn't automatically make it \"authentic Mexican\", it's about how those foods are prepared that make it authentic.Before sounding too negative, I'd like to say that the server was very friendly and did an overall good job. Also, the place was pretty clean and the chips and salsa were good and spicy.Having said that, I ordered a combo plate with a tamale, burrito, and enchilada so I could get a flavor for what they might do best (and I was feeling pretty indecisive). The plate showed up and looked just like any other typical presentation. When I tried each individual item, I noticed that it was very bland and had the texture of anything you would order at Taco Bell. The tamale was soggy and mushy and the beef inside didn't have much seasoning, the burrito was basically just ground beef, lettuce, some cheese, and a bunch of sour cream, and the enchilada, being probably the best thing by comparison, was just OK (probably because it was smothered with sauce to mask any kind of actual flavor). I forced myself to take a couple bites to give it a real chance, but I just was not satisfied at all so I asked the waiter to take it back. At that point, I just picked off my wife's plate of tacos and a side of guacamole. The tacos were just some cheap chicken, cheese, and lettuce (we had to ask for cilantro and corn tortillas instead of flour). The guacamole tasted fake and was probably from a huge tub of pre-made stuff that just gets slopped onto plates as they go out. Like I said, just your run-of-the-mill Mexican joint in the South catering to what's palatable to the greater population instead of bringing some actual culture and new flavors to the area. After finishing up, I looked over my check and saw that my plate that I sent back was still on it, so I asked the waiter and he said they would remove it up front at the register when I pay. I went up to pay and told the cashier about removing the plate and he said that he was going to charge me half-price since it looked like half the plate was eaten and because he \"hadn't heard any other complaints about their food\". That was ridiculous to me and I didn't even try to argue because, having worked on the other side of that situation as a waiter for 3 years, I was appalled and didn't want to lose my composure.

Juliet, and this one, conveniently located around the corner from my mother's house). The food is consistently delicious, and always served quickly. My favorite are the chicken fajitas, which are perfect--flavorful and juicy, and never coated in an oil slick. Hubs only will order the burrito grande, and always with a healthy side of the house-made habanero sauce that would knock out a large pony. It doesn't really matter what you order, though. Everything is fantastic. My mother and I ate here around 2 p.m. on a Tuesday, and it was extremely quiet. Historically, I've found late lunches at the Mt. Juliet location to be similarly peaceful.

I really hate leaving bad reviews, but SERIOUSLY guys, what is going on?? We were seated right away in a half full room where every table had multiple screaming kids. It felt more like a Chucky Cheese (my nightmare) than a stress-free night out. Waiter peppers us with questions before we even sit down. My partner and I try to discuss our orders but end up yelling over all the noise. We contemplate asking to move but we are both really non confrontational and don't want to make a scene. We eventually order cheese dip to start and our entrees. Everything comes pretty quickly and the dip and salsa are decent. For the price, its actually pretty good. After we get our plates, his quesadilla doesn't come with any peppers and he mentions how he likes the quesadillas I make much better. My order is wrong and I try to flag down the waiter but he's disappeared by then...for awhile. I ordered shrimp as a special treat for myself but got chicken instead. Disappointed, but I wasn't opposed to it so I ate it anyway. It was okay - it was basically a ton of chicken fried in a tortilla shell (chimichanga). It was a little greasy and the chicken was a little dry without any other filling, like peppers and onions, etc. so I just poured our leftover cheese sauce on it. Waiter comes back about halfway through and apologizes and asks if its okay if I just keep it and he'll comp me the difference in price. He looks flustered, and I've been in that position as a former server so whatever. Apparently the table behind us also got a couple wrong orders, but they had a different server. Towards the end of the meal he brings me a dollar...um, okay. We wait awhile for the check and he finally comes back and we pay and leave - kids are still screaming in the background. I felt bad for the other couples in there.Pros (kind of) - Its your run of the mill cheap Mexisorta food (which I generally really like)Cons - Screaming kids, spotty service, run of the mill cheap Mexisorta food (not at all authentic)Its nothing special. I wanted to think it was an off night but by judging some of the other reviews, it probably wasn't. Too bad. I would probably only go back if a friend was begging me to go.

I have to admit, I didn't spend much time looking at the decor (I was starving,) but I remember seeing lots of warm woods, old photos and chic, modern touches. On to the food--when you start me off with a plate of pickled veggies, you're on my good side. I don't understand other Yelpers hating on the \"strange variety\" of pickled veggies, considering they were all darn delicious. I also live in Ohio City and pickled veggie plates are the norm... Anyways, follow that up with seeing \"matzo ball soup\" all bright and big on the top of the menu and I'm sold. I ordered a cup, which features one tender, flavorful matzo ball, big hunks of carrot, celery and tender chicken. No wimpy hunks of chicken, either--this was the real, homemade deal. I even found some noodles hiding in there, which immediately reminded me of old Max's Deli in Rocky River and their mish-mosh soup. (Sigh... memories.) The short story? It was delicious. I've heard all sorts of amazing things about the sweet potato fries and sammies here (especially the rueben,) but I didn't make it past the salads. I know--weird right? But they all sounded so damn good! I actually had a hard time deciding, but ended up picking this amazing chicken salad with cilantro lime dressing, pumpkin seeds, peppers and corn. Wow. My Momma ordered the chopped salad. Listen to these ingredients and if you don't start drooling, we can't be friends: organic baby spinach, aged provolone cheese, genoa salami, chickpeas, crisp bacon, mild cherry peppers, marinated red onion, garlic croutons, scallions, hard-boiled egg, creamy garlic vinaigrette.

Granted, this is a Nordstrom's, so it's not as if the place was going to be cheap or tacky.I was very pleasantly surprised.First off, it was *packed* at lunch.

It was a nice touch, but we didn't finish it.None of us had the dailies, but we opted for the salads and the cold and hot sandwiches. Being from California, it was strictly a coincidence that I had the California chicken salad. What can I say? I happen to like fruit in my salad. Butter lettuce was topped with a chicken salad made with currants. And there was a cluster of grapes in addition to the ones already in the salad. Very delicious and satisfying. I was worried that my salad was going to be huge as some of the other diners' plates that passed by us seemed to be. I had nothing to worry about.I also had the garlic fries with aioli. I didn't allow my tablemates to leave until I ate all of that.They had sandwiches and pasta. One person loved the way tea was presented to her; she could not stop raving about her chai. (I think they use Mighty Leaf Tea here.)Service was top notch, friendly, and professional. But it could also be that the server knew that his coworker's mom (who was eating there for the first time) was in our party.

Our waiter was nice overall and tried his hardest and even offered selections that were the restaurants best sellers. We started with the ale battered onion rings with the cocktail sauce. The onion ring batter really needed salt but overall was not bad. The paring with the cocktail sauce was a little off putting flavor wise but was pretty good. Overall we would give them a 3 out of 5.

My partner loved the sandwich, we had to send the fries back (which we rarely ever send food back) \u00a0as they were barely warm. When they came back hot, they were ok flavor wise but still missed something. The roasted chicken had a very crispy skin but had a sauce that was bland and completely underwhelming.

Now I know that is the 3rd time that I have spoken about salt on a dish. I am a pepper person by nature and never put extra seasoning on food because I figure the chef has a reason why they combine the flavors the way they do, but a lack of salt on any dish is such a major error that it is almost unforgivable.

As for my meal, it was okay. I got the Moonshine cheeseburger with a fried egg and braised onions with a side of BBQ chips, which were the blandest chips I've ever had. Should have gone with the fries. The burger was okay, but I blame Nashville's burger establishments (Pharmacy, Gabby's, Burger UP) for making my burger standards very high.The drinks were definitely the best part of the meal. I got the Tennessee Tai (a southern take on the Mai Tai) and the Maple Smash. Both were really tasty and strong. For two cocktails and a burger, my bill (after tip) was $47!

Tennessee liquor tax is by the drink and is 15% and sales tax is 9.25% so it adds up. What doesn't add up is every bar in Nashville includes tax in their drink price, why not here?

They were clearly made in the morning and had been sitting in the fridge since then. They were really really cold and the raisins were strange. The BBQ Pork Potato Skins were recommended. They were a HUGE portion. But they were basically just a lot of mediocre pork on top of regular potato skins. Really bland. My server never really came back around so I couldn't ask for things to spruce it up. The Two-Step Chopped salad was the only thing that was okay. It definitely wasn't a chopped salad - just a regular salad full leafs and all. The sweet and sour onions and goat cheese were trying to hard to be something fancy.

Man was it worth it. So Loveless Cafe is surrounded by a handful of little Loveless shops that well a variety of items such as jams, preserves, bacon, trinkets, tourist souvenirs and clothing. I bought a rather awesome \"Taking Care of Biscuits\" t shirt but one wash turned the large into a Small, so I actually never got to wear it. I'll frame it and hang it on the wall or something. We perused the shops and enjoyed looking at their paintings and souvenirs (mini mason jars are just the darnedest cutest things) and my friend bought a canvas painting of a rather happy looking pig. We named him Wilbur Darnell. Don't ask. But the food. Ohhhhhhh man the food. So the policy is that as long as you stay on the first round (it's all you can eat), you're allowed to take the leftovers home. But once you order seconds of Anything, you are not allowed to take anything from the table home. Luckily, we never even made it out of the first round. Just look at my photo. Hilariously huge spread.But I want to talk about the biscuits. These biscuits make you question your life, the world, the Galaxy and Mother Nature herself. You question religion and the science behind it. You question your upbringing and the girl you decided was worthy of your first kiss. That's how magical these biscuits are. Small, fluffy, chewy, yet airy and buttery (you must butter it--it's phenomenal), these are worth the hype and the rave reviews. Served with four preserves (the blackberry was my personal favorite), you must always order more. The fried chicken. Best. Skillet. Fried. Chicken. Ever. Skillet fried chicken is something every single one of you (even you strange vegan and vegetarian folk) need to try at least once in your life because you will be shocked at just how different it is from regular deep fried. Juicy while maintaining the crisp skin, Loveless has it going on. The pulled pork with corn cakes. Okay the portion was absurd. We each had two helpings and it looked as if a family of six could've enjoyed it afterwards. Needless to say we took it home and enjoyed some delicious leftovers. \u00a0Man was the pork great. Tender, sweet and tangy, with a hint of smoke, it was a favorite of ours. The fried okra was delicious (god I love fried okra), but it could've used a pinch of salt after frying as it was a bit bland. Fried green tomatoes. Best I had the entire week.Mashed potatoes were excellent as was the gravy that accompanied them. I can't stop thinking about the biscuits. I haven't stopped since I left the place.

When we put our name on the list, we were told it would be a 1 hour and 45 minute wait. There are plenty of gift shops to spend money at while you wait on your buzzer to go off.

My husband ordered a few of the same things, but also pancakes. The good: the pancakes were huge and good. The biscuits and homemade jams were tasty. Not drive 30 mins out of my way good, but definitely the best thing I had. The catfish was tasty and I wish I had ordered the catfish supper plate. The bad: the eggs whites weren't completely cooked. I know a little is expected on sunny side up eggs, but I scraped more than I'd like to the side of my plate. The gravy was... weird. My mother-in-law also ordered the white gravy and we both thought there was something about it that was off. I had a couple bites wanting to like it and just couldn't eat it. It didn't taste old or like it had gone bad. It just had a really different flavor than anything I've ever tasted in white gravy. The meh: fried green tomato and pimento cheese biscuit. This was a 60:30:10 pimento cheese:biscuit:tomato ratio so I really only tasted the pimento cheese, which was nowhere near as good as my own homemade pimento cheese.

(get it...? biscuits have jam on them...? sooo....biscuits and jam...? yeaaaaa).The menu is so expensive it's nearly impossible to pick which delicies to scarf down. My usual thing is I want to try as many things as possible at new places so I went with the Biscuit Sampler Platter for $11.99. You can then choose 4 biscuits from: Fried Green Tomato & Pimento Cheese, Barbeque, Country Ham, Fried Chicken, Bacon, Sausage or Steak. I went with the Ham, Chicken, Sausage and Bacon because meat! All were good but let's be real, bacon makes everything better. Actually the plain biscuits with some jam preserves were the best thing of all - even better than my meat between the bread.If you have to wait for a table, they have some cute shops outside the restaurant. Even if you don't have to wait, they are worth a stop in after dining.

I had to control myself and not eat the entire plate prior to ordering non-biscuit food. I ended up ordering the Southern Sampler Platter which came with country ham, bacon, sausage, eggs, and a choice of hash browns or grits. I selected the hash browns which were, frankly, not great. I did try my sister's cheese grits and had an immediate sense of regret due to my choices. Live and learn. My sister ordered the barbecue, which turned out to be pulled pork.

As famished as I was and as warm as these buttery biscuits were, I still instantly acknowledged that they paled in comparison to the biscuits I've fallen in love with at a pie shop back in Chicago. I found the texture of these biscuits to be too uniform throughout. These guys lacked the exterior toasty crunch that only makes you appreciate the soft and crumbly insides that much more. You need that contrast in texture in a top notch biscuit. I was also saddened by the lack of moisture in the biscuit and the much too dry crumb.Biscuit disappointment aside, the omelettes were impressively large and stuffed with ingredients. The pancakes were hearty and the maple syrup was somehow exceptionally tasty. I felt the need to try a half order of their country ham and was surprised by my dislike.

Some relatives from Cali came in to visit so we stopped here after picking them up for the airport. We arrived there at a time that most restaurants aren't that busy; smack dab between lunch and dinner. However it was still an hour wait here, and I'm actually shocked it was *only* an hour given how many people were there. I really liked the building(s) itself. For anyone who doesn't know, the Loveless Cafe and surrounding shops are a converted motel from the 50's. I love places like this; you can tell just by looking at it that it's a relic from the golden age of highway road trips. You almost never see such things anymore, as they've either been torn down or are in complete disrepair because they went out of business after the interstate system was built. The little shops were cool. Touristy but charming. They had quite a few interesting items, as well as some food such as jams and cured meats. I had plenty of time to check them out while waiting on my table.Once we were finally seated, I was quite impressed by the service. Despite being packed to capacity, our server was extremely attentive and very sweet, taking plenty of time to explain the specials and whatnot. I ordered their blue plate special for the day, \"Honeyspice\" chicken or something to that effect. It was a half chicken barbecued with a spicy honey-based sauce. It was absolutely fantastic, as were the turnip greens and okra that accompanied it. The biscuits, for which this place is apparently known, were quite good as well. My girlfriend and I shared a slice of fudge pie for dessert and it was quite delicious. All in all it was a really fun experience, but the wait is long enough that this isn't the sort of place I'd want to go to regularly.

The biscuits were buttery, soft and the jams were all a great accompaniment to the biscuits. They brought 9 for the four of us. We cleared it and then asked for more. My friend asked for a side of gravy to go with it and I don't know why they don't advertise that more often. Biscuits and gravy here should be announced on loudspeaker here in addition to it written in big, neon lights.I ended up ordering the steak biscuits and realized I made a mistake. The steak was a little tough and I should have just gotten one of their breakfast plates. I mean, if I can get as many biscuits as I wanted then I should have gotten something without biscuits in it.

Sounds great but it's more just strings of soggy potatoes covered in melted velveeta. I thought it'd be like a crispy cake with some onion and peppers and bacon fat maybe. But nope. The country ham? Foul. Super grisly and way to salty. 3 of us ordered the ham and all felt that way. On top of the food just not tasting good, we all had some hurting stomachs afterwards.

We went with baby in tow, they were very nice to us and her, the food was quite good (those biscuits do *not* keep,) and I could imagine why some people dream of coming to this place.There were a few vegetarian options available. I ended up getting an omelet and sharing it with my rugrat along with some cheesy hash browns and some biscuits. This place is baby approved as a note.I never made it out there when the biscuit lady was still alive, so I don't know how they compare to the originals, but they were great fresh and solid as a rock unfresh, which may give you valuable clues and insights into how your arteries will fare.Parking is a bit of a pain, always has been, it's a combo of not quite large enough, too much area, and slow exiting.

We decided to travel to Nashville just for the hell of it and because it was cold in Chicago. Next to the sunshine and warm temperature, Loveless was the biggest selling point for us to come on down.We knew what to expect in coming to Loveless. We knew it would be packed and we would have to wait, but did we care? Absolutely not. Good food is worth waiting for, especially when it's on every major list of things you need to see in Nashville. We called ahead which I highly recommend. Once we finally arrived, they were telling people an hour but they only quoted us 30 minutes since we had called and our name was already on the list. (By the time we were leaving they were telling people an hour and a half, so go as early as you can!) Although there's a few shops on the property, it's not enough to kill more than 20 minutes. Loveless is primarily known for the biscuits and they didn't disappoint. I especially loved the peach jam that came with it. I also ordered some sausage gravy for the biscuits, but that was a waste of money -- the free jam was the way to go!Breakfast was great, especially the jalapeno bacon. It wasn't too spicy, but the jalapeno gave it a nice flavor. Also, whoever said their hashbrown casserole was better than Cracker Barrel's wasn't lying. I kept eyeing my husband's hoping he wouldn't eat it. I should have just stole it from him :(Our waiter was so welcoming that it almost made me wish I lived in Nashville so I could hang out with him. When he saw my ID (carded me for my mimosas) and saw that it was an IL license he recommended his favorite places in Nashville for us.

All the jams were fantastic and worked really well with the biscuits (they sell them in their gift shop and at the airport). The fried chicken was perfect and very juicy and our sides (mac and cheese, fried green tomatoes, sweet potatoes, and mashed potatoes) were top-notch. Our waitress even brought over some carrot pudding for us to try for free since she wanted us to like it, which was really nice (and tasty!).

Other times, it's well deserved fame that makes you wish you lived there so you could feast on those dishes to your little heart's content- that's Loveless. Sweet lord, Loveless. I will fantasize about this place until I can come back. When people think of outstanding, southern home cooking this is it. This is stick-to-your-ribs, bad for your arteries but good for your soul food. I will never be able to have a conversation about Nashville again without mentioning Loveless. So what was so good that I am love rambling about this place? -THE BISCUITS. I'm pretty sure angels sing when these come out of the oven. In Pluto's theory of forms, everything on earth is a copy of the perfect form of something in heaven. And I'm pretty sure Loveless biscuits are the ones they have in heaven. They are fluffy, and fresh and perfect. Obviously you need butter and preserves, because you wouldn't want to cut corners on this delicious experience. -BBQ pork omelet (AMAZING. One of the best omelets I've ever had). I ordered it because I knew I couldn't get a BBQ pork omelet in NYC or LA or even in carnivorous Chicago. When in Rome, right? Best decision I've made lately. The pork is so juicy and flavorful, and there was just a hint of BBQ sauce, so the smoky flavor carried the omelet. It was perfect. 5 stars. Will order it again every time. - The hash brown casserole AMAZING cheesy, potatoey, fatty goodness. You couldn't dream up better breakfast potatoes. These are an absolute must. They are the cherry on top of each bite. \u00a0-country fried steak My friend got this and it is the ultimate country fried steak with gravy. She couldn't stop smiling while she was eating.

He promptly brought over their famous biscuits and preserves. While in the south, I've quite enjoyed my biscuits savory-style but these preserves tasted very fresh. They kept us occupied for a while until we decided on what to order. The soup of the day was chicken pot pie, which I couldn't turn down even though I was also anxious to try so many other things. Thus, my friend and I ordered the country sampler with fried chicken, country ham, and pulled pork. We opted for obvious sides of mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The fried chicken drumsticks were delicious and the sides definitely hit the spot. The pulled pork was not my favorite though.Someone else ordered the meatloaf platter with sweet potato and hashbrown casserole sides. He claimed the hashbrown casserole was the best he's had.

I had my eggs fried - medium and a side of hash-brown casserole. I wasn't a fan of the BBQ, however my friend loved it alot and ended up eating most of it. I never touched the hash-brown because of how cheesy it was. My fault, I should had gotten the potatoes instead. The only thing I like in this dish is the eggs, they were cooked to perfection.My friend had the Southern Sampler Breakfast (Country Ham, Sausages, Bacon, and Red-eye gravy. The country ham was so salty that it was hard to taste anything after that. They should add this \"country ham\" to the hypertension risk factors list. The sausages were so dry. We tried to pour the red-eye gravy over it because we weren't sure what was the gravy for...it didn't help. I wouldn't order this. The portions are huge. I could barley finish half of my dish after eating all of those yummy biscuits. Breakfast for two people were more than $30, which is pretty expensive. I suggest share the platter with someone and order A La Carte on the side (for 2 people). I got here around 8 am and there were no waiting lines. I will be back for those heavenly biscuits and try the fried chicken next time! 2013/#58", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 133 reviews", "date": "2013-06-18"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nEric P.\n", "review": "My family had breakfast this Sunday morning and I want to update my review from seven months ago as well as add a fourth star for Loveless Cafe.We arrived around 8:30am and had only a 20 min. wait. It was in the low 40's outside and we were able to wait inside right across from the pie cabinet. People watching is quite good from here and it amazed us how many guests place themselves direct in the single doorway after checking in, making it terrible for those leaving or entering. Not Loveless' fault but certainly a fire hazard and rude.Once seated at a clean and well set four top table in the largest dining room on the East side of the building, our delightful and knowledgeable waitress greeted us and took our drink order. I want to reiterate a point I made in my previous review that the wait staff at Loveless is the absolute best you will find at any Nashville restaurant. Certainly a reason to eat here!Very quickly our drinks arrived along with the biggest plate of hot biscuits, three flavors of preserves and plenty of real butter we remember receiving in many years. Our Waitress took our food order and we chatted briefly. Today we learned that Tom Morales and TomKats Catering no longer has any involvement with Loveless. I noticed a Senior Manager that appeared very professional and maintaining a regular, close review of the wait list. Bravo!!! The lady that seems to always be handling the wait list when we visit Loveless is the weakest link at Loveless so I was thrilled to see a General Manager regularly overseeing her work, asking questions and staying very familiar with the info on the list. Please keep doing this Management!Now to the food. Chocolate chip pancakes that my daughter always orders were perfect and so large she brought some leftovers home. The breakfast steak and eggs my wife ordered were served hot and cooked to order. The steak could be a better grade meat and actually a bit smaller. My guess is the steaks are coming at average grade from a Sysco type supplier and a local area grain fed beef supplier would be a nice improvement for Loveless to consider and make a highlight of the menu. Today I ordered the half-order country ham meal with red-eye gravy, eggs & grits. All cooked just right, served hot and plated perfectly. I got chocolate milk for my drink, a first, and was very pleased that it came in a carton from our local (sadly now owned by Dean) Purity Dairy. This is the same milk I grew up drinking in Nashville from weekly home delivery 50 years ago and it is still the best anywhere! Great choice for your dairy products Loveless. I still want to encourage first time visitors to ask for seating in the original small dining room to the left of the hostess stand. This room gives you the real feel of the original and later the McCabe owned Loveless of the 70's - 90's. Most of all don't be afraid to ask questions and try different foods at Loveless.

They weren't extremely buttery or salty like some of the others I have had in the past. Three types of preserves come with your plate of biscuits: Peach, Blackberry, and Strawberry. The biscuits are delicious on their own but the preserves are so well made, you will want to buy a jar of it to take home. Two simple ingredients go into their preserves, sugar and fruit. Southern Sampler Breakfast - Includes Country Ham, Bacon, Sausage and Eggs. All Breakfast Platters come with your choice of grits or potatoes. The Ham was flavorful but really tough. You will be chewing for a very long time. The red eye gravy was flavorful. The bacon was savory, crispy, and slightly salty. The sausage patties were warm, tender, and seasoned well. The eggs were cooked perfectly, just the way I ordered them- sunny side up. The grits were warm and comforting but a bit too watery for me. French Toast- Hearty slices of Texas toast with loads of cinnamon and sugar. It comes with syrup, but they were delicious on their own.

So, we did!Since the 1940's, Lon and Annie Loveless have been serving chicken and biscuits right from the front door of their house to travelers going to and from Nashville. Eventually, their 'home' became a regularly scheduled stop of travelers, and as such evolved into The Loveless Motel and Caf\u00e9 in 1951.Today, they serve 7000 biscuits a day, and once you've sunk your teeth into the creamy, buttery goodness, you'll know why. They are amazing. They also bring an assortment of fresh made preserves to the table. Yum.I watch a lot of cooking shows, which is ironic, since I don't cook. Our stove is used to store things, suitcases waiting to be used and shoes waiting to be worn. However, from the myriad of cooking shows, I have gleaned that Tennesseans know bar-b-queue, and after visiting, I am convinced. \u00a0Ribs, ribs and more ribs. Ribs slow cooked in a pit. Ribs smoked dry, baked, boiled, broiled, rubbed, doused, simmered and oh so good. The Rib Special of the day at The Loveless, were slow cooked with watermelon; the meat literally falling from the bone. The keys to good ribs, I'm told, are some 'fine swine' and lots of time.Throughout the ages, The Loveless Caf\u00e9 has been a much cherished piece of Nashville culture. In 2004, for the first time in Loveless history, they closed their doors for renovation. When they reopened a few months later, 'folks were standing in line thicker than sausage gravy'.Today The Loveless has been featured on many shows, including Ellen DeGeneres, Today and Good Morning America.

Our excellent waiter brought us a basket of steaming, golden-white puffs (ah, those biscuits), pots of jewel-bright, fruity-fruity strawberry, peach, and blackberry preserves (we finished them off with a spoon), plus the sorghum we'd requested. I suspect Annie Loveless developed her biscuits with sorghum in mind--their pairing beats all I've had in the south. A couple unique items on Loveless Cafe's beverage menu are its moonshine offerings. The watermelon moonshine comes in 2 mason jars, a large one, pink with watermelon juice and chunks, and a mini-jar with an ounce of clear moonshine. Poured together, they produce a refreshing drink, no cloying sweetness.Our orders of watermelon ribs and fried chicken both came with 2 sides, so we ended up with creamed corn (double), macaroni and cheese, and the pot liquor greens. It's good we didn't have to share our sides of the creamed corn--wow, it's light and lovely and (woot, woot!) the recipe is available online. The watermelon ribs are dry-rubbed and smoked, then braised with the nicely tangy sauce and watermelon chunks, a process that gives the chunks a great tomatoey taste and texture. The fried chicken, though, proved why the Loveless Cafe has such an enduring reputation. Make sure at least one person in your party orders it, and make sure he or she shares!And save \u00a0room for dessert.

Call it the arrogance of youth. Call it growing up in Central Florida where tourists are tolerated like mosquitoes and alligators--a part of life, but you don't want to associate with them. \u00a0As I've grown older, I've accepted that when I leave town, I'm a tourist. I do touristy things, I eat touristy food. No, not Ruby Tuesday's or Olive Garden. That's just dumb. But I will mire myself in what is otherwise known as a \"tourist trap.\" And I'll smile and drink overpriced soft drinks and buy the postcard while I'm at it.And thus began mine and my wife's visit to uber tourist trap The Loveless Cafe. \u00a0Originally an old eatery tucked into a motel off the Natchez Trace Parkway, it's since expanded out to the remaining buildings in the motel that now include a food gift shop, a gag-laden trinkets store, a bike shop, an art gallery and a concert hall. You'll be glad for the distractions when you're told to wait an hour (or more) for a table. (Don't worry, the beepers they give you cover the entire grounds.) By the way, since we were eating here on the 4th of July, we were told that the wait wasn't that bad for a weekend.Oy.Nevertheless, we were in full tourist mode and the waiting seemed par for the course. But what were we waiting for? Well, based on our orders, a ham steak with red eye gravy breakfast plate and a Bacon, Lettuce and Fried Green Tomatoes sandwich. \u00a0I honestly wished I could have tried some of the other dishes, but we'd had a huge breakfast and had to order small. (OK, RELATIVELY small.) My BLT was great. The fried green tomato was thick, the outer coating (corn meal) crispy. A few (hipster) places here in ATL also serve this same dish, but the Loveless version beats them by an, ahem, country mile. My greens were tasty, but I prefer mine a little more spicy and a little less sweet. I guess that's what the pepper sauce is for.My wife selected the ham steak. Being gluten-free, she wasn't able to pick from much more of the menu nor was she able to enjoy the biscuits. Nevertheless, the ham steak was thick cut and as salty as you'd expect. The wife, a big coffee fan, ordered the redeye gravy and was alternated pleased and repulsed by it. As a NON-coffee fan, I was just repulsed, but that's just redeye gravy in general and not Loveless' serving.And to the biscuits....as a biscuit connoisseur I can definitely tell you these aren't drop biscuits. The wife's granny, an old southern lady who I think was around during the War of Northern Aggression, taught the wife how to make drop biscuits, so that's her frame of reference. I, on the other hand, am more familiar with the flaky, layered kind and these were THAT version. That said, I love Loveless' biscuits. My wife, gluten-free though she may be, cheated a little and had a nibble. She declared them good (even better with sorghum preserves on them), but not as good as granny's. I've got to disagree. Sorry, Granny-in-law, I know you drop it like it's hot, but I gotta side with Loveless here.

There was a 25 minute wait, but since it's the Loveless and it's Saturday night (and it was gorgeous out), that was no problem...we just explored the property.There's a little shop off to the side that sells ham, bacon, preserves, biscuit mix and various Nashville paraphenalia like you would find if you were getting off the airport. Yeah, it's tourist central, but who really cares - there's a fridge full of bacon. Seriously. Bacon. Fridge. Want. (My sister and I were unsuccessful at convincing my mom to get a \"I'm Not Bashful I'm From Nashville\" sticker for her car).So we moseyed around (because that's what we natives do when we're not line dancing, going to Tootsies and wearing our boots and hats, right? We mosey) and found a nice big porch outside Trace Bikes (which is in one of the shops in the old converted Motel - the Motel portion of the Loveless has been converted into a hipster strip mall) and enjoyed the sun while we waited for the pager to go off.When we went inside...we walked past the screen door that used to be the entrance (and was the last time I was there) and went right...last time I went left.After reviewing the menu (and determining that I wanted breakfast for dinner and you can't convince me otherwise), I got a barbecue pork omelette, thinking a) I like both of those things and b) where else am I going to get that. They brought our biscuits and preserves to the table (if in doubt, use the peach), we fell into a biscuit coma and our food came.While I never ever would have considered putting barbecue into an omelette...it was fantastic (and gigantic)...I'd get it again if there weren't so much more deliciousness waiting for me on the menu in future visits.Because we had determined that we had already gone all-in with this dinner, we ordered dessert. I had banana pudding. It was perfect, with the little bits of banana and soggy vanilla wafer in it...um.

Hell, most days, by the time I've done my morning routine (check emails, read the latest Cracked articles, read the news, shower/dress), it makes more sense to eat an early lunch and just skip breakfast (unhealthy, I know). This is not to say that I don't enjoy breakfast. I loved chowing down on the dining hall's breakfast on weekends when I was in college. I'm always up for a late night trip to IHOP (or WAHO, if I'm south of the Mason-Dixon). I've even been known to whip up big Sunday breakfasts if the mood suits me (homemade pancakes are my go-to, but I've made crepes and ebelskivers and omelets and more). I'm not a fan of early morning breakfasts, but I adore brunch and I enjoy leisurely breakfasts, and when I'm traveling, I'm much more inclined to fit breakfast into my schedule.While visiting Nashville a few weeks ago with my best friend from home, trying out breakfast joints was near the top of our list of things to do. The South knows how to do breakfast and Nashville has a collection of well known breakfast places and diners (including Noshville and Pancake Pantry). The Loveless Cafe is perhaps the best known breakfast place and it's famous for a reason: they serve a delicious breakfast. To be completely honest, we didn't actually dine in the restaurant...we drove out there on a Saturday (after being defeated by the long lines at the Pancake Pantry) with high hopes of finding a seat. Unfortunately, everyone and their mother had the same thought in mind, so when we pulled in, it was a struggle just to find a parking spot, let alone a spot on the restaurant's waiting list. After hearing the wait could be well over an hour, and unable to handle the increasing grumbles of distress from our stomachs, we opted for the take-out option (having been reassured that it would only take about 15 minutes). 30 minutes later (which was not too bad, because the waiting list time was now almost 2 hours), we had two Styrofoam containers filled with breakfast and, as the weather was unusually warm for January, we were able to to take a seat at one of the picnic tables in front of the restaurant. The food was delicious: the eggs were light and fluffy, the biscuits were airy and buttery, the sausage had a nice snap to it, and the jam was sweet. My friend had some sort of concoction of pulled pork and eggs and hash browns and more and enjoyed every forkful. After dining, we roamed around the property, visiting the little shops scattered about (I happily purchased a bag of biscuit mix and apple butter--both ended up being delicious). So, while I can't review the actual dining experience in the restaurant, I can say that the food was excellent and, with its reputation and that whole \"the owner was friends with Paula Deen and a bunch of country stars have eaten there\" thing, it makes sense that it's a busy little place. If you want to dine in, be prepared to wait for a long time. Take-out is a great option and it definitely is quicker than waiting for a table--there are picnic benches around the property, or you could always take it to go. The employees I spoke to were incredibly friendly, despite the craziness going on around them, and they were quick too. The restaurant is a little bit out of the way, but parking is pretty decent and it's not too far from downtown.

Breakfast or brunch at the Loveless is really an all day affair.When the pager finally buzzes you have the opportunity to sample the greatest Southern fare that is served within minutes.

I won't be trying more of them.After lunch, we went to the store and I bought some Cajun-spiced bacon and Piggy Pecans. The bacon was awesome when I made BLT's.The Piggy Pecans are SO YUMMY. They're not crunchy because of all of the stuff they've been dunked in, but the salty bits of bacon with the sweetness of candied pecans is a perfect balance. Eat them solo, they're delicious.

It's delightfully off the beaten path, with a nice down-homey (if a bit commercial) feel. Lots of yelpers have begrudged it that last star, but I say it's worth all five. You just need to know how to do Loveless.Rule #1: Call ahead. Loveless doesn't take reservations, but if you call and say you're on your way they will put your name down for you. It could shave an hour off a really long wait. Yeah, I know it's annoying, but they must be doing something right if they can attract crowds like they do.Rule #2: Order right. There is only one thing as far as I am concerned. Fried. Chicken. The big order. Easily the best I've had that wasn't home-cooked. Crispy, flaky crunchy, salty skin with little crunchy knobs of condensed batter here and there peeled back to reveal brilliant white tender juicy chicken. I want a piece right now. Add three sides (I recommend the gooey awesomeness of hashbrown casserole, greens with vinegar, and...screw it, double hashbrown casserole).

I had the opportunity last week during a spring break trip to Tennessee, and I was not disappointed.The biscuits. Sweet Jesus, the BISCUITS. Light, fluffy, yet firm and chewy. How do they do it? No one but the owners know, apparently. It's like they took the traditional southern biscuit and gave it to the Buddha, who took it to Nirvana and then brought it back to share with the unenlightened. Seriously, I cannot express in words how impressively delicious these biscuits are. Their preserves are nothing to sneeze at either, especially their blackberry preserves, which were rich and had what tasted like a subtle note of cinnamon in it. Their strawberry preservers were also good, but I found the peach preserves to be kind of bland and too sweet, like they'd boiled down canned peaches to make it.I also ordered their meatloaf, fried okra, and greens while my friend ordered the southern fried catfish, sweet potatoes, and fried okra. The meatloaf was moist and excellently seasoned with a tangy tomato sauce on top. The greens were also good, but I got a lot of little crunchies in there with them which lead me to believe that they hadn't rinsed them very well. Their fried okra was crunchy, which is a feat since a lot of fried okra I've ordered at other places has been soggy. The bite of \u00a0fried catfish my friend allowed me to have personified southern tradition. She did say that her sweet potatoes were too sweet, though.In the end, all the food we had here was good, but the biscuits and preserves are definitely the stars of the show. I was so impressed by them that right after we got done eating I waddled over to the adjacent store and bought two jars of preserves and a bag of biscuit mix.

Giving 5 stars to restaurant doesn't happen often so I wanted to make sure my high from eating there had worn off. Well I can honestly say it is still there, and I can't wait until I can find my way back to Nashville to eat at this place again. \u00a0I have lived in the South my entire life and have been raised on a diet of fried chicken, pork products galore, veggies seasoned with meat products, and biscuits. It is always fun to scroll through reviews and see comments such as \"the tea was too sweet\", \"the ham was a bit too salty\", or \"the jams were too sweet\". Those statements shouldn't be uttered in the South unless you want to face a firing squad. I can honestly say this is some of the best food I have ever had in a restaurant setting. Lots of restaurants in the South advertise themselves as \"good Southern cooking\" but few can deliver like Loveless.Our cross country trip from San Diego along I-40 finally reached Nashville and after stopping to visit with some friends we were instructed that we had to visit Loveless Cafe. I liked the fact that this place was located away from the hustle and bustle of the city. We only had to wait around 30 minutes for a table on a Saturday night. I am annoyed at the people that have dinged this place for having to wait a long time. Good food = long waits. If you want a shorter wait then head into the city limits and find a Taco Bell. Loveless Cafe has a nice little business enterprise because while waiting for a table you are free to peruse their Hams and Jams Country Market. I had dropped 75 bucks there before even stepping in the restaurant. Their jams are excellent (strawberry and blueberry are must have). Their pumpkin butter is also very tasty. Make sure to grab a mail order brochure for their Hams and Jams because you will want more after leaving. The store is a little on the small side so expect to bump elbows with fellow customers.After being seated a friendly waitress quickly brought us a piping hot stack of biscuits with preserves. It seems the biscuits are always a highlight of every review. They aren't the best Southern biscuits I have ever had but they are very good. When mass producing biscuits some quality has to be sacrificed. Still the preserves are VERY good and if you haven't purchased some already you will after leaving the restaurant. Just pace yourself or you will be full before your entree comes to the table. \u00a0I had an order of the pit cooked pork barbecue which was tender and flavorful and topped with their homemade BBQ sauce (which can also be purchased). I tasted the sig-o's country fried steak which was equally tasty. I tasted the mashed potatoes, homemade creamed corn, slow cooked green beans, and hashbrown casserole. The cooks didn't hold back on the butter and meat seasoning. No room for dessert but I was ogling the blubbery cobbler at the table over. I can't wait to try their breakfast when I go back. Every single dish I tasted here was phenomenal.This place simply can't be missed if you are visiting Nashville.

It's out on that stretch of Nolensville Rd between Lenox village and Concord rd (its become more popular as of late) So now almost 2 years later went with 2 buddies from work and tried a few of their specialties.Started with their Mezza appetizers, a bit of everything, falafel (one of the best in Nashville!) hummus (super creamy) dolmas, feta and olives with pita. Their grilled chicken is apparently marinated for 36 hours, which makes a world of difference in the flavor and keeping it moist. The gyro meat was nice as well. I had their fruit ice tea that is sweetened only with the fruit, a little sweet for my taste (i'm a non sweet ice tea-er) but you could really taste the fruit.So as if that wasn't enough, we each got a delicious smoothie for the car ride back to work. I had the creamsicle and the other 2 had a fig/peanut butter/berry smoothie.

Each time, the experience has been outstanding. Let me lay out a typical visit for you...When you enter the restaurant, you'll be greeted by an enthusiastic and energetic staff. If you want to dine in, you'll be motioned to a table. Go up to the counter for carry out. You'll be presented with a menu full of Mediterranean treats: gyros, falafel, and hummus are just a few items. They also have delectable drinks: fruit smoothies, bubble tea, and their special fruit tea. I can attest to the bubble and fruit teas, which are made with fresh ingredients while you wait.The food might take a while to get out to you; keep in mind, this isn't really \"fast food.\" Your meal is made AFTER you order it, so you know the food is fresh and hot. When your food is ready, a staff member will bring it out to you or get everything packed up nice and neat so you're ready to go. They'll check on you throughout your time there, making sure you are satisfied and have everything you need.Every item I've had at Blu Fig has been delicious. Here's a list of what I've tried:* Hummus with Pita Bread: The best restaurant hummus I've ever had. Seriously. It's extremely smooth and flavorful, served with a drizzle of olive oil and a couple of black olives in the center. * Gyro meat and chicken (in pita and as a platter): Very tender and tasty. The meats are pulled from a rotating vertical spit and sliced thin. In a gyro, the meat is placed on a bed of lettuce and tomatoes, topped with a tzatziki sauce. As a platter, it is served over saffron rice pilaf with side of pita bread and seasoned chips (extra thick and crispy!) or a salad. * Falafel (in pita and as a platter): Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I have had falafel elsewhere (in Chicago) that is softer than Blu Fig's on the inside, which I prefer, but Blu Fig's falafel has a good texture--not dry and not cakey. Their falafel isn't greasy either, so it seems healthier than some others. I would still like to try Blu Fig's baklava and other favors of bubble tea (I've only had the mango so far). Honestly, I would stop by here every couple of weeks if I had a chance--the food and the friendly atmosphere entice me to keep coming back.

We tried the Lentil Bisque, Plate-O's Delight and a \"Yee-Ro\" Pocket. I subbed a side salad for the chips. The chips looked tasty, but was glad I made the change when I got the food. Their salad is well seasoned, dressing is refreshing, and it includes kalamatas (not those black jarred olives that some local places try to dump on your salad).Everything is made fresh and it tastes like it. It certainly isn't purely authentic Mediterranean, but it's Americanized in a good way. It's not at all like most of the gyros I have eaten either downtown or near Vanderbilt that come in a big fat piece of pita bread with a half cup of sauce spilling all over the place and a bunch of white flavorless tomatoes. I have to disagree with the other reviewers about the flavor. I don't want a bunch of greasy meat on my gyro. Theirs is thinly sliced, crispy on one side and rich in flavor. The wrap is also relatively thin which is exactly how I like it. They don't overdo it on the labin and tahini. You can add more if you're someone who really wants sauce running down your arm while you're trying to eat.The bisque was liquified but still had a nice lentil texture. Also lemon-y without being too acidic. The Plate-O's Delight was a real surprise. It's a briefly pan fried edamame corn succotash finished with a little white wine deglazing. It's nothing fancy, but just tastes great. Tried some baklava for dessert and it was also pretty good. It's also very affordable. \"Yee-Ro\" Pocket is only $5.99 and most of the small plates are under $4. The most expensive item is the $10.99 Salmon Filet. Many of the entree plates are $8.99. More than reasonable for the food quality.Like others I really wish they had falafel and baba ganoush. I'm guessing they could do these well.As other have mentioned this is a small cafe style place. They are limited in the number of seats inside because of only having one bathroom. They said they want to put a couple of tables out on the sidewalk for the spring/summer. While we were there we noticed quite a few people coming in for take out, so that seems like a good option if you're local.Whoever owns this place is lucky to have a couple of the most enthusiastic staff I've almost ever met in a restaurant. The guys who co-manage this place are all about making sure you have a great experience. We placed our order in a short line of a bunch of take out orders, and I think they assumed we wanted it to go. After 10-15 minutes when our food was ready they had a bag ready for us on the counter. I told them we would just eat it here and they apologized at least 5 times. It really wasn't a big deal, but they said they should have asked us and comped us some dessert. I tried to put some extra tip in the tip jar and they swiped the jar off the counter and pleaded with me to keep my money and enjoy the food. Ended up chatting with them a bit after the take out rush subsided and was surprised to find out they weren't the owners. These guys really want to make sure you have a great experience.This is also a bit of a drive for Nashville folks. Probably not so bad if you're near Brentwood.

When we arrived to pick them up it seems there was a miscommunication & they'd only had one ready. So we waited for about 15 minutes for the second burger.

The burger had a nice beef flavor, well seasoned & cooked medium, the way I like it. The burger size itself was small, I don't know if it was because of burger week or that's how they normally are.

Lee, and Jefferson Davis. \u00a0Dotted behind each man are fields of cotton, Souther Belles, and rebel soldiers. \u00a0Needless to say, slavery is not depicted in any of the murals. I could say much about Jackson and Lee, but I will simply concentrate on Davis. \u00a0The first President of the secessionist Confederate States of America was, upon the end of hostilities, indicted for treason. \u00a0Treason, as per the U.S. Constitution is defined very specifically: Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. Davis, though never put on trial out of the Northern spirit of reconciliation, clearly was a traitor against the Union. \u00a0Further, Davis was a vocal proponent of slavery. \u00a0He is quoted as saying: \"\"It [slavery] was established by decree of Almighty God...it is sanctioned in the Bible, in both Testaments, from Genesis to Revelation...it has existed in all ages, has been found among the people of the highest civilization, and in nations of the highest proficiency in the arts...Let the gentleman go to Revelation to learn the decree of God - let him go to the Bible...I said that slavery was sanctioned in the Bible, authorized, regulated, and recognized from Genesis to Revelation...Slavery existed then in the earliest ages, and among the chosen people of God; and in Revelation we are told that it shall exist till the end of time shall come. You find it in the Old and New Testaments - in the prophecies, psalms, and the epistles of Paul; you find it recognized, sanctioned everywhere.\" \u00a0As a principal, I understand the idea of celebrating Southern Heritage. \u00a0But what I do not understand is the idea of celebrating Southern Hate. \u00a0Davis is perhaps the singular human representation of the armed struggle to maintain slavery. \u00a0Indeed, he passionately advocated for slavery as a moral prerogative: \"My own convictions as to negro slavery are strong. It has its evils and abuses...We recognize the negro as God and God's Book and God's Laws, in nature, tell us to recognize him - our inferior, fitted expressly for servitude...You cannot transform the negro into anything one-tenth as useful or as good as what slavery enables them to be.\"What in the world the owners of this restaurant were thinking so blatantly displaying these murals is beyond me. \u00a0I will add, that though there were African American patrons in the restaurant, for whom I felt a pang of remorse that they had to be subjected to the idolization of a racist traitor, there was not a single African American employee there. \u00a0Perhaps I just came at the wrong time. \u00a0But probably not. \u00a0SOUTH might have had good food, I don't know. \u00a0But I do know I will not set foot in there again and I urge all sensible people to avoid becoming complicit in whitewashing the racist history of the Confederacy. Why am I posting this on Yelp? \u00a0At the end of the day, this service allows patrons to communicate with other potential customers and offer a review on the full service of a restaurant or business. \u00a0I can say as a customer, I felt deeply uncomfortable in SOUTH. \u00a0I was horrified that prior to understanding the theme of the restaurant I had invited my African American friend to join me there, and I was deeply saddened at the lack of interest most patrons took in what I thought was nothing short of highly disrespectful decor. \u00a0Point being, potential customers have a right to know what they are stepping into to -- a restaurant with an ideological message behind it.-------I will add one more thing. \u00a0After my experience at SOUTH, and certainly after seeing the bust of Nathaniel Bedford Forrest, the first Grand Wizard of the Klu Klux Klan, in the State Capitol, I don't have any desire to return to Nashville or Tennessee. \u00a0That state needs desperately to exit the 19th century and enter the 21st.

So we get there around 11:30 and they are on a wait list. This is totally understandable as brunch is a busy time. However, neither host could even begin to give an estimate of how long the wait would be, no matter how many different ways I phrased the question. I work in the restaurant industry though so I know how stressful being on a wait can be so we headed to the bar.Look, I get it, no one actually enjoys working a brunch shift, but the attitude of the bar staff was deplorable. I mean, really just surly and rude. All the bartenders looked miserable and they were shooting daggers our way every time they walked past us. But whatever, keep our bottomless mimosas filled and you can be as miserable as you want. To be fair, they kept our drinks filled. After waiting an hour and a half, we were finally shown to our table........Which was conveniently right by the speakers. Speakers that were absolutely BLASTING Bob Marley after Bob Marley song (heard the same song 3 times by the way). My guests and I all had to lean in close to scream so that we could even hear each other. I asked our server if it could be turned down and we were told a flat out \"No.\" That's how management likes it apparently. We order our food, 4 of us got some eggs benedict thing and one got a grilled cheese. About 15 minutes later, our server comes out to tell us that she accidentally rang up 4 of our orders as the wrong thing but \"its basically the same!' We insisted on the food that we had originally ordered, so she said it would be a few more minutes. Then they bring out my friend's grilled cheese so she gets to eat by herself, while we wait for our food. Mind you, this is all occurring while conversation is absolutely impossible due to the blasting music. The food was fine, nothing special.I can't recommend this place.

One one side of 5th Avenue is Subway, with it's Jared-inspired subs heaped with pounds of imported vegetables and funky sauces. For $5 you can get a footlong Italian BMT. But, across 5th, nestled in-between a law firm and a sub-par Tex-Mex joint sits Rae's Gourmet. For all intents and purposes (i.e., eating) it's the only place on this corner that matters. I've been a fan of Rae's for years, but today I decided it had earned a glowing five-star review, complete with all the superlatives and accolades. I don't normally give out 5-star reviews, but Rae's deserves it. It's combination of quality, value, service, and friendliness, makes it a must-visit spot in downtown Nashville. Ask any of the 55,000 downtown employees what they're favorite downtown spots are, and you'll hear Rae's on almost every list. First off, they get all the basics right. Fresh bread, high quality meats and cheeses, and plenty of delicious combinations thereof. I'm a fan of the Angus Po-Boy, which is topped with \"magic mushroom,\" cheese sauce, and tomato (you need a fork to eat it). Also, their take on a Reuben is legit. But even more impressively, they do daily specials, from crab cakes to beer cheese soup. And allow me to pause for a minute to praise this beer cheese soup. Spicy, cheesy, with a hint of lager, it is ri.dic.u.lous. I'm a little sick today, and I think the combo of hot, cheesy, beer-y goodness is nudging me towards healing (insert praise-hands emoji). When you walk into Rae's, you get asked to call your order out from the back of the line. If you've been there before, you get asked if you want what you got last time. If you're a regular, they list your usual choices and ask you to pick. By the time you pay, your food's ready. Yeah. They're that good. You feel just ever-so-slightly cared for in a way that makes you want to come back tomorrow. Don't know what you want? Ask for help. They'll get ya served up right.

It's almost lunch time. Rae's caters to the work crowd and isn't as convenient (hours, location and parking). BUT the product is every bit as magical as you might imagine and definitely worth the time and effort it might take to get there.I came here for a work lunch on a busy Friday. It's location on Union is no fun because you know parking is a pain around this area. [Point of Order: Nashville, we have to talk about viable public transit. It's time and your downtown businesses aren't getting as much as business as they should (see my Ichiban review) because you haven't figured out the transit/parking issue. You're, at least, two years late on this fix it.] Once I looped the block a couple of times and suggested* to a woman who was idling in a parking space that she should move, I was able to come in and see what's happening.There's a huge menu board to the right, once you enter, that's filled with specials, sandwich choices and all other goodies. Depending on the day and time, though, you may have to change your plans. I had crab cakes on my mind but arrived too late to enjoy them. Everything's made fresh and to order. Once it's gone, it's gone. I 'settled' on the Wicked Chicken sandwich, bowl of red beans, pomegranate (hallelujah, holla back!) San Pellegrino, and a huge brownie. Lay off me; I was starving.I didn't have to wait too long before my food was ready and I ready to dig in. Oh, you seat yourself after going to the counter and ordering all the food. My sandwich was a stack of chicken, chipotles, lettuce, tomato, and green chili sauce. If it weren't already hot, I could have had my fill from the hot sauce bar that adorns the pay counter. When I tell you this sandwich was incredible... child, please. I was reat' to testify in Rae'. My red beans (to which I *did* add hot sauce) were the perfect compliment to my behemoth of a sandwich. I tried taking small sips of my soda, as this was a San Pellegrino flavor I'd yet to have. #heavenly I was so stuffed, I couldn't fit my brownie in my belly.

Rae's is the best one of these places you will find.Break it down to the important bits:-Service: When you get to the point where you can order (lots of people love Rae's - not just me, so sometimes there are lines), it's always friendly, always helpful (if you aren't sure about what you want) and always willing to treat you like a human, not just the next combo-ordering meat sack standing in line. Mostly this is Fred who has yet to meet someone he couldn't carry on a conversation with, but the others are just as friendly.-Selection: They can make you lots of things if you just ask, but the choices on their menu are well thought out and are all excellent. Many of my co-workers have had everything on the menu and universally rave at how good everything is made.-Contents: Want to see the ingredients they put into their sandwiches? Look over past the drinks on the left as you come in. Seriously high quality deli meats and cheeses. This is important because a sandwich is truly JUST the sum of it's parts. The bread is also fresh and is one of the best parts of the sandwich (especially when you are having the beer cheese soup).They also cater at Rae's and I've had nothing but excellence in the product they provided to me over the years that I have used them for my events. I recommend Rae's to anyone looking for something besides the run-of-the-mill $5 foot-long. There are plenty of those places downtown willing to take your money for their ten cents worth of ingredients. Go to Rae's because you want a really good sandwich put together by quality people who take pride in their work and their business. My recommendations for sandwiches to try (in order): Reuben, Hot Brown, Black and Blue, Southern Belle, Shrimp Po' Boy.", "location": "\nLebanon, TN\n", "exp": " 6 reviews", "date": "2013-01-29"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nKristen Z.\n", "review": "My co workers and I love this place for a great sandwich! \u00a0We have tried everything menu and Rae's doesn't make a bad soup, salad, or sandwich (cookie or brownie)!! \u00a0Customer service is so friendly and warm...

Still plenty of food and you will not be tempted to eat the whole thing (believe me you will not want to stop.)In addition to fantastic sandwiches they also have a rotating selection of soups and excellent salads, oh and don't forget the fresh brownies. \u00a0The staff is always friendly and will get to know your name if you go often enough. The only downsides is that it can get very crowded during the lunch rush and it is in an out of the way location if you do not work in the downtown area.  It is also only open for lunch but if you order a full sized sandwich you could probably have enough left over for dinner. \u00a0I say probably because I have yet to have enough discipline to stop eating one of their sandwiches. \u00a0Make a special trip or meet a friend downtown, it will be worth it.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 214 reviews", "date": "2010-12-01"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nLisa H.\n", "review": "Folks, a sandwich isn't just a sandwich.

Gourmet Mexican would be the best way to describe this place. When you walk in you'll notice right away the plan is to make it feel like a more upscale Mexican restaurant with a decent size bar and tables/booths in the dining area. I will say generally I am not a fan of booths because I feel cramped but we were able to fit 4 people (2 per side) very comfortably so that was nice. The waitress we had was very informative about the menu and she recommended some of her personal favorites as well as customer favorites. We started off with the guacamole, which the waitress made in front of us at the table asking what ingredients we would like to include with the guacamole. Just the fact they made it in front of you and asked how you wanted the guacamole was pretty impressive plus it was delicious! The chips/salsa are complimentary and the salsas were very tasty and had a little heat to them but were not overwhelming. The food itself (and you can tell right away from looking at the menu) is a little overpriced relatively compared to other Mexican restaurants. Part of the reason some Mexican is awesome is because you'll get a lot of delicious food for a pretty cheap price. I had the Pollo Chipotle Fajitas and they were pretty good but it was definitely not the best fajitas I have ever had.

Parking - it's a good thing they have valet parking because as everyone knows, parking is a nightmare at the Gulch. The interior is very nice, it's described as an upscale Mexican restaurant, but if you were to walk into the restaurant without being told it was a Mexican restaurant, you wouldn't know what the cuisine was. I really enjoyed the lighting in the restaurant. It's not dark, but has some dim areas, it's kind of sexy, if lighting can be sexy. All the materials look high end. It looks like a place that would charge ten dollars for guacamole (which they do). Drinks - I had two of the Cinco Rita which is pretty much a classic margarita. At 13 dollars a piece, they're not cheap but they are strong & served in a large martini shaped glass. It's not a fishbowl margarita glass like a lot of Mexican restaurants do. We were able to preview the ($35) 3 course valentine's Day menu that also had an optional $15 cocktail pairing. Total for valentines day meal with paired drinks would be $50. I'll get to \"value\" in a moment. The Valentine's Especialidad-Starter - I had the Ensalada De Mango, mango with jicama, seasoned pumpkin seeds, grapes, mint & queso fresco with a honey vinaigrette. The salad was fresh & nice. I more so tasted the grapes than anything else. Starter drink - peach berry flaca flip, tequila and fresh lime juice with peach syrup and triple sec, topped with club soda and strawberry flip of DeKuyer Strawberry Pucker. Okay, I'm not a huge fan of sweet drinks, I had a couple sips & had to stop because the sweetness burn was hurting my throat. I don't know if it had sweet & sour mix in it or what, but I wasn't a fan. I looked around the room & most people only had a few drinks of it. Main - Camarones con Pasilla Mango mole, saut\u00e9ed shrimp with spicy mango mole sauce. I enjoyed the 7 shrimp that were served. The mole sauce was good, but they put way too much cilantro on the shrimp & rice. It had about half a plant of cilantro on it. I had to pick most of it off. It was served with a small amount of rice and a scoop of mashed sweet potatoes that had some type of fruit mixed in. Some people at the table thought apple because it was so firm, others thought mangos. No one knew. I know that shrimp is a high dollar item & nowadays you never get that many, & I'm okay with that, but give some more rice. The other options were steak that was served with a huge amount of mashed potatoes & chicken that was served with a large amount of rice. Main drink - passionfruit margarita, Herradura silver tequila, passionfruit syrup, fresh lime. I couldn't drink this. It was way too fake sweet. It had too much sweet & sour mix. It made me want another Cinco Rita. Everyone at my table only had a sip or two of this passion fruit concoction. Dessert - strawberry bu\u00f1uelos, fresh strawberries, whipped cream and vanilla ice cream on cinnamon chips. I think there was a problem in the kitchen, because it was just a fried tortilla with cinnamon and sugar, whipped cream & strawberries. There was no ice cream. I didn't realize the error until halfway through & thought \"this would be good with ice cream.\" I asked around & no one had ice cream with the strawberry dessert. The churro dessert had vanilla & a cinnamon ice cream on it, but the menu made no mention of ice cream with it. Dessert drink - heart warmer, coraz\u00f3n a\u00f1ejo, baileys & coffee. This was my favorite of the paired cocktails. I'm not a hugh coffee drinker, but who doesn't love Baileys & coffee? Service - we were treated like royalty. I don't know if it had to do that it was a room full of food bloggers & bloggers, but we were waited on hand & foot & everyone was very friendly. The chef and general manager came out and spoke with us about the menu and were very engaging. A server named Bethanny was amazing! Valentine's value? If I had paid 50 dollars for what I had, I would've probably given this review a 2 star. The food was good, but not great, two of the drinks were not drinkable. The service was great, it was also a private event.

Cool patio area, large oversized booths and great overall location in the Gultch!Food was tasty and everyone enjoyed what they ordered... So why would I not return??Here is what disappointed me:First off, We opted for the fresh table-side made guacamole. It runs $10. Not unheard of for this type of appetizer. However, they used ONE avocado... Seriously!?!? Second:Our server was rushing us the entire time (in a passive aggressive way) he delivered our main course barely 5 minutes after getting our appetizer and 10 minutes after taking our order. Then he was asking about desert before any of the four of us halfway finished our main course. It didn't stop there! He would continue to stop by and ask us about dessert every 5 minutes! At one point I asked him to give us at least 20 minutes. And he came back again in 5 again...The moral is this:Ambiance/vibe/location: 4Food: 4Service: 2Maybe you'll get a better server.

The problem with places that try to make Mexican food super classy is that they tend to simply make things fussy and lose a lot of the soul that is at the heart of this type of food in the process. The food may look like it's ready for a photoshoot, but if it doesn't taste good, what's the point?There's nothing wrong with the food at Cantina Laredo, but that said, there's nothing especially good about it either. None of the food has the fresh punch of flavors that the best little hole in the wall joints all around Nolensville Road excel at, and even though the food doesn't taste heavy, it is kind of bland. It just doesn't have the depth of flavor that real Mexican food can provide and the prices are sky high... but you're really paying for atmosphere here, since I suspect most people are coming here to see and be seen and down a few naughty beverages during a night out. This place isn't going to satisfy any deep-seated cravings you may have for authentic Mexican food, but I don't think that's the goal. It's definitely got more of at trendy bar vibe to despite all the tables for dining.I've never been offended by anything I have ordered here, but I've never eaten anything that made me think I had to come back and have it again.

Also, the carnitas came with a side of sugar snap peas, which last time I checked were not Mexican so I'm not sure what was going on there. I mean, they were tasty, but I was still confused.In sum, this is food with a Mexican twist that is clearly geared at white people.

Over-priced. Mexican food. Had reservations here for a friend's birthday, and when I arrived, I wasn't sure if any of my party was already there and seated, so I asked the hostess (after waiting on her to finish a call without so much as a smile or head nod to acknowledge me standing right there obviously waiting to ask her a question) to check the list to see if my party had been seated. She said she just seated them, and I asked her in which direction, she said she didn't know, I would have to walk around the restaurant to find them. Call me crazy, but if you are a competent hostess, and you just told me that YOU seated the party yourself, shouldn't you know the layout of the restaurant well enough to know which area holds the tables large enough for a party of 10+? There's nothing I hate more than sitting down to a nice dinner and having some other patron hovering near my table searching for their party, and I didn't want to be that person so I called the phones of a few in my group. Unfortunately, we are not phones out on the table during dinner type of people and the atmosphere in the restaurant is loud, so no once heard their phones. So I was left to roam the restaurant, which I'd never been to before, in search of my party. When I finally found my group, I told them what happened, they said they'd literally only been seated about 3 mins and another friend said the hostess had been dismissive of her as well when she asked if the party had been seated. Dinner: I chose a combination dinner of some sort that had a chile relleno and two other items on it, which I can't recall. It was far overpriced at $18, and something I could get at any other Mexican place in town for $10 or less. Someone at the table insisted that we try the \"made in front of you\" guacamole, so we did. Clearly the ingredients were fresh, but to me there is a benefit to letting guacamole \"rest\" after making it, to let the flavors really have time to mesh. The portion was also ridiculously small for the price. Did you really just make a bowl of guacamole with one avocado for, if I recall, almost $10? Some friends had magaritas which they said were just ok. This place, much like many of the places in the Gulch is all hype and is probably only really appealing to folks who've never ventured far from Nashville and think that pricey=cool.

As it stands, 3 is pushing it though. I'll cut to the chase... Why do I love it? Let's see... 1)Location. Housed smack in the middle of the Gulch which is the new \"urban hotspot\" for upper 20's to upper 30's (and a few beyond). 2)FANTASTIC people-watching. Eye candy is great--you can sit out on the mid-sized patio and watch the inflows of young professionals to hipsters to celebs visit Watermark, Sambuca, Ru Sans, and Urban Outfitters, not to mention the folks that live in Icon and Terazzo (Cantina is actually on the first floor of the Icon). Inside at the bar is just as appealing--never know who you'll see belly up to the sleek, modern design...last time I was there I saw 2 Titans players and one of the guys from ZZ Top who allegedly lives here. Random? Yes. Funny? Heck yes. 3)Well, there is no 3. That concludes what I love about Cantina. Why I don't love it... 1)Drinks. They are overpriced and NOT GOOD. Stay away from the mojitos especially. Very syrupy and WAY too sugary. I am sticking with bottled beer there from now on. Can't mess that up too much. 2)Food. Which unfortunately is a big part of what makes or breaks a restaurant. And it's just not good. They pride themselves on their table-side guacamole, but I've had it once and I've passed on it ever since. It's pricey ($12) and desperately needed salt. We felt like we had to keep adding stuff to it in order for it to have any flavor whatsoever. I had shrimp enchiladas on one visit that just tasted rubbery and fishy (didn't finish them), had the \"special\" once that was some sort of chicken burrito with a white sauce--WAY too thick and rich, and I couldn't even find the chicken--and the last chance I gave Cantina was chicken tacos. BLAND as all get out. Literally, just flour tortillas and unseasoned chicken with a few tomatoes thrown in. And a side of rice that needed seasoning as well. All for about $16. 3)Atmoshphere of the dining area...it's just a huge room with really high ceilings and a bunch of tables. It was so loud we could barely hear our waiter. We all agreed that it was kind of like eating in a hotel lobby. I like the bar area much better--it's a little more intimate and you can actually hear your dining mates talk. All that said though, I'll probably go back just for the people watching and the patio.

One reviewer stated when she visited Zoe's there was food on the floor. Zoe's stays pretty busy due to their popularity. Today I witnessed toddlers dropping food in an attempts to stuff their faces.

I have never had an inclination to believe this or any other Zoe's I have visited was dirty and unfit for dining. And I am a pretty picky person.Secondly, I heard ppl state the food was bland. If you are seeking massive amounts of MSG, sugar, and salt to flavor your food I suggest you visit Krystal's or Burger King. The concept behind Zoe's is healthy, fresh, and wholesome food. I personally still absolutely dig the seasonings they use and the taste of the food as do other reviewers by almost unanimous opinions on Yelp. So please realize their food is an excellent alternative to calorie and fat laden processed food. Better yet, go try it yourself. If you don't like it --- then don't return! :)And whoever reads this --- Zoe's can you please open a location in Smyrna, Tennessee on Sam Ridley Parkway???

I figured it had a dieresis in its name (or umlaut for the more heavy metal-inclined among us) so it should probably be as good, or at least as pretentious as Provence. Zo\u00eb's Kitchen's menu aims for a California/Mediterranean Nouvelle-Cuisine meets fun fast food aesthetic. The offerings heavily rely on grilled chicken breast, i.e. the most bland meat imaginable. I had a Gruben sandwich (grilled Reuben) which came with a choice of side salad and a bag of chips, which is a pretty good deal considering that the sandwiches are not really that big. The sandwich was quite delicious when I started it but got progressively less tasty as I continued eating it, which might just attest to how hungry I was when I got there. I had some major food envy at my dining partner's Greek Salad, which was good, but served with cold pita bread.Also, not being one to pass up some fat-people-food, I tried the Ya-Ya chocolate slab cake (the only dessert they offer) and it completely saved the meal. It tastes vaguely of cake mix but it is covered generously with gooey chocolate frosting which is then covered in... coarse sugar crystals? I don't know if this is a Southern thing I've missed but it is delicious either way.The fountain drink sizes here range from big to ginormous, which I like. It is a charming space, all minimalist plus bright colors (very IKEA) and what appeared to be children's artwork scattered about. It is also, in all fairness, not at all a pretentious place to eat like I thought it would be. I was surprised and mildly annoyed that the food was served on polystyrene plates; the place gives off an impression that it might be a little more environmentally responsible than that. Overall, it was not a terrible meal, but I'm a little bit sad that I didn't get tacos at Baja Fresh instead.

Slow service and not great: the server was nice, but the place was not that busy and it was painstakingly slow, over an hour. Also, it was difficult to get the attention of the staff for simple things like water refills. Finally, when the dessert was brought out dirty plates from our lunch were not taken away and just left at our table.2. Menu items: We came in with a restaurant.com $15 coupon if we spend $30, almost everything we asked for besides our entrees (meat patties, rotis, desserts) they were out of making it super hard to get up to $30. 3. Food: the BBQ chicken and Curry chicken were ok, but the sides were very bland and tasted like processed food (canned green beans and box mashed potatoes). The carrot cake was store bought and drizzled with Hershey's chocolate syrup on the plate, not appealing or a good flavor combo.I went to Jamaica for my honeymoon so was excited to try this place and hopefully get some authentic Jamaican food, but alas was discouraged and I will not return.

I really appreciated how almost everyone greeted us in both languages. This gives the customers the opportunity to choose which language they are most comfortable using, which I appreciate. Service continued to be top notch throughout the night, our waitress was on top of everything and very friendly. We both ordered agua de jamaica, free refills on aguas is a plus. My husband ordered the Torta Cubana and I ordered the Tlacoyos, both were excellent and unique, and neither came with the obligatory runny beans and yellowy rice with occasional peas that always goes uneaten on my plate. However, we will be back to try the pambazo, the quesadilla de flor de calabaza, and maybe even the quesadilla de huitlacoche if we're real brave. We didn't order dessert, but noticed flan, tres leches, platanos, and ---- coctel de frutas!! Which I am also excited about returning to try. They did have a delicious looking breakfast menu which included champurrado, a favorite of mine in cold months and also hard to come by. It appeared that they might have some live music at some point as well, although while we were there it was a little early for that sort of thing, instead there was a big first communion party going on for about 10 or so little girls. My only complaint is that the chips were not homemade, and yes the salsa was a little bland, but this is to be expected from a place serving authentic Mexican food, since chips and salsa aren't authentic Mexican.", "location": "\nKnoxville, TN\n", "exp": " 93 reviews", "date": "2012-06-02"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nCarey James B.\n", "review": "The only REAL Mexican Restarunt in nashville!

Not even just real Mexican food, but even authentic Aztec dishes. I would say that I could die now, but I really want to go back to Fogatas.Virtually all the food at every Mexican restaurant in Nashville I've eaten at tastes exactly the same as every other, and I've eaten at dozens of them. It's like they all share the same gigantic automated kitchen somewhere in Metro Center, where re-fried beans and salsa are stored in enormous silos and then pumped all over town through a network of tubes.And none of it tastes like it's supposed to. I lived in Los Angeles for more than 20 years, and I understand the difference between authentic Mexican and Mexican-American food. Both of the can be great, and neither of them involve cheese dip. Fogatas does Mexican food best.The owner, Junior, actually sat down at my table, and pulling up pictures on his smartphone, explained dishes and ingredients to me that I was not familiar with (which is amazing, considering I have been eating Mexican food all my life)...then he had samples of those foods brought to my table for me to try.Shut the front door! That right there is some fantastic freakin' customer service! I was blown away and the food was off the chain.I sampled two dishes I cannot pronounce. One was made from Corn Smut--like I'm not gonna try something called 'Smut'. Corn Smut (I encourage you to look up a picture) is a fungus that grows on corn. It looks like a big cancerous corn tumor. I really cannot say anything nice about the appearance of corn smut and am convinced that this food was first eaten as some kind of punishment. The corn smut is pureed, which turns it into a loose, black slime. It is cooked with onions and peppers and other spicy stuff and served in a folded, grilled corn tortilla. It did not look delicious. It looked like a baby had pooped into a taco and then sat on it.However, it was delicious. The homemade corn tortillas were freakin' \u00a0fantastic and it was the best tasting smut I had ever had! Smut tastes kind of like pureed mushrooms (which also doesn't sound great, I guess) but it is deeply earthly and salty, kind of like mushroom and miso. Vegetarians in particular would love this dish. It was awesome and I would definitely order it again.I also sampled another Aztec dish that was made with sqash flowers and squash meat, onions and other veggies. It was quite spicy, had a little cheese on it and was also served on a folded grilled tortilla. Fantastic. Again, vegetarians should run, not walk to this restaurant. It was fabulous.The \"sample\" dishes were huge (although according to Junior, they were tiny by comparison to the actual dishes) and I was full, so ordered carnitas to go, which were also quite good, even many hours later.Junior clearly loves to educated people (especially us gringos) about authentic Mexican food. So if you have questions, I wold certainly ask for him. I found the staff very welcoming and the prices were very reasonable.

You get what you pay for, right?! Well, not in this case. I ordered the lasagna with an add on side salad with thousand island dressing and tiramisu which came to a whopping total of $27.59! My food arrived well before the expected delivery time, however, my salad was not included in my bag. I paid with my debit card online, and I believe this is why the driver simply dropped the bag in my hands and left before I had a chance to check the accuracy of my order. I tried to catch him once I realized I was missing food but he was gone and I was too late. I immediately called the restaurant to inform them of the issue and I was assured the driver was going to return with my salad. He did return in a few minutes \u00a0time, however this time, I was given the wrong salad dressing. I called back again to inform them of the second mistake and whomever answered the phone offered to have the correct dressing brought back, but I declined. I simply expressed my dissapointment with not getting what I asked for, twice and nothing was offered to me for my inconvenience, not even an apology. He didn't seem to care and had a \"so what do you want me to do about it\" kind of attitude. On top of all that, my lasagna was not as good as I'd expected, was not worth the high cost and the breadsticks were hard and cold.", "location": "\nGreenbelt, MD\n", "exp": " 7 reviews", "date": "2015-02-19"}, {"rating": "2.0", "name": "\nRoy R.\n", "review": "I had a calzone, I didn't care for it, \u00a0some might, \u00a0it looked fine.

I hate to be so negative but seriously, the bar was a complete joke. My boyfriend and I stood at that bar for about 15 minutes before we were even recognized. There was only one other couple at the bar and they already had drinks in front of them. There was about 4-5 employees/servers/bartenders (?) scurrying back and forth behind the bar like they had no idea what was going on and couldn't see 2 people standing there staring at them. Normally I would speak up and ask for a drink but I wanted to see just how long we would stand there before we were acknowledged. Finally we were acknowledged but it was still over 5 minutes before anyone actually took our order. I asked for a glass of Riesling, which was on the menu, but they were out. I picked another wine and was served a tiny plastic cup of it for $6. WHY it was in a plastic cup, I have no idea. I saw a whole shelf of wine glasses behind the bar. If I had known I would be walking around with a plastic cup of wine like I was at frat party I would have ordered something else. I paid with cash and it took almost another 15 min to get my change. She didn't have enough change in the drawer (I was owed $11) and it literally took like 3 people to handle this terrible change shortage. I watched several people behind the bar talk about money, 2 different people put money into the register, and STILL had to ask for my change after she had clearly forgotten what she was supposed to be doing and apparently couldn't see us still standing there. By the time I finally had a drink in my hand I was already over it but there ARE a couple of nice things I can say about the place. Immediately upon entering we were greeted by a man named Dominique. He shook our hands and welcomed us. Ladies are free until 11 but my bf had to pay a $10 cover which seemed a little steep for what the place had going on. The bar is the first thing you see when you walk in and although small, it's nice and aesthetically pleasing. They just need to FOR REAL step up the service. But enough about that.....The main area of the club is very dark which is cool by me. Lots of nice, modern couches and several tables and chairs. Honestly, it reminded me of the after hours club eXceSs that used to be on Church St. , minus the lovable crackheads, techno music, stray pills, and abandoned blow pops on the floor. This was a more adult (but not old) crowd who clearly had a little more sense. The DJ was playing a great mix of soul and hip hop with lot's of Erykah Badu, Common, and Jill Scott. After the crowd picked up around 10:30 he moved on to more current, mainstream \"hip hop.\" Notice the quotation marks. Overall, this is an OK spot to chill and listen to some good tunes but that whole bar experience really left me with a bad taste in my mouth.

The food is good and the bar drinks are, too.The best part of going there, especially on Friday night, is the crowd. Since I live in the area, there are always friends and acquaintances to see and visit with. Lately I have seen many more young families there which is a good thing. There is usually enough parking on the large lot and they try to patrol it so that patrons of nearby restaurants don't hog it. Our waitress last night was Sarah; she is a recent hire and very good.What's good to eat? My fave, I suppose, is the spaghetti which comes with a salad. I also like the cheeseburgers and the fried bologna sandwich (not on the menu, but they have it) on rye bread. The french fries are great, but I always ask that they be sure they are HOT. I have had \u00a0them too cold - still fresh, but not hot enough.In summation, if you are looking for the fine dining that Nashville is becoming known for, you won't find it here.

Their menu encompasses a wide range of options, mostly in a southern comfort food type styling. \u00a0I'd heard great things about their French fries, so I was sure to make sure I ordered some. \u00a0I found the food here to be a great disappointment. \u00a0There's such a huge emphasis on 'home made' style cooking. \u00a0Their menu states repeatedly how the majority of their sauces and dressings are all made in house from their own recipes. \u00a0I found the food overall to be majorly lacking in flavor. \u00a0Their 'buffalo' sauce had no kick to it at all and the chicken pieces it was served on tasted like cardboard. \u00a0Their fries were obviously hand cut which was great, but they completely lacked seasoning. \u00a0I might as well have been eating raw potato sticks for the amount of flavor they had. \u00a0Their homemade blue cheese was also incredibly bland, which is actually quite a feat as the cheese that comprises blue cheese dressing is pungently flavored in and of itself.My boyfriend had the fish and chips, which was just as lacking in flavor as my meal was. \u00a0I don't even remember what type of fish it was supposed to be, but I remember that it just tasted like fish sticks you could find in the freezer section at your grocery store. \u00a0The single standout was the Mexican cornbread he ordered. \u00a0That was actually quite flavorful and delicious and was cooked perfectly. \u00a0Maybe they'd do better if they slimmed down their menu offerings and stuck to doing a smaller variety of food well instead of a ton of different types mediocriley.We originally came to McCabe's to grab a bite to eat while watching a football game. \u00a0Which would be pretty typical behavior if the place you were going to was actually a pub and not just claiming to be one like McCabe. \u00a0They did in fact have the game on several TVs that were scattered throughout the restaurant, but there was no sound. \u00a0When we inquired as to whether they would turn the volume up so we could hear the game, they said oh no we never have the sound on. \u00a0By this time we had already ordered our food and were stuck there watching a muted TV trying to figure out what was going on. \u00a0As soon as we finished eating we left immediately and went to one of our more regular haunts to watch the rest of the game (which I might add was a fairly important one).Yes McCabe's has a lovely outdoor patio area but it looks out of place and is more suited to drinking coffee in, not drinking a beer. \u00a0Yes their food is mostly homemade and their recipes they cook from are original, but with a serious lack of flavor what does that really matter? \u00a0You can find McCabe's in the Sylvan Park area, which is a neat neighborhood I intend to explore further. \u00a0I just hope some of the other businesses can do a better job of representing this area.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 170 reviews", "date": "2009-01-23"}, {"rating": "2.0", "name": "\nChef X.\n", "review": "I've been eating here for years.

Unfortunately I think my search must continue. When we walked in we were seated right away. There was only 2 tables of people eating and we were seated right behind the loudest, most obnoxious group of Mexican men. Don't get me wrong, I'm not going all rascist here (Im half Hispanic myself) but I guess because they were speaking Spanish they assumed the rest of the restaurant couldn't understand them. I'm sure most people know enough to understand swearing and derogatory words, especially when they wait for the waitress to bend over to clean the tables and the whole group starts laughing. Now I can't hold what that group of men did against the restaurant but I am surprised that nothing was said to them by management. So yeah...my dining experience was a bit awkward and uncomfortable.Now on to the food. We started with Nachos Supremos for an appetizer. We told our server we would be splitting it yet she only brought out one dish and disappeared. The meat was seasoned well and it tasted really good but the set up was a bit awkward. Instead of using diced tomatoes, they put a whole slice on the top which meant we had to cut it up ourselves. Secondly, the toppings weren't cut into smaller pieces so it was hard to scoop onto a chip. The lettuce chunks were huge and the steak was thin but long. But again it all tasted good past that! For the main course I ordered 2 enchiladas w/rice and beans. I had never been here before so I asked the server if we could mix and match enchiladas or if they had to be the same. She said we could mix so I told her I wanted one chicken and one beef. When she brought it out I had a combination of chicken and beef in each one. I didn't realize this is what she did until after she was gone so I had to wait awhile before flagging her down to let her know the mistake that was made. She was able to correct it but it seemed real important to her to explain how she got confused and try to repeat back our whole ordering conversation to justify it. I just smiled and said it was okay but could I please have my food. When she brought it out, she had them on 2 separate plates...not sure why. They could easily fit on one plate and were originally delivered on one plate so...yeah. She hadn't really cleared off our table so I'm looking around like where are we going to fit this. I was able to put them on my original plate and stack the rest. At this point I wanted to put my head down and bang it against the table a few times but I didn't want refried beans in my hair so I was able to resist.I gave this place 3 stars because the food tasted good and they have potential.

That was pretty much the case for my first trip to Gerst Haus. They offer a wide variety of German specialties (bratwurst, knockwurst, sauerbraten, and the like) as well as sides like spaetzle, German fries (which were similar to home fries) and a multitude of other side items. In addition to the standard fare, they also have eats for those who don't wish to journey into Deutschland territory. The beer selection is equally impressive where you can enjoy either a mug, a fishbowl or a pitcher of their tasty hopped treats. On this visit, I tried their knockwurst platter with the spaetzle and German fries for the side (I'd usually throw a non-starch in, but I was curious about those two items that night). The knockwurst was excellent--like a delicious smoked sausage, but not as dense. There was plenty to fill me up there, but I ended up with leftovers that were just as tasty. The German fries were pretty good as well, but I wasn't impressed by the spaetzle. I expected it to be lighter and fluffier than it actually was, but it almost had the taste of flour that hadn't been cooked out completely. If for nothing else, I would go back here for a beer and for the environment. The house polka band kept things lively, and thankfully they took a break every now and then so you could actually hear the conversation going on at your own table.

A review of any German restaurant would be remiss without discussing the beer choices. \u00a0Gerst Haus has well over a dozen different options on tap. \u00a0Most of them are pretty mainstream, but a couple you should try that you might not find at other bars would be the 2012 (a rich black lager) and the Gerst Haus amber lager. \u00a0One observation: \u00a0while you might assume the 16 oz fishbowls are the better deal, it's worth looking at the menu. \u00a0There are a few instances (like the house lager) where the 10 oz price per ounce is actually better.I don't think there's anything we've ordered there that we haven't liked. \u00a0We usually start off with the sausage sampler ($10 on the appetizers menu) that easily could be a meal by itself. \u00a0The plate is full of...yep, you guessed it, lots of different sausages. \u00a0Accompanied by rye bread and a side (the menu has one listed, but they're happy to make substitutions), it's a lot of food.You can go a couple different directions for your entree. \u00a0They offer combination platters where you can try three of their specialties, or if you want to dive into one item you know you love, you can do that too. \u00a0We've had very good luck with the beef stroganoff, the wiener schnitzel (breaded veal), and the j\u00e4eger schnitzel (which tops the wiener schnitzel with a brown mushroom sauce). \u00a0The sides are also excellent -- the red cabbage is sweet and flavorful, and you really can't go wrong with the sp\u00e4tzle. \u00a0You get two sides with your entree; last time, I ordered a double of sp\u00e4tzle and ate it all.Entree prices aren't totally cheap (you're just under $20 for the combination platters, and most of the standalone entree plates seem to be in the $14-$18 range). \u00a0However, the portions are generous, and the flavor's quite good. \u00a0If you've been hankering German food -- or if you've never had it but have been interested in trying it -- I'd highly recommend stopping by the Gerst Haus.", "location": "\nWashington, DC\n", "exp": " 62 reviews", "date": "2011-02-08"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nLindy B.\n", "review": "Ate there with the fam last week for the 2nd time.

They also have different \"meat\" choices such a chicken, fish, ect instead of beef on your burger. We are looking forward to being able to try their happy hour, which we have been told is fantastic. I highly recommend this place to burger lovers anywhere!", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 15 reviews", "date": "2015-09-17"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nBruce K.\n", "review": "I'm not sure where the \"360\" comes from, but the burger part is very clear. 360 Burger is about burgers. Beef, chicken (grilled or fried), turkey, salmon, you call it. Pick your bread and then either choose one of the predetermined \"local favorites\" or go with the extras you want.Beer and \"happier hour\" specials are priced at a nice round $3.60 and I got here in time to get two beers (small ones, but still two of them) in frosty mugs for that nice price. Spirits, wine, mixed drinks are also on the menu.I went right to it with the \"certified grass-fed beef\" and the local favorite that they call \"Pimento and Pig\" which is a good scoop of pimento cheese and two big slices of bacon. With my side of waffle fries, this was a big sized meal and was quite tasty!It's Nashville, so of course there is a stage with local music. And the ladies waiting tables are all very attractive. Because. Fortunately, I got here on a night that the music hadn't started yet which meant that I could enjoy my meal in a bit of peace.", "location": "\nCharlotte, NC\n", "exp": " 5267 reviews", "date": "2015-08-07"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nBrad C.\n", "review": "\"Eat, Drink, and Be Local\", it says on the back of the 360 Burger t-shirts.I am not a drinker, so the offering of a selection of craft beers does not resonate with me and my dinner experience. But the time, money, and space that would have been taken up by such things were better spent on the incredible burgers and other sandwiches coming out of the kitchen at such an unassuming spot outside of Nashville.With a name like 360 Burger, the specialty is not a mystery but the secret that sets this particular place apart is one that is becoming a trend throughout the country: a commitment to fresh, local ingredients. Fresh ingredients, prepared correctly, simply taste different, and in the best way possible. Those who know and love food, especially burgers, cannot be disappointed. \u00a0The beef for the burgers at 360 is touted as \"certified grass-fed, DNA-trackable beef\". Once again, taste the difference. The beef is expertly prepared, no matter which burger is being delivered to the table, and the flavor that comes through is one that cannot be duplicated at a national chain, much less a fast food restaurant that is accessible on every city block. The added touch is the selection of breads available for each burger, ranging from a classic brioche bun to a delicious pretzel bun to Texas Toast or a fresh croissant. Burger King may tell people they can have it their way, but 360 Burger delivers on that statement in a far bigger and better fashion.The Bacon Basil Pesto burger is one of the more unique flavor combinations on the menu, no matter which protein it is paired with (burger, salmon, turkey, or chicken). As a traditional burger, the unmistakable basil pesto is accented by the smoky Applewood bacon and the woody flavor of the Swiss cheese. The Farm Boy is touted as \"breakfast on a bun\", and that statement is not a joke. \u00a0A breakfast burger with ham and a fried egg, pulled together with maple cream cheese on a croissant, the concept is easy and the flavors are bold but the execution is a problem. The croissant is massive, making an already large burger almost unworkable. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, I like a big, messy burger experience. Very quickly, though, the Farm Boy goes from a sloppy burger to a knife-and-fork diner garbage plate, trying to assemble all the pieces together bite by bite, rather than retaining the ability to eat the sandwich by hand. The burger is served on the croissant by default, but Texas Toast is a better option in this instance. But it is delicious no matter what!Carnivores don't just feast on red meat, and the Blackened Salmon is the best option for those who want something a little different. \u00a0Let's face it, salmon is easy to screw up, as is nearly any fish. The salmon at 360 is seasoned and prepared perfectly, and that is what counts. With a brioche bun, lettuce, and tomato, what is already far more than just a fish sandwich is taken to another level with a fresh, rich garlic aioli and is paired beautifully with the buttery salmon and its Cajun seasoning. The Blackened Salmon burger is the best overall option for those seeking a healthy meal packed with a variety of flavors.If eating healthy is not a priority when you walk through the door, forget the menu and order the Slippery Pig. The foundation is what is generally known as a \"Juicy Lucy\" burger, in this instance stuffed with Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses along with bacon bits, then topped with American cheese, more bacon, and garnished with leaf lettuce and tomato. Everything a burger seeks in a burger is present on the Slippery Pig. The pretzel bun and the brioche bun are both excellent choices for the Slippery Pig.Side items may not be a featured dish at a restaurant of any kind, but are worthy of attention when they are so good that they stand out when placed next to an equally impressive entree. \u00a0The sweet potato fries are some of the best I have ever had. Obviously made fresh and not frozen, the fries were crispy and go well with a side of ranch. If your conscience will not allow you to pair a giant burger with a deep fried side, the fresh steamed broccoli was quite good as well.The service was fast, friendly, and attentive. The atmosphere was modern, bright, and features a permanent setup for live music performances that are a weekly fixture. Parking is plentiful and convenient, and the establishment is located next to the Game Galaxy Arcade, sure to be a hit with any video game loving Millennial like myself.Overall, 360 Burger is a gem, and sure to be a hit with every foodie that is in the greater Nashville area. Sadly, it is six hours from my home in southern West Virginia, but with more and more travel in the works in the coming months, every trip to and through Nashville will include a stop at 360 Burger. This place is not just a restaurant, it's a destination for those who consider food to be a personal passion, because those at 360 certainly do, and the evidence shines through on every plate.", "location": "\nBeckley, WV\n", "exp": " 15 reviews", "date": "2015-07-21"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nAsher B.\n", "review": "Real nice burgers + happy hour till 10pm + good live music.I went here the first time and got myself the avocado cilantro burger with house fries.

Maybe because I've seen the 360 Burger sign for a long time, but never the actual restaurant. The restaurant is located at the end of a strip mall. They've got a small patio in front, with 4 tables on it. We walked in & waited to be seated. They didn't have a host & we thought maybe we just seat ourselves, but then our server came over & sat us. It seems that they only had one server and one food runner, but we never waited for anything. Our server was very fast. Inside, they've got a small bar area which probably seats about ten people. They've also got a small stage area for a band. They've got about 8 televisions on the walls. We ate during a March Madness game & the tvs were loud, but understandable. I skimmed the menu and saw they had a mushroom & Swiss burger. It was over. I had to order that. I ordered it with a brioche bun & with waffle fries. It didn't take but about 10 minutes for us to get our food. I ordered mine as medium instead of the usual medium well they cook the burgers & it was cooked to order. The waffle fries were hot & delicious, just needed a little more salt. I was able to try the regular fries and they didn't taste too fresh, maybe they had to cook the waffle fries and therefore they were better. My burger was very juicy. I had to be mindful of that when placing my bun on the plate so I wouldn't get the bun soggy. I was very happy the burger was cooked to order. The meat has a nice flavor, the thing was LOADED with Swiss cheese & mushrooms which made me very happy. The prices are very reasonable. I think both of our burgers were 10 bucks each & came with a lot of fries.

Parking is good because it's in a strip mall, so no worries there.For checking in on Yelp, I got a free appetizer. Yay! So we opted for the fried pickles, which were pretty dang tasty. I had the Cilantro Avocado Burger with sweet potato fries. The men had some other stuff that I can't remember off the top of my head. But we all were in universal agreement that the fries (regular and sweet) were not that good. It's not that they didn't have flavor, but it's almost like they weren't cooked enough, or had been sitting around for a while before we got them. They were just kinda soggy and greasy, which was disappointing.The burger was actually pretty legit. I thought it had some good flavor and a reasonable amount of heat. I'm not tolerant of hardly any spice, and I thought it was just the right amount. I got the burger on the pretzel bun, which I would definitely advise of anyone doing because it was delicious. We didn't have a problem with the order taking that other people seemed to have, so I was happy about that.The service was good. Our waiter (I can never remember their names) was really friendly and even gave me some suggestions when I was trying to pick out a beer, of which they have an extensive variety.

Let me tell you our disappointment when we got home and actually bit into our food. All three orders of fries were soggy and all three orders were bland. My burger had not one bit of spice to it and it's supposed to have habaneros and jalape\u00f1os mixed in. I could've fed it to my 3 year old and he wouldn't have flinched. I don't even believe they used salt and pepper. The only thing I could taste was the bun. I asked my girls how their burger was without telling them anything about mine. Both of them made a face, told me they didn't taste like anything and they'd rather have a burger from Sonic. When a kid says that, that's bad! I will give them a second star because the server taking our order was nice and the inside of the restaurant appeared to be clean. I later asked my group of friends that I meet up with if they've ever tried 360 Burger and if so what did they think.

I spent the morning at Percy Priest Lake Beach. Since I was in the area, I stopped by 360 burger after I heard good things. Wow one of the few times that a restaurant exceeded the hype. Two words: Pretzels Rolls. Amazing. As a Philly native there are few things I enjoy more than a \u00a0soft pretzel. Its one of my must haves as soon as I land in Philly. So I'm skeptical when people try to duplicate it. But 360 burger's pretzel rolls rock. The mix of salty and chewy was the perfect compliment to the juicy delicious burger. I got the basic cheeseburger with grilled onions. IT wasn't basic it was very well seasoned. And it was huge, I took half of it home. The sweet potato fries and aioli mayo were delicious. They were thin cut and crispy but not overdone. So many times when people try to do thin cut fries they overcook them. I was very impressed that these sweet potato fries were perfect. Also got a ton of the fries. Ended up taking about half of them home with my half of a burger. My waiter was friendly and attentive (disclaimer, I came in for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon and the restaurant was not very crowded.). Anyway, he offered my a water to go, which I always appreciate and he got e a lid so I could take the aioli home.

They must have had two waiters for about 30 people. I couldn't believe it. Our burger experience just kept growing worse. We received our appetizer promptly after all it was just queso and chips. Our main grub now that's another story. The only upside is this, they did make good on the 50% off appetizer that is offered through Yelp and because of the extra long wait for our burgers they did give us a free appetizer.

I love the psychedelic decor. We got great service from a super friendly waitress. The Mighty Meaty is a usual part of our order, but today we also decided to try out The Caesar pizza.The Mighty Meaty is your standard meat-lovers pizza: pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, ham, and bacon. It was fantastic as always. This is one of the few places that puts big strips of bacon on their meat lovers, as opposed to crumbled bacon. It's waaaaay better. The crust is almost as enjoyable to eat as the pizza itself (almost).The Caesar pizza was an olive oil and garlic based pizza with pesto chicken, provolone, mozzarella, and feta topped with a Caesar salad and roma tomatoes. It's apparently unique to the Nashville location. Wow, it was phenomenal! I loved the bite of the Caesar dressing and pesto. The chicken was tender and juicy, and the veggies were very fresh.

However, Mellow Mushroom does have the crowding associated with popular bar and grills-if you arrive during meal times without a reservation, be prepared to wait up to an hour. The restaurant goes with a really tacky 1960s psychedelic theme that seems to go over well with some people but not others.

Fortunately, tales of their awesome happy hour forced me to overlook the bad paintings.I am here literally every week. My fellow grad students and I usually come here for happy hour before one of our weekly evening events. We almost always share the Mega Vegetarian, which is quite good. I also quite like the capri sandwich on wheat, as well as the capri appetizer. I've gotten a vegan pizza here before with the Daiya cheese (which I'm convinced the manufacturers named such because it's to die for) and it was really tasty. However, I was disappointed that they only had veggie toppings and no seitan or soyrizo. In response to Marcia M, they almost always have at least plain tofu, because it's one of the main components in the Mega Vegetarian pizza that we get every week. One of the things that I really love about Mellow is that all of their pizza components are flavorful--the dough for the pizza is not bland and the tomato sauce is also good but doesn't overwhelm the pizza. And they are usually generous with their toppings. I know they have pizza by the slice at lunch, but I've never been there early enough to try it. One of the main draws here is their crazy amazing happy hour. Half-priced drafts (a solid selection) from 3-8 M-Th and all day Sunday. Wait-service here is a craps shoot. There's one waitress and one waiter whom I adore and are always on the ball. But almost as often, we get someone who will forget to come back and check on whether we need more drinks or if we're ready for the check. That can be really frustrating when you're on a time crunch especially, which we usually are. Also, once every three times we're here, they are changing out one of the kegs and even though they say it'll be just a minute, one of us ends up waiting an extra 15 minutes for our beer. My advice: if your beer is being swapped, save yourself the trouble and order something else. One other thing I just wanted to let people know about coming with a big group. I tried to arrange a big lunch here for 18 people last month, knowing that they had that back room and that you could reserve it. When I actually tried to do so, there was (I believe) a $50 reservation fee and I was told that the food and drink minimum was $250. The thing is, when you're sharing pizzas, it's not going to cost as much, and if you're coming for lunch, people are probably not going to be ordering drinks.. So I asked if there was any way to reserve one of the side sun-room areas or anything and the response I got was a blanket no. Because of this, we ended up at Pie in the Sky which was very accommodating (though sadly their pizza is not as good).To sum up: the food is good, the drink specials are great, the service is hit or miss.

They really did a great job of decorating the place to whatever this is called. It's nice to see a place really follow through on their intended style.

It's nice to get a microbrew or something more unusual when you come.The hummus appetizer comes with fresh baked pita. I suppose Middle Easterners might not think it's pita, but whatever it is (perhaps pizza crust) is delicious aht hot and steamy. My favorite pizza is the caesar salad pizza with pesto tofu. It originally comes with pesto chicken, but they're super nice about making substitutions for vegetarians. This pizza comes topped with caesar salad, the ultimate for indecisive diners! But seriously, it's an incredible combination (just a little challenging for reheating leftovers). On the other side of the spectrum, I have gone with meat-loving friends who enjoy the meat-lovers pizza, piled with all sorts... So many flavors, and all are good!I will say, it's not thin-crust pizza, but it is more of a pizza of its own class. Delicious, that's for sure!For a regular sized lunch you can split a small pizza (about $12), to save some money. You can also get half a sandwich/hoagie, which is a pretty good amount.

Great spread selection also. I had my mind made up. The Lox on an Everything Bagel. I was definitely not disappointed, as a matter of fact impressed.

Don't let the building (which has a post-apocalyptic aquarium store look to it I cannot adequately describe) or the interior (which is decorated in hipster pseudo-rural funk) fool you, this place makes a mean bagel. They've got the texture nailed perfectly. I'd say it falls between a NY bagel and a Montreal bagel in style. Perfect exterior crunch, interior spongy chewy gluten festival. They are a bit smallish and maybe a little sweeter than a NY style bagel, but only by a small percentage. I tried both the plain and the salted. The plain was excellent and had minimal extraneous flavor, which is a good sign in terms of their cleanliness. A few stray sesame seeds, but nothing serious. The salted was just right. Too many places put waaaaaaay to much salt on a salted bagel. This was just right. They also make all their own cream cheese. I had some smear on one of my plains and it was good, although honestly the cream cheese wouldn't be enough to get me in the door...those bagels would be. The menu looks comprehensive and there are daily changes. They've got sandwiches and other things you can do to your bagel, and some dingy looking seating in sort of a grandma's living room East Nashville hipster dive thing. I don't know. I guess it works. Anyway, this is about the bagels and that's what they do perfectly. I do have one minor quibble. They ask for advanced notice for large orders, but the menu and website are ambitious as to whether this is about the bagels or coffee, or what amount of bagels, etc... Turns out that two dozen plain was the magic number they didn't want to give me. They'd run out they said... Well, the Yankee in me thinks this egalitarianism is very quaint, but bagel stores up north are always first com first served.

We love Krista, who you can find all over East Nashville including brewing Cumberland Kombucha, which I noticed Bagel Face carries. Of course, that means our service was beyond wonderful. I loved the atmosphere and parking was plentiful (again, stark contrasts to Star Bagel). Now on to the bagel. I was a little worried because it is slightly smaller than the Star Bagel, but they more than make up for that with no stingy-ness about cream cheese. I got Poppyseed and garlic/scallion. It was delicious. The texture seemed just right to me, though, I must admit I am no bagel expert. My partner just said surprise him and he got a whole grain bagel and plain cream cheese, which was also delicious! I'm so happy to have found out they have a cafe like environment in East Nashville now where I will probably be spending almost every weekend morning while I'm pregnant.

They are chewy and dense, not cakie or dry, and they are the perfect size (they don't look like they've been inflated with a bicycle pump.)The bagels are wonderful, but the customer service is second to none. \u00a0Before they even opened, they let people in the neighborhood \"taste-test\" them. The owner/baker dropped off bagels at my door-step, and solicited feed back- she wanted the bagels to be perfect before opening her doors. \u00a0The customer service of this place continues today- recently I went in and the credit card machine was down. Instead of refusing the sale of my half dozen bagels, she simply asked me to bring the money, and sent me on my was with my bag full of yummy hot bagels. \u00a0With that gesture, she has earned a customer for life! (Don't worry- I since have repaid my bagel debt). They moved into their new location on Main (YELP: be sure to update, I want to make sure people can get there), with the plans of expanding to a cafe.

One of the problems with the way Americans are eating, in the main, is that if three bites of something are good, 18 bites are better. This is wrong.

I was headed downtown faster than a toupee in a hurricane.

They took away half of the original dance floor to put in more tables, except they were half empty so I'm not sure what the point was. It's nearly impossible to two-step or even slow dance out there, since the limited square footage is covered with drunk college girls and starry-eyed bachelorettes attempting to line dance (even during the regular non-teaching music portions of the evening).FYI, despite the fact that Tennessee is an open-carry state, there are no firearms allowed at Wildhorse.

My biggest disappointment is with the line dancing teacher/host who we have seen on both nights visiting this venue. She says \"y'all\" every two words and it was almost enough to drive my group out of here. Seriously- if you're speaking to a room full of people, have some public speaking skills or at least self awareness. One of the many line dances that were taught were fun/difficult and the rest were super easy. Boring! On songs which we recognized as being line dancing songs, the \"leader\" was either absent, or leading a super simplified version that we yawned at. I understand there are a bunch of tourists and beginners, but it'd be fun to be a bit more challenged. Maybe have two sections going on- one easy and one complex, like on copperhead road, for example. Also, her complete absence during plenty of songs was a hindrance to us because we \"know\" the dances with a little bit of a refresher. The place closed early on Thursday, our first night trying it out, due to lack of activity. I think there would be PLENTY more activity if they were more in touch with what the crowd wants, because whenever dances are being done with \"y'all\" girl, the people flocked to the dance floor. On my second night, I ordered wings and they sucked. Also, the bartender was incredibly rude after he ran off with my order and then came back to confirm my name and I mentioned I had a tab.

It seems like a moderately local spot to go to, which was definitely a plus when we were looking for things to do. When a band isn't playing, a lead dancer goes on the stage and teaches you the moves for the dance. You learn together in a group and then the music plays for you to practice, before the entire song plays. At first, my friends and I were intimidated, but in truly Southern style, a couple of the locals chatted us up and convinced us to go up there. In our group of 3, there was 1 guy and he was truly impressed with how many girls were up there dancing. It was overwhelmingly female and fun for all.We didn't get any food, but had a few drinks which were average and nothing special. But we didn't come for the food!

In general I had just an OKAY experience here. Definitely a tourist trap but worth going to at least once. The decor is pretty awsome! Tons of different funny horses are spread throughout the entire place. Great for taking tons of funny pictures. I wanted to order the Comfortly Jack to drink and wanted it without the souiveniere glass. However, to my dissappntment the waitress told me I cold not purchase just the drink without getting the glass as well, refills are less money if you do decide to get it. I caved because I really wanted the drink itself. It cost me $13.75 for it. Grantit the glass was nice but I didn't want it and the \"signature drink\" was to very good. There is a problem when the drink is huge and you barley have a buzz by the time it's done. My boyfriend just ordered a beer and that too was its a purchase of a souiveniere glass. I get the whole up selling customer thing but to make a costumer get one of those glasses is just stupid if they don't want it. We split two different things, one was the sampler. It came with quesadillas, chicken fingers, fried green tomatoes and fried pickles. My bf hates is allergic to pickles and told the waitress so she added extra chicken fingers with o extra price that was very nice of her. The green tomatoes were soooooooo good! Absolutely loved ! And the chicken fingers were prob the best chicken fingers I have ever had! The quesadilla was just okayyy. We then decided to split the Tennessee BBQ duo . The waitress tried to change our mind and up sell us to the priciest item on their menu the \"Stampede Platter\" ($23.00) \u00a0after we already made up our mind and kept asking if we were sure. Yes lady we are sure! Especially due to the fact that both menu items were the exact same thing but the Platter was slightly bigger. The Duo (17.00) \u00a0came with hickory smoked pork chops and shaved beef brisket. Baked beans co slaw and Texas toast. The baked beans were amazing but the rest of the meal was pretty bland. They had containers of BBQ on the table to add to the meal. I must say while being in Tennesee I had better dinners during my stay here. After dinner we decided to go upstairs and check out the pool tales and air hockey tales. The pool tales were very cheap and not good if your a pool player. The hockey tables were also cheap but fun. Both were free which was great and they had a lot of them. Overall my experience here was just okay like I said.

This place is 3 full levels plus a huge open dance floor, but there was no getting away from the underage revelers as they were everywhere. Hey, I was a teenager once and I understand that teenagers want to have fun too, but I also think that this bar should enforce a curfew like other bars in the area. Something about teenagers having easy access to alcohol and dancing with people more than twice their age doesn't sit well with me. Additionally, after 10 pm an adult should be able to go to a bar for a night of drinks and fun with friends instead of feeling like they're obligated to be a responsible chaperone.In addition, the drinks were absolutely horrible. Their \"drink special\" for the evening was still over $7 and consisted of some cheap-o whiskey and red apple schnapps. Eww. We ended up just ordering a rum and coke and vodka tonic, which were extremely watered-down and still cost $6.75. 2 stars because it IS an impressive-looking venue and the line dancing instructors and house bands have the potential to make for an awesome night out (as long as you're not the only patron of legal drinking age).

Great musicians and the lineup thy have for the summer includes a number of radio favorites. The line dancing was a unique twist to the evening considering we did not find any other bars doing it. They had multiple dancers there to show you the steps. They keep them fairly simple so everyone can pick it up, but spice them up so each one is a little different from the next. The decor with all the horses is pretty cool too and makes for many photo-shoot opportunities.Three stars for food. I was way less than impressed with the meal. The brisket was decent, pulled pork was bland but fell apart nicely, and Kraft makes a wayyyy better Mac and cheese. I think I would have been better off sticking to the apps menu.

The performer Larry Frick and his band was good, but played covers for the simple minds...our simple minds enjoyed some of it just fine. There was a lot of stretching of time by the band, some silly dance contests for tee shirts etc. and the required birthday song for a few people in the audience.

They even have an on-staff dance coach to help the people that like corny stuff (no self respecting real man would do this in public). Good fun for those types of folks.This is definitely a Tourist trap...but then again, Nashville is a street carnival mask on an entire town designed to fleece people and liberate you of your money.The best fun I had in Nashville was listening to some of the street performers and talking to the homeless and desperate trying to win a buck from you.

The breading was OK but tasted too much of the oil.We ordered the BBQ sampler between us two (the server had explained that they were famous for the BBQ). The ribs were good, the chopped pork was fair and the brisket tasted foul, I could not eat it and this was what I was looking forward to.The three sauces they offered were weird. A sweet unremarkable sauce, a \"vinegar sauce\" that was really a mustard based sauce and a \"hot sauce\" that was not hot and had a foreign flavor I could not wrap my head around. None of them went well with any of the BBQ products on the plate.My wife said the black beans and coleslaw sides were fairly good. I did not eat them.The Wildhorse draft beer is good, I enjoyed it probably the most of anything about our experience here. The margaritas were not good, but almost no one makes a good margarita so no surprise. Most people actually have zero concept of what makes a good margarita so places like this sell them easily. We had no other types of drinks here (except a rail whisky before I left, but you cant screw that up).Cover charge was 6 bucks, children 10 or 12. Come on folks, the world does not revolve around your children. These places make money on alcohol; your children hopefully do not drink. Common sense tells you why the cover. Take your kids to Opry...this is a music bar club...and town. Our server was good. Once he knew we weren't your typical tourists looking to pinch a penny at every turn he was our best friend. I gave him a $20 tip on an $87 tab and he shook my hand. Like the struggling people on the street...this was good money spent; servers in towns like this deal with some pretty stupid people and deserve to have a good night once on a while.Wildhorse? Yep, great place for music. But also a corny tourist joint for people that like that stuff. I wish we had gotten a bite to eat elsewhere and bar hopped all night, there were no covers in most of the clubs that night and they were begging for customers this Monday night. I would go to the Wildhorse for a show if we were in town when someone really good is plating there...but eat elsewhere and order beer or simple basic cocktails.FYI folks, you do not have to order the beer in a souvenir glass, you can order pints. All the other cheesy souvenir drinks on the menu are apparently mandatory if you want that drink. If you want a souvenir glass, the drink menu is perfect for you, otherwise order the basics because specialty drinks are usually weak and overpriced almost everywhere...that silly little umbrella or garnish costs you a bunch!", "location": "\nTroy, VA\n", "exp": " 58 reviews", "date": "2013-10-14"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nRikki B.\n", "review": "Ambiance was cool and line dancing lessons were fun but totally underwhelmed by the food.

Not hurried nor untimely. I realized I got myself on to the \"Southern\" speaking tone while placing my order. Multiple large horse-molded statues in a variety of colors somewhat \"leaps and bounds\" while hanging in the air inside this saloon. Like flying horses. I learned that a famous country female singer had herded stampeding cattle on the street leading to the saloons' doors.

It has three floors, a big stage, and an area to dance. I think they rearrange the seating depending on what is going on there. While we ate, there was a dance floor in the front where a woman was teaching line dancing! It was fun. This place also has a huge stage where there are frequent performances.

You would be right. KEEP READING.... If you want to go see a decent selection of live music, this is another venue that fits that mark. Yes, in Nashville there are probably hundreds of places to see live music. But are they all that large format concert experience? I don't think so. The Club: Large format. Three stories. Several bars to keep you happy. The Food: Skip it. They claim to have award winning BBQ. They must have made up that award. If you think their BBQ is good, you probably haven't had anything else. The Bar/Drinks: Typical full bar. Several on tap beer selections but nothing spectacular. If you want hard alcohol you can get that too. Just be prepared to pay for it. Tips: Don't waste your money for a floor seat. Go with the second or third floor balconies and save yourself some money. Get there early if it is someone you really want to see. If you are not with a group, and show up \"late,\" you are going to have the lovely experience of standing outside to get in. THEY LET GROUPS IN FIRST!

The atmosphere is great. It's laid back and on the water. It's really a fun place. However, the food is mediocre at best, especially if you are accustomed to frequenting many of the outstanding restaurants that we now in Nashville. The shrimp (with any dish) are large and seasoned well, but lack any seafood flavor. The calamari is a very small portion and totally overcooked. The drinks and wine are outrageous, and their house wine is Barefoot (yuck). They don't list the wine prices on the list, so I ordered a glass of Kim Crawford chardonnay and realized it was a whopping $12/glass when we got the check...live and learn. Also, since the restaurant is basically completely outside, all of the beer and wine glasses are plastic, which does not keep a drink cold, especially in the heat...stick with the bottled beer. They have a decent selection, and it's cold! The items we've found that are good are the fried lobster appetizer (expensive, but good), seafood nachos, and \u00a0BBQ pork sandwich (which is good and not that expensive--my daughter's favorite).

They're tossed in the dressing and they're HUGE! Definitely enough for 2. The staff are friendly and greet you when you come in the door. I was excited about the Lobster Bisque, but when I tried it, I found it to be extremely salty. This was true for the Ultimate Crab soup as well, so that leads me to believe that all of their soup is over salted. The soup pricing is a bit on the expensive side for what you you get in my opinion. The drink cups are large and they have free refills, but if you don't drink soda or tea when you eat, and you ask for a water cup, they give you a very small cup (about 6oz I think). I'd much rather pay 25 cents for a larger water cup than have to constantly get up for a refill. The only complaint I have about the salads is that someone in the kitchen needs to be retrained about how far down you can cut romaine without ruining it. I've often gotten salads full of lettuce ribs, which in case you've never bitten into one by accident, are extremely bitter. So note to Newks prep staff, the white part of the romaine is for throwing away, not serving! Parking can be a bit of a hassle during high volume times. Overall Newk's gets a green light from me.Update:After a getting a particularly bad salad with lots of lettuce \"ribs\" for a takeout order I picked up one evening shortly before they closed, I decided to call and speak to a manager (Matthew) the next day. AMAZING. He took time to listen to me, and we had a conversation about how he tries to help the staff (most of whom appear to be fairly young) have a sense of pride and accomplishment in the work they do. It was so evident that he truly cares about his staff, and about the reputation of the restaurant. He also went above and beyond to correct the bad experience I'd had the night before.

Som tum (papaya Thai style, ordered crazy ho)t, pork satay, fried chicken wings.

The seafood - not so fresh. Adding a bit of sugar, hot pepper, and fish sauce help but it is missing the body and unctuous mouth feel I expected from this dish. \u00a0The Gwaey theow--noodle soup was pretty good. The broth was pretty good with interesting depth. I ordered pork and expected minced pork which is more the norm but it came with slim chunks of pork -- okay overall. Cilantro and mung bean sprouts thrown in and no basil that you would get with a bowl of pho. The green curry was just too sweet for me and far sweeter than what you would get in Thailand.

Your request is like asking for no Russian dressing on your reuben or hold the chili on that chili dog please. That they did not honor your request could possibly be in your stupid little head. I eat their pad thai all the time with the fish sauce, and it doesn't even taste remotely fishy. Jesus. Stefanie: What did you order? A CHINESE DISH! GOOD LORD! Yes, they serve a variety of dishes to try to appeal to everybody. Ignore the chinese dishes and get the Thai stuff for maximum flavor. Let's be clear about what sort of place this is. It is a small Thai restaurant run by a Thai lady. The ladies in the kitchen vary all the time, and I don't think they adhere to standard recipes. Some ladies like it salty, others more spicy, etc. I prefer it when the owner cooks my food, but what can you do. She's usually manning the cash register. So it is a bit inconsistent at times. Dining in is usually a safer bet. This is a great place to chow down on the cheap, but you have to know what to order. Anything thai is delicious, especially if you ask for it \"Thai-style.\" This ramps up the heat and usually the care the ladies put into the dishes. Basil Chicken thai style is awesome, with lots of thai basil and a fried egg on top. Pad Thai is a bit pedestrian, but it does the job, especially with lots of condiments on them. They keep condiment trays in their fridge, and they can add a lot of excitement to any dish. Peanuts, sugar, chili flakes, hot sauce and these little pickled pepper bits that will blow your tongue off. \u00a0I mean, really hot man. Watch out for those.

Hubby had the ribeye with some amazing blue-cheese sauce, truffled mashed potatoes and wilted greens (that we couldn't identify and forgot to ask...but enjoyed nonetheless). Both dishes were perfectly cooked, tender and delicious. Biggest compliment of the food; my husband, who is not a fan of lamb, tasted it, loved it and claimed he would order it next time we come in.

We ordered a Caesar salad made with shaved Brussels sprouts instead of romaine. It was absolutely delicious but also contained chunks of avocado and, it turns out, a bit of avocado mixed into the dressing. I only had a couple of bites before I noticed and immediately dosed up on Benadryl and Ibuprofen. The staff quickly whipped up a new salad for me. The head chef was not working last night but happened to be there with some friends. He took the time to come over and chat with us and see how we were doing. That was above and beyond nice.

I was glad to enjoy my drink regardless, but it doesn't look good to me when my ID isn't requested. I'm in my 20s, so it isn't attributed to vanity; it's due to being a stickler for the rules.2) This was a date for me and my husband, and we were seated in a booth (yuck) in a room with the loudest table in the restaurant: six people celebrating someone's birthday.

Tasty.. but not for $40. \u00a0One friend had the falafel dinner. This was very tiny as well. Shes a tiny person so a small meal is fine, but this was really tiny.

YES, ROTTEN TOMATOES. \u00a0She sent it back, there were no apologies, the waitress just took it away.When we sat down the waitress suggested the Arugula dinner salad to my other friend. She said she always suggests it and raved about it. So my friend ordered it with grilled chicken on top (an extra $6), which made the salad a total of $17. She was fine with that because she figured it was a dinner salad. WRONG. This salad came on a side dish plate (no joke). It had a thin layer of arugula 3 small pieces/chunks (exactly) of crumbled goat cheese and the chicken on top. needless to say we were really upset. \u00a0When the waitress came over to ask about the food my \"Salad friend\" said how disappointed she was in the size.

I wanted him to take the salad off the bill. \"Salad Friend\" said she would pay for the chicken because she accepted the $6 charge early on, but she felt she was tricked into getting the salad and then lied to.

But my experience is a little different from the average, so this review may be biased in a way. This was the location of the entire reason my dad and I went to Nashville. He was booked to play a show with some of his friends for an old high school buddy of his. \u00a0His buddy was having a company retreat in Nashville and this was the weekend cap on all of the fun and excitement. The show was on the third level, where the big banquet room and stage is located. That part of the experience was fantastic. The room was decorated perfectly and it was a really cozy atmosphere that played well with the performance and vibe of the whole event.We went down to the second level and ate our meal before the show, which was the same as what was catered to the guests. The salad was fantastic, with candied prosciutto and walnuts; the steak and truffle mashed potatoes with asparagus melted in my mouth and I almost cried from excitement (we were staying in Loew's Vanderbilt and I was being taunted by an advertisement for Ruth's Chris Steak House for days at this point); the tiny little bite sized desserts weren't super special, but there was nothing wrong with them either. This is the part of my review that I feel might be different from others because I didn't see a normal menu and this was entirely paid for/part of a planned large-scale dinner. After dinner and before my dad played, we went down to the snazzy little cocktail bar downstairs. THIS is what I loved so much. While the food was mouth-watering, delicious and heavenly, the dirty martinis I had were moan-inducing. They were absolutely delicious and exactly how I like them!

It wasn't one big thing necessarily, but just a number of small things that added up combined with how much people had built the place up.We arrive and are told it will be about an hour to be seated and take a 'buzzer' \u00a0and sit upstairs at a table in the bar. There is a bar tender and server along with one other person. After initially being greeted by the server, it takes her 15 minutes to come back and take our drink order. The drinks were fantastic, except for the part that it took another 15 minutes to get them and they forgot one. 5 Minutes later, and 35 total minutes from being greeted, our drink order is filled.In the meantime, it is approximately 45 degrees outside and they feel the need to have two of their huge windows opened completely. All of us are freezing and upon request of closing the windows, the server appeared annoyed as hell that we would request something so insane. She closed one window.At this point, our server tells us that it would probably be better to order food from the bar, we take her advice for some reason, and are given ONE menu for all of us to share. She finally comes back after us being there an hour to take are order and the crab cake appetizers arrive. I understand that eating at a nicer restaurant, the portion sizes are going to be vastly smaller as they use finer quality ingredients and professional chefs prepare them; however when the entire appetizer can fit on a single table spoon, you've got to be kidding me.Now our food is finally arriving and the waitress still hasn't cleared off our empty drink glasses or the buzzer from earlier. We end up having to clear the table ourselves and put the items on another table. As the food is being given to us, they repeatedly mixed up who got what.Now the food was pretty good. The only complaint is that the 6oz steak was at most 4oz. It tasted great, but I don't see the point in saying it is 6oz. \u00a0Also, my friend got the LBT Pizza, and each slice literally had an inch thick tomato slice on it...seriouslyIn the end, we got pretty good food but with service worse than a Krystal's at 4am on a Friday night in Antioch.That reminds me. About halfway through our dinner, the bar got packed with a number of 'street' people (hood/ghetto) that I have no clue how were even allowed in.So it wasn't one big thing, just a ton of small things.

I've been several times and honestly have never been blown away by the food. It has a modern and fun atmosphere, I'll give Boundr'y that. But, they change the menu fairly often, which can be good or bad, depending on how you look at it. I went Friday night and found, much to my dismay, that my favorite sesame Tuna Nori Roll is now off the menu. In fact, glancing over the menu, I really didn't recognize much on it. My table ordered the humus for a starter, and received about four slices of pita bread to go with it. We asked for more, which they brought. However, at the end of the night they charged us $3.00 extra, for what would amount to half a piece of pita bread. I was going to order the Punchy Pasta, which is basically a pasta primavera, and asked them if I could add shrimp to it. Our server told me \"sure,\" then came back and informed me that they would charge me $8.00 for one shrimp!! Please!!! I ended up ordering the sweet potato falafel, which was good. Very light and just what I wanted. I think think Boundr'y is pretty pricey for what you get. A friend of mine ordered another seafood pasta dish and said it was tasty. But, yet again, they rationed her pasta. She got about 1/2 cup. Between the pita and the pasta we wondered if someone was suggesting we take up the No Carb Diet!They do have a good drink menu. Boundr'y doesn't have too many wines by the glass, but the Shiraz blend I ordered was nice. The bar is large and pretty roomy, so it's a good place to go with a group. They have small plates, large plates, and regular entrees. I suggest ordering several small plates, called \"Tastings\" and share them. If you have 4 people, order 5-6 small plates or 3 large plates.

Our waitress was off-pace and awkward, sheepishly quiet and likely a pity-hire due to family relation or something of the sort. My friend and I waited for my boyfriend to park, and the waitress came over to ask if we wanted ice water. She poured the water, but didn't return for another 5-10 minutes. When she did return, she clearly lacked knowledge of the menu (she named an entree as an appetizer and was unsure if a certain entree's meat was bone-in) and rushed to take our food orders, omitting beverages completely - we had to remind her that yes, we drink more than just water at 8:30pm on a Saturday. After repeated \"check-ins\" during our meal (yes, we're still doing okay), she cleared our plates and let us sit for 10 minutes waiting on the check before she silently set a book in front of each of us. We opened them to review our checks but found dessert menus instead! Again we waited for the waitress to come back so we could exchange the dessert menus for checks... yet she returned with a single check that we had to again ask her to split.The food may have partially redeemed the experience, but although it was delivered promptly and presented well, and although the textures and flavor combinations were creative, it really lacked that extra \"wow\" factor captured by great restaurants. I am by no means a food snob (I'll eat anything), but if I am going to pay $31 for a 4-inch lobster tail, it better knock my socks off. After hearing all the hype surrounding Boundry, I expected a lot more.I am sure that our service experience was incidental considering the friendliness and competence of the rest of Boundry's staff.

Once my husband and I sat at the bar for a quick dinner, and another time I went with a large group and we had a separate room. Dinner with my husband (four stars): We stopped here on our way to a birthday dinner at another restaurant in town that doesn't have gluten free options. My husband and I were the only two bellied up to the bar and we had great service. I explained 1) my gluten allergy, and 2) my love affair with shrimp and grits. I was so hoping I could have the shrimp and grits! The bartender found a waiter who worked there and had a gluten allergy. He came over to me and told me the chef would have to modify the shrimp and grits slightly to make them gf. Yay! The food arrived promptly and it was delicious. I was thankful they went out of their way to ensure I had a gluten free dinner and will definitely come here again (not in a large group - see below). Group dinner (one star): Well, I know it's a challenge to make good food for a large group so I won't be too hard on them. But overall I was very disappointed. My expectations were high after having had a good dinner here with my husband. Everyone was served a Caesar salad and we had a choice of entree. I had a filet with mashed potatoes and a vegetable medley. The salad was just okay. You might be able to make a better one at home yourself. When the filet arrived I cut into it immediately to check how it was cooked. I ordered medium and it was well done. Not a speck of pink in the center. Um, not okay. I called the server over and asked for a new filet cooked medium. I wasn't the only one - two other people at my table got well done filets and had ordered medium rare and medium - but they ate theirs. He brought a new filet, cooked correctly, back on my old plate. Disgusting. And so was the filet. Disgusting, that is. It's definitely not their forte. It had no flavor whatsoever. And the rest of the stuff on my plate was bland. For dessert everyone got a weird plate of cookies. It must not have been good because it was hardly touched. They brought be berries in cream because I needed a gluten free option.

We ordered a cider and beer that were on tap and tried to pick something to order for dinner. Being from California, smoking in restaurant bars is still so foreign to me. Although I tried not to let it bother me, it's kinda gross. We sat surrounded by chain smokers, distracting myself watching the X Games Motocross. We ordered the Queso and the Fish Tacos. They were both meh and tasted like fast food. The queso tasted like watered down cheese with corn in it. I've never had corn in my queso, maybe it was frozen corn when they made it? The Fish Tacos were kinda bland, but the beans and rice were good. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing?We didn't even finish everything.

This is my second time visiting this bar; the first time was solely for drinks. This time around, we came for dinner too. We walked in and found a spot to sit, and our server came right over and asked if we wanted some drinks. We ordered bushwhackers, which were really good, but from the second he walked away, we joked that he didn't seem to \"like\" us. We were all sober and not loud or annoying. It was just obvious he seemed like he didn't have time for us. I ordered the grilled fish of the day (snapper) with fries and cole slaw. The sides were fine and the seasoning on the fish was good. But the fish itself was SO dry and overcooked. I didn't even finish half of it because it was hard to chew and swallow. As far as everyone else's meals, I think they were decent. For the duration of our meal, he didn't check on us or refill our waters. Otherwise I would have told him about the fish. He walked by towards the end of our visit, and we got his attention to ask for a side of dressing. When he brought it back by, he sort of tossed it on the table as he was walking by. When we asked for our checks, he didn't ask how we wanted them split up. We were 4 girls. Obviously you would think he would have known we weren't all on one check. He brought us one check. We figured out what we owed and luckily all had cash so it wasn't a huge deal. While waiting for him to come back with my to-go box, we talked about how he really didn't seem to care at all about how our experience was or remotely check on us so we determined 15% was a fair tip, considering the service was not even worth that. One of the girls collected the money and tallied up the bill and tip. He came by to collect the check and I asked again for a box, to which he replied \"yeah, I forgot.\" We sat for a few minutes and when he came back over, my girlfriend asked if he would take our picture and he said \"no I'm not going to take your picture.\" We thought he was joking and he said \"really I'm not going to. Other than forgetting the to-go box, did I do something wrong? Other than the box, did I do something wrong?\" At this point we were really confused and actually kind of mad that he was being a jerk and my friend said \"well other than this is the most you've talked to us the entire time we've been here.\" He walked away as we sat there with our mouths open. We got up to leave and I couldn't leave without knowing what was going on so myself and one of the other girls went back in and found him. I said \"could you please explain to me what just happened?\" He said \"she left me an 11% tip. I'm not going to take a picture after getting that kind of tip. I have a kid. How could you come into a restaurant and leave that little of a tip?\" So I said \"first of all, that taking a picture thing aside, this whole experience was awkward and rude. Secondly, I don't think she realized she didn't leave you 15% because we even discussed that we were going to leave you 15%. I'm sorry that happened but this was just rude.\" He said \"you don't have to apologize.\" I said \"I think both parties should probably apologize.\" My friend chimed in and told him he shouldn't have acted that way to us and he said \"what, do you think we should be friends at the end of this transaction?\" And she said \"no but you are being incredibly rude\" and she walked out. So I said \"like I said, I don't think she mathematically realized she did that but this whole thing was just awkward.\" And he said \"I'm sorry.\" And I said \"okay\" and walked out. I cannot believe, despite our mistake of under tipping, that a server would ever, ever approach a customer about gratuity. Oh, and just a side note, after we went to our cars, my girlfriend who tallied our bill went back by and left more money with the bartender for the server with a note for him saying she was sorry.

We decided to take a chance on this place. Big mistake. I'm from Chicago and in Chicago you are not allowed to smoke in a bar or restaurant. This law apparently is not implemented in Nashville. We wound up changing tables in an attempt to move away from the smokers. The tables and chairs don't seem to be ever cleaned either. I think they are cleaned maybe once a day before the bar closes or so I hope. And the bathrooms were gross. I was afraid to touch anything and if I didn't really have to pee, I would have opted to hold it. The tile on the bathroom floor was broken, the locks barely worked and the toilets were let's just say, less then sanitary.After my adventure with the bathroom, I decided to try the food and hope it would be better than the above amenities. I ordered the Turkey sandwich with a side salad as I figured a sandwich is pretty hard to mess up. Wrong, again. My side salad arrived and I thought it was a joke. The salad looked like shredded ice berg lettuce, shredded cheese from a cheap taco, a jalape\u00f1o spread for a completely different dish and some type of bacon bites. My salad wasn't event served in a bowl! The vinaigrette salad dressing was the only thing resembling a salad on the plate. After eating aka picking through my salad, my main meal arrived. The turkey was so salted that no amount of salad dressing was able to cover up the taste. My boyfriend ordered the Two \"Texas Style\" hot dogs with red onions and chili. It looked more like carnival food to me. The chili was tasteless and the hot dog summed instant heartburn. The fries were pretty good though.The only positive about this place was the 2 for 1 beer specials.

Our waiter didn't seem to mind, either, so good on him. Speaking of the waiter, he was very prompt, courteous, and knowledgeable. Unfortunately I do not remember his name. After ordering the \"two for one\" beer (which, by the way, I figured was their way of saying 'half price'. No, they literally bring you two beers and charge you the price of one. No complaints here.) I asked our waiter what their specialty was. What do the locals come there to eat? He immediately responded that their brisket sandwiches are really good. So, on that suggestion I ordered one, and so did 6 out of 8 of us. It. Was. uh-freaking-mazing! I am originally from Texas and I now live in the \"dirty south\". I've had brisket a time or two. It is very easy to let it get dry and tough. Not this brisket. It had the texture and tenderness of a good thickly sliced corned beef yet retained the smokey \"earthen\"ness of a good smoked brisket. This, coupled with cheese and peppers and onions, on buttery Texas toast made for an unbelievable sandwich. Oh, and the beer! I ordered a Yazoo Hefeweizen because I saw that it was brewed in Nashville and I like trying local flavors and I've had hefeweizens before and know that I generally enjoy them.

I am FREAKED OUT! I came in 20 minutes before closing. Last week, I went into the other Local Taco by Eastland, 20 minutes before they closed as well and I had such a good experience there. They were very nice to me and I absolutely LOVED the food. Well, I'm pregnant and was really craving it again. So, I went to this local Taco and I am so disgusted! When I went in, I even said I was so sorry for coming in right before they closed, told one if of the employees that I was pregnant and really really wanted some Local Taco. I thought there was no problem. So, really happy and excited to eat some good food I'd thought about all week, I took my to-go order and went on my marry way. I took a bite and the chicken was really bad. It was so dry and the only thing I found enjoyable, was the breading from the chicken. It was chewy, very dry and I was SO disappointed! I couldn't believe how bad it was. So then, before I took a bite of the BBQ pork taco, it looked extremely disgusting. I couldn't believe what I was seeing! It did NOT look the same as the other local taco. The pork was SOAKED in BBQ sauce. Which was really spicy. There was liquidity stuff dripping all out of the tacos and soaking through them. It did not look normal to me at all!!!!! BBQ sauce is thick, NOT slimy and liquidity clear stuff coming out of it!!!!! WHAT WAS THAT!!!????? OMG!!!!! I was so flipping grossed out!!! I then seen something on the outside of the box that looked like someone wiped a big snot booger on the box!!!!!!!!!!! OMG I AM SOOOOO FREAKED OUT. I just got done puking 10 minutes ago from this. I was that grossed out. It did NOT look normal. Then, in the chicken tacos, there was something that was white and round which didn't even look like food!! It was definitely NOT cheese. Omg y'all! I am so freaked out and I feel so gross!!! God knows what they did to my food!!!! What do I do. They are closed now or I'd take it back up there. Now I am worried whatever I put in my body, might hurt my baby!!!!!! Omg!!!!! Please don't go here people! I can't believe this has happened to me ! I t understand! I paid $26 for 8 tacos! RIPPED OFF! The Local Taco on Eastland was fabulous. I can not believe the experience I had with this one. Wow! The guy at the bar who did not make my food that works there, was very nice to me. He talked with me while I waited on my food. I really liked this guy he was cool. So I don't Blane him. The cooks looked like a bunch of thugs! I do NOT want a thug making my food!

Each time I go I try and get something else to see if I might change my mind, since everyone I know thinks they are the greatest tacos, and I have yet to be convinced. While I don't expect traditional Tex-Mex as they are fusion tacos, I think they are overrated and either too much flavor or too little.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 1 review", "date": "2015-02-12"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nQueen B.\n", "review": "Great margaritas.good service.clean establishment.space enough between tables.indoor and outdoor seating.good locale.food: I wasn't impressed with my taco choices. \u00a0I got the Korean BBQ, and the special country fried chicken and gravy.Neither jumped out at me and made me happy. \u00a0Very little substance in the taco..

The Enchiladas however... the chicken enchilada was pretty \"meh,\" nothing really that stuck out, nothing terrible, but a 2-3 out of 10. The cheese enchilada was gross. Just a soggy tortilla tube of tasteless cheese. Nothing to write home about.I won't speak about my wife's meal except to say that we had similar thoughts, taco was sub-par from what you'd expect from a place called Local Taco, and she didn't care for the enchilada period.What I think this place has going for it is simple:1. It's cool.2. It's trendy.3. & the Margarita's are good.They should pair some of their coolness with some quality of their food. For me, it's convient and close, but not worth the money. Taco's and Enchiladas are easy guys, inject some serious quality into your food, and I'll be back weekly.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 14 reviews", "date": "2012-01-28"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nTodd S.\n", "review": "Two of us took a friend for his birthday last night.

Minus 1 Local Taco.* Speaking of the menu - Where is it? \u00a0I was handed a laminated menu that had been held by a hundred people before me and then everything goes South from there. (Let me tell you that it's tough to be a germaphobe.)* To be clear - these are not Tex Mex tacos, these are not Mexican tacos, and they are barely Cal tacos. \u00a0These are all contemporary American tacos. \u00a0Don't get off thinking that you're going to use the phrase \"Tex\", \"Mex\", or even \"Cal\" without getting slapped by someone from one of those places - and I wouldn't encourage you to call it Southwestern by any stretch.* What's with all the scrubby lookin' hippies that work at this place?

If you're going to make a Korean taco why not throw in a little cilantro to make things interesting? \u00a0Those wood stocks you call \"green onion\" did nothing for the lack of flavor, texture, and visual appeal but what do I know - I mean I used to live around the corner from \u00a0real Korean BBQ joint when I lived in Hawaii - This short rib wasn't even close.* When I ordered two tacos \u00a0with two sides \u00a0I got three tacos and one side (and the third free taco sucked more than the other two - \u00a0i mean who puts fried chicken, ranch dressing, lettuce, and tomato in a flour tortilla? (Oh ya, McDonald's does)* this place had a line to the door and the people just kept coming in.... \u00a0WTF??*Rice from a package? \u00a0come on! \u00a0You're charging me almost 3 bucks a taco and I get rice that tastes like Uncle Ben's Spanish rice with powdered chile on top (don't ask me why I know what Uncle Ben's Spanish rice tastes like)? \u00a0Not right man, \u00a0not right.* The parking is atrocious - but the Hippie folks at LT did the smart thing by offering valet parking. \u00a0YES, valet parking at a taco joint! \u00a0(\"Build it and they will come\" just came to mind for some reason)Listen, \u00a0don't get me wrong. \u00a0This 12 dollar meal wasn't all that bad. \u00a0The queso was the highlight of the meal for me (even though I never got the chips I'd requested). \u00a0And the Cuban corn was yummy - albeit a bit dry \u00a0and the fact that the place strives to use local ingredients is a big plus. \u00a0As I've said in another review if the masses think its good then it must be. \u00a0While I doubt I would ever step foot into Local Taco again I understand that the place is always busy - \u00a0My guess is people don't really come here for the food. \u00a0Understandable. \u00a0What they come for is not something I can easily answer, but the bottom line is that they do. \u00a0I hate to be so negative with my first review as an Elitest but hey, I gotta keep it real ya'll. \u00a0Local taco serves tacos and maybe dreams of some sort but \u00a0on my first and only visit I can't recommend anything except the queso (oh, and the valet parking. )", "location": "\nMt Juliet, TN\n", "exp": " 47 reviews", "date": "2012-12-01"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nGaby R.\n", "review": "I can't believe I haven't been here sooner.

Everything is a la carte and the portions are way too small for the price. They do have a lunch special with 2 tacos and a side which is a decent deal, but I personally find it to be insufficiently filling and need an additional taco and then a drink, so it basically ends up being 14-15 dollars at that point. I could get a much nicer meal than that at a much nicer restaurant. My boyfriend and I just had lunch there and it was seriously $30. FOR LUNCH! AT A TACO PLACE! We should have just gone to J. Alexander's or something and had a much nicer, larger and filling meal.The food is decent, some of their specials are especially good. The \"cowboy\" taco with beef and portobello mushrooms is probably the best I've ever had there, but it's only a special and not a menu item. I just find that the food isn't good enough nor plentiful enough to justify returning here.Most people seem to love this place and I just don't quite \"get\" it. I find the staff to be unfriendly, distant hipster types and FORGET getting a refill on anything or any other help. It can be crazy crowded in there and often the tables are not properly bused or cleaned. I've complained about their prices since the first time I went but usually got roped into going back with co-workers. After the absurd $30 lunch I will not be returning.Also, the final nail in the coffin as far as I'm concerned is that the chips and salsa are gross. The salsa just somehow managed to be flavorless and overly spicy, salsa from a jar is tastier. The chips don't taste very fresh and are just forgettable, I think a Mexican or Tex Mex place needs to excel in chips and salsa to be considered worth anything.

Either it's really interesting and tasty or boring and blah. We've been here twice - once for take out at dinner time and once for lunch. It's important to note that while it's called The Local Taco, these aren't really Tex-Mex or Mex style tacos, they're sort of \"high concept\" tacos, really more like low carb sandwiches - which I think contributes to the uneven flavor, since they haven't really perfected any one particular flavor. Pros:*The patio is really awesome - nicely shaded, good air flow, nice seating*Some of the tacos are incredibly tasty, especially the Korean BBQ, the local BBQ, the carnitas and the Southern chicken*They have a lunch basket that comes with 2 tacos & choice of a side (black beans, refried beans, or rice) for $6.50 - a reasonably filling & reasonably priced lunch*Definitely feels cleaner and less-likely-to-give-you-food-poisoning than SATCO and, despite the uneven food, was still overall better tasting than anything I've ever had at SATCO.Cons:*Some of the food is horribly bland. The black beans? I've made better from a can with a dash of salsa. The refried beans? Meh, again, tasted like from a can (but blander). The cheese dip? No spice at all. *While some of the tacos were especially tasty, some were just bad - in particular the shrimp (didn't taste like shrimp), the tequila chicken (didn't taste like anything), and the chorizo/potato (which had less texture than pureed baby food) *The parking is total crap. They have a tiny lot and they have a valet who takes up a few of those spots. It looks like it's possible to park in some of the lots across Murphy Road, but personally it's not a great road to cross on foot with the crazy busy traffic*Totally overhyped in the local media/blogs, so the place is really packed all the time & the wait times (especially for dinner) can be long*No free chips & salsa. With the prices that they're charging for tacos? There should be free chips & salsa.I think if they work on some of their flavor combos, add some spice to the beans and cheese dip, and can speed the ordering line up a bit, this can be a great place.

I was a bit nervous because I had heard mixed reviews, but I always like to try new things.Walking up to the screened-in patio, I was assaulted by smells that truly made my mouth water and my tummy grumble. I loved the relaxed shabby-chic vibe when we walked in, and while I could see how this place could get crowded during busy hours, there were still plenty of tables available to us. My husband got the taco lunch basket with one Korean BBQ taco and one Local BBQ taco. I got the lobster enchiladas (the daily special) and a cup of the tomato-corn soup. We placed our orders then went and claimed our tables and waited for our food to arrive.On first appearance, I completely saw what others meant when they said that the portions seem a tad on the skimpy side. I was particularly disappointed that my lobster enchiladaS actually wound up being a single enchilada that was pretty skinny (it looked more like a flauta). Based on how the dish had been described on the board (and that pesky \"S\" on the end), I expected to get at least two enchiladas for $5 or at the least, one rather fat one. That said, the enchilada was REALLY good - you could taste the lobster, and it was covered in this delightfully creamy sauce that had a nice citrus zing to it. And the cup of soup? I could have easily eaten a bowl, or a barrel, of it, because it was divine and I am not usually one to order soup. My husband's tacos were both quite good, nice and fresh tasting, though he would have liked it if the tortillas had been warmed. Additionally, he thought the salsa that accompanied his chips was weird, but I liked its smoky, vaguely Asian flavor and I can honestly say that I have never had another salsa like it.Our mains were so good that we decided to share an order of flan and \u00a0that was a great choice too. Nice and creamy with lots of flavor, and I appreciated that they tried to spruce up the plating to elevate the dish.All in all, I see how people might argue that the prices are a little steep here, but I have to say that the food was really tasty and I actually felt pleasantly full after I had finished my meal (even before the flan). I know this place often gets compared to Taco Mamacita, and I definitely prefer The Local Taco. It doesn't have that chain feel to it, perhaps because of its slightly smaller setting, and the food just tastes fresher and more inspired. I'd rather have slightly smaller portions of food that tastes really good than lots of something that's bland or heavy.

By the time we left around noon, it was quickly filling up... so get there early if you're going for lunch. We decided to sit outside on the wonderful covered patio, which I highly recommend if you happen to visit on a nice day. The food came out a little slower than I expected but the wait wasn't terrible. I got the tequila lime chicken taco, which was one of the better chicken tacos I have had. The chicken itself was very juicy and flavorful and topped with just the right amount of salsa verde and tomatoes. I will say that it could have used some lettuce or some other type of vegetable to round it out but overall I was satisfied with my order. The rice I got on the side was a bit dry and not too exciting. When I return, I will definitely try out one of the other side dishes. I will say that the tacos themselves are not very big or filling, so unless you are just looking for a snack to go along with your margarita I would definitely recommend ordering at least two tacos and probably some rice or beans.

The cashier was more focused on what was going on with the other employee & she kept having to ask \"what\" to us. Once we finally got our order in, we sat down at a booth. The booths are lined with a burlap type material that doesn't allow for you to slide into the booth & the pad of the booth is really close to the low table. It's an odd seating combination. A positive about Noodles is they have a coke freestyle machine. I might not be a coke can, but I love the different options available. It only took a few minutes for us to get our food. Both pasta dishes were hot (temperature wise) but the pot stickers we cold. Also, I've never seen pot stickers that are smashed so flat, almost like little quesadillas.

Most of my wife's favorite foods involve noodles in some way or another, so she was very excited about coming.I came in without preconceived notions, avoiding even reading Yelp before my visit. Visiting on a Sunday around 2:00 pm, my wife and I were both thoroughly underwhelmed by our experience.First, the service had issues. I was ignored by the counter person for a couple of minutes, although he may have assumed we were still making selections. I picked a table for my wife and I and then went to fill my drink at the fountain. While I was filling my drink, my feet were attacked by a carpet-sweeper wielding employee. I moved out of her way and she quickly jumped in front of me, between me and the table, and proceeded to take a very long time to figure out that a carpet sweeper doesn't work very well on a tile floor. I waited patiently for her to finish, which she finally did, after three minutes of me standing waiting for her to let me return to my table. She did not acknowledge my presence at any point during this exchange, even after she ran over my toes. I guess it was my bad for wearing flip-flops.The food was nearly as disappointing as the service. My wife's Mac and Cheese was, as Jason S. noted, no better than Kraft, and my Indonesian peanut saute with chicken was an exercise in bland laziness. As an example, the cilantro on top was an entire sprig, I had to pick the leaves off myself. We both had to thoroughly mix our dishes when they arrived at the table, the sauce was quite unevenly applied. The chicken and meatballs were both obviously cooked from frozen. The chicken had that hard, cracked leather outside and dry, chalk-like inside that comes from being unevenly cooked. Even our side Caesar salads were a disappointment. The cheese was some processed blend, not real Parmesan or whatever they claimed it to be. The romaine lettuce was mainly the tough, outer leaves and they were even wilted. It didn't help the salad was served on a plate still hot from the dishwasher.In short, I won't be back, and if you value your money and appreciate a good noodle dish, you won't bother going.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 230 reviews", "date": "2012-07-03"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nRachel G.\n", "review": "Can't beat the price, service, or taste.
