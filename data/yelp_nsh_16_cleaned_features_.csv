"500 Church StNashville, TN 37219",3.0,"I read many of the reviews on here about this location, but decided to try it anyway because I was near. That was a mistake I will not be repeating.Blue Coast is nothing more than a pricier Tex-Mex version of Subway.The business is clean and very uniform. All the workers are cordial and greet customers as they walk in. They are fast in mak---. Okay, I'm not going to lie, there is no ""making"" involved.

Therefore, the workers are very swift when it comes to assembling one's food which is where my dissatisfaction began.The ingredients looked  and tasted about the same, or worse, than what I've served at my home. All the vegetables, including the guacamole, tasted like they'd just bought them back from the grocery store and plopped them into serving pans. The gentlemen who were on the line left my tortilla steaming for so long that it became tacky; it felt like eating wet dough with canned chicken and vegetables stuffed inside!I pulled out the supposedly spicy chicken, and laid it to the side because it wasn't doing the burrito any favors. The chicken wasn't even spicy, just tomato-y. The rest of the meal went okay, until about an hour later when my stomach became upset.

This location downtown offers the same standards as the original (burritos, tacos, taco salads, etc.) with just as much consistency as the others. The taco trio is always a good bet--especially when you try a sampler (I usually go with the chipotle chicken, steak and a fish taco). The chipotle chicken is always tasty, but I find the steak a little middle-of-the-road. It's not bad, but it could have more flavor. The fish tacos are among my top choices with each visit, but my only compliant is that the tortillas seem to disintegrate before I have a chance to finish the taco.One of the pluses that Blue Coast has over the other Mexican-themed chains is their salsa selection. It reminds me of what they offer at Baja Fresh or Moe's, but with a lot more flavor. Their pineapple salsa is my favorite, but I enjoy the salsa verde just as much. They also have two kinds of traditional salsa (spicy and not-so-spicy) and a roasted tomato salsa. The chips/salsa/drink add-on for every combo is a must.This location is tucked away off 5th Avenue.

I like to give people the benefit of the doubt but the service last night had to be the epitome of ""we just don't care.""We walked in the bar side and there were some people who seemed to be having a good time. We walked up to the hostess stand and, even though there were many open tables, she asked us to wait while she prepared one for us. After she had ""cleaned"" the table, she sat us...next to a giant pile of spaghetti and meatballs on the floor from where a toddler had thrown it out of his high chair. When the waiter came, we asked to be reseated and he did so but must have thought that was the end of his night because he was completely inattentive for the rest of the evening. My fiancé claims to have seen him wiping his nose several times which, I guess, grossed him out.The food took forever even though we were almost the only people in the restaurant. When it did come, it was bland and over sauced. He ordered fettuccine alfredo and I had a Cesar salad with chicken. Even the chicken was gross. I feel bad the chicken died to be cooked that way. We had some chianti, which was good, but I couldn't help but notice the presence of fruit flies all around the restaurant. I don't know if this was because of the open bottles of wine sitting about or worse. I can forgive a fly in a restaurant with a patio but fruit flies are a different story.There seemed to be a lot of servers there who were not helping anything. I know servers have closing duties to do before they leave the restaurant and that's fine, but there just seemed to be way too many servers there to only have one person who didn't seem very good at his job getting all the tables.

"521 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",2.5,"Many years ago when the Macaroni Grill only had a handful of locations I held them in such high regard - As a matter of fact it was my favorite restaurant. I used to think that it was the coolest thing for the waiters to write their names upside down and then leave me a bunch of crayons to keep me occupied. I loved the fresh bread and the spicy olive oil and I had several first dates there - if I was lucky I had a second date there too. Alas, gone are the glory days of the old Macaroni Grill. I recently dined at this location and had a bad experience.  There were so many things wrong here I don't even know where or how to start so I'll just try to sum it up to get this over with. Amateur service you'd expect from a group of beginners included a server spilling a drink on the way to a different table, stopping to ask if the guest was ok, then proceeding to the original table, serving the food, then cracking fresh pepper (this was happening as a full glass of tea made its way to the floor and pooled while not a single server in the place made an effort to clean it or even apologize). Among the comedy of errors was a dirty table that remained uncleared for at least 30 minutes next to us, 4 different dirty wine glasses that were cycled through one table, one of our orders being wrong, no water refills during the entire time we there, and extremely slow service in general.The food used to be so good but it's become a standard corporate menu that is no better than the olive Garden and I hate to say it but I've had better pastas from the freezer section at Target. Stale bread and cheap olive oil seem to be the par here as we ordered my all time favorite the lobster ravioli which was a mess.  Not a single vegetable in this watery sauce that the waiter explained ""was the way they make it"".  Sad...Add insult to injury we were given the check without being asked if we wanted desert! Now, normally that wouldn't have mattered but we had a birthday in the group.  As we sat and stared at each other in dismay we thought it was best that we never got a chance to order desert or even look at the dessert menu. Maybe would could salvage the night and get a subpar dessert at the local grocery store.  True, we were that desperate.It's disappointing to see this place in such a low state because the Macaroni Grill was once stellar. As another reviewer stated we to felt cheated on the way out. Totally not worth the money we paid here. It's not the same Macaroni Grill it once was.The Macaroni Grill will be a business story about what not to do when you grow to an international company store.  Sigh...  Not happy that we paid over 80 bucks for a meal that I could have purchased at the grocery store for about 20 dollars....The only recommendation I can make here is to go across the mall to ClaimJumper or Chuys around the corner.",Romano’s Macaroni Grill,6155147700.0,47.0,2013-03-20,"Mt Juliet, TN",/biz/romanos-macaroni-grill-nashville-3,2.0,40,"Washington, DC",Johnny G.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.200055,-86.5186054,552.499286637459,False,2858.0,2.675,,2.675

At some point - records are lost - he and the dragon agreed to create a bread stove that emulated a wood-burning stove, but burned about 5 times hotter. The addition of dragon's breath to the baked bread created a concoction that was at the same time both delicious and mysterious.Sir Pizza and the dragon's creation - dragon-bread - took off as a hit all across Britain until King Constantine III exiled all dragon-wranglers throughout his kingdom. Thus, Sir Pizza found refuge in the city of Naples in the Byzantine Empire. There, Sir Pizza opened shop again and continued selling dragon-bread until his accidental choking death while trying to eat chocolate, strawberry and vanilla ice cream at the same time.The dragon itself died in 1127 and the Neopolitans were forced to find a way to make artificial dragon-bread, finally arriving on a tomato sauce/cheese concoction that looked and tasted virtually the same (but reportedly with less bite).The Neopolitans continued to make dragon-bread until 1390 when, during the Papal Schism, Pope Boniface IX ordered all references to dragons as real erased from all recorded history and ordered all tributes to dragons to cease. Thus, the Neopolitans were forced to come up with a new name for dragon-bread. While they considered calling it ""neopolitan-bread"", they decided instead to name it in honor of the bread's creator and thus it was called ""pizza"".This, of course, created a few more problems as ""pizza"" was at the time the name that strawberry, vanilla and chocolate ice cream had when they were in the same container. However, the neopolitans felt that since this name memorialized Sir Pizza's death, it would be appropriate to change the name of dragon-bread to ""pizza"" instead to celebrate Sir Pizza's life. In turn, they named the ice cream ""neopolitan"".Thus, from 1390 on, dragon-bread was known as pizza.Also, they have really good garlic bread here.",Sir Pizza,6153835726.0,72.0,2012-08-29,"Franklin, TN",/biz/sir-pizza-nashville-3,4.0,19,"Washington, DC",Patten F.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,35.1680139,-86.1084401,563.1786927308692,False,2557.0,3.736842105263158,,3.736842105263158

It very much reminds me of small roadside eateries I frequented during my travels in South America many years ago. Pretty good pedestrian fare (not a slam--just a statement of the style of food served.)I set up a farewell dinner here (at the request of a friend who is leaving the area). When I approached the owner about having a large group all at once, she looked startled that I'd even ask to reserve a place (for 21 people). But...not to worry...she simply said she'd close the restaurant just for our group on the specified date. Whoa! She said, ""what?"" Yes, she did.The food is all hand-made; the Pupusas are the best I've had in Nashville--filled with an appropriate amount of cheese, or mixto, or loroco and cheese (reminds me a little of mild green onions). Beautifully crafted and nicely toasted.--Fried fish - you get da whole 'ting. Ample portion and crisply fried.--Guatemala Tamal de Recado..meh. Good flavor but very, very wet, steamed and served in the traditional banana leaf.--Fried sweet plantains - average - a tiny bit greasy.--Doblada (a hand-made tortilla folded in half - resembling a large empanada - stuffed with potato & meat; big and mild flavored. (Add some house-made picante sauce.)--Carne Asada, big portion with rice & beans on the side; a bit chewy.--Soup, a very hearty bowl popular with locals, is available only on weekends. -----Half of the remaining items on the menu, including Horchata...not available on any given day. You take your chances. Uh...that's not a very good business practice. (Therefore, my guests had to pick and choose and ask about what they could have for dinner.) Hit and miss.--Soft drinks (bottled) no alcohol or other drinks.--Price...astoundingly inexpensive! Light dinner for 2 - ten bucks.--Atmosphere - 2 TVs tuned to Latin stations, showing fútbol. A large fan blowing across the cramped room and A/C that could barely cool the corner where it came up through the floor.--Attitude of staff - excellent, congenial. (Limited English, so it helps if you can speak Spanish).",Guatemala Restaurant,6157502717.0,143.0,2015-06-26,"Franklin, TN",/biz/guatemala-restaurant-nashville,3.0,7,"Washington, DC",Denny K.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,35.1680139,-86.1084401,563.1786927308692,False,2168.0,3.2857142857142856,,3.2857142857142856

"6410 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.0,"I've been on a mission to find decent Chinese food in Nashville. I'm not asking for anything exceptional at this point. I'm just tried of eating bad Chinese food. My mind is blown by the dismal choices in this city. Until now, Best Wok was my place of choice. It was meh, but better than most other places. This will probably be my new favorite. I would have given five stars if the soup had been better. Service was friendly. We were greeted by a young boy who was extremely cute and polite. He took our order and he was very professional. I liked him. We went with basics. sweet and sour chicken, General tso chicken, egg drop soup and an egg roll. The food came up quickly and we took it home. I like the containers, so that's a plus. I am a fan of the plastic ones I can reuse. Upon opening everything, it all looked very much like standard Chinese carry out food. I let out a sigh of relief. It looked and smelled good.The rice was cooked nicely, the chicken wasn't overly smothered in breading and everything tasted pretty good. The egg drop soup was way too thick. Too much gelatin. I know that can be preference, but I don't like it. I thinned it out with a package of soy sauce and that helped. I ate about half of the soup. The egg roll was interesting. It was really crispy and you could taste the greens in it well. It was a good egg roll. The fried rice was pretty good. It has carrots, peas, onions and egg in it. It's the really dark type of fried rice, which isn't my favorite, but my boyfriend liked it. I got the white rice and it was great. Perfectly steamed. You'd be shocked how many places I've been in Nashville that can't even get white rice right...So we had good service, fast turn around and decent food.

(We live 12 mins away from the restaurant)  Mind you this is not free delivery, so you're paying for slow service. If this is the speed on a weeknight, I would hate to imagine how long it takes on a weekend. 2) Egg rolls and other appetizers were cold by the time food arrived. Soup was lukewarm. Entrees were still fairly hot. 3) There were no utensils or chopsticks included in the bag. So the whole have a night off from cooking/dishes was thwarted by having to use our own silverware. Not a big deal, but still worth mentioning. If they're worried about waste, it's easy enough to ask the patron if they'd like utensils when they order.FOOD: 1) We had General Tso's Chicken, to try a hard to ruin Chinese staple. The breading on the chicken was great, light and crispy even with the sauce.  2) Mongolian Beef- this dish was just ok. We expected the sauce to be a bit thicker and more flavorful. The beef would have been better if it were slightly less well done.  3) The soup (hot and sour) egg rolls and crab wontons were all standard fare and exactly what we expected.

This is the one event I really wanted to be in for food wise so I RSVP'd early and was very happy when I received my confirmation. I went early with the gang but the doors opened pretty much on time at 3 p.m. So we headed in to get a good table close to the refreshments. Drink wise, we had some kind of iced tea and bourbon drink which is definitely good but not strong. Food wise, I was expecting some steaks bites and perhaps oysters but we got fried green tomatoes, deviled eggs, and mini biscuit steak sandwiches. Honestly, I've never seen any of these kinds of food before. Definitely never ever had a fried green tomato, never had a deviled egg that was so vinegary, and never had a steak sandwich with so little meat and a big bun.  No complaints because it was all free and all served with a smile. More than anything, I was happy to mingle with fellow Yelp elites from across the country.As promised, the event ended promptly at 4 pm and we were ushered out of the room back to the main bar because another group was going to use the room. Really too bad that Yelp did not secure in larger room for this event.

This was great, nonetheless. I initially thought it would be a good spot to transition to the next event, and this was open to anyone. With that being said, that is exactly how it went. There was no designated spot. The only way you knew any Yelp related activity was happening is because you saw a few people carrying those Yelp bags that we got during registration earlier that day.

No where, no how.Also, I hate to bring this up, but even worse, I hate that it even happened. As we were all around the bar WITH our Yelp bags, we had seen a group at the door.

"15560 Old Hickory BlvdNashville, TN 37211",3.0,"I had perhaps the worst dining experience of my life today at Las Palmas. I had been to Las Palmas once before and was underwhelmed. The service and food were fair to middling and the thing that stuck most in my mind was the nursing-home smell of whatever sort of disinfectant that they use to wipe down their tables. Fast forward to this afternoon.My wife and I entered a little after 3 pm. The restaurant was fairly slow; there were at most 5 tables seated upon our entry. It took several minutes for our waitress to come greet us and take our drink order. She walked up to the table and managed a surly ""what would you like to drink"" after I had smiled and asked how she was doing today. I received no response except an unamused look and a click of the pen as she waited to write down my drink order. No big deal, maybe she was just busy. When she returned with our drinks after another long wait, she spilled a fair amount of my margarita all over the table, paused long enough to shake the liquid off of her hand like a dog will shake after getting in water, and then walked off without a word. I was left to clean up the spilled margarita with the napkins provided with my silverware --napkins that were never replaced, even though I requested fresh ones twice. We sat for several more minutes before she returned to take our order. It was at this point I saw another server walk in the door and clock in. Then I realized what was happening: the shift change. The previous server obviously did not want to wait on us because she was getting ready to leave, hence the extremely slow service. The new server wasn't much better, but it wasn't her fault; the server who was leaving dumped all of her remaining tables on her and then the restaurant proceeded to get busy. At one point, I counted 8 tables that our server was attempting to wait on. Through it all, the other server on the floor, the hostess and the person I assumed to be the manager were oblivious to her struggle. My wife and I suffered with empty glasses for long periods.When we finally received our food, it was cold. I ordered the Palmas Fajitas and my wife ordered several a la carte selections. By the time our food arrived at our table, the cast iron skillet the fajitas are served on was not even lukewarm, much less sizzling; that's never a good sign. Since we had waited so long and were starving, we ate without complaint. Unfortunately we didn't see our server again for at least 15 minutes, long after I had finished my first three tortillas (yes, three is all they serve at a time). Rather than ask if we were enjoying our meal, she dropped the check and then said to pay when we were ready and she would bring me a box if I needed it. Incredulous, I asked if I might have a few more tortillas to finish my meal, as I had been waiting patiently for her to visit the table all this time. In short, even for Americanized Tex-Mex type cuisine, I cannot in good conscience suggest Las Palmas. It positively blows my mind that this place continues to be voted best Mexican restaurant in Nashville. The only way I can wrap my head around it is that it is the only Mexican restaurant in the area that is not in a sketchy strip mall or located in a ""bad"" neighborhood. Or perhaps, like Ese, they're remembering the Las Palmas of old. Or maybe Nashvillians are too scared to make the short trek to Nolensville Road to get some better food. Save yourself the angst and skip Las Palmas, there are far far better Mexican places within a five minute drive, and they're even less expensive and the servers are far more attentive.",Las Palmas Mexican Restaurant,6158310432.0,230.0,2012-06-10,"Nashville, TN",/biz/las-palmas-mexican-restaurant-nashville-2,1.0,40,"Washington, DC",Charles S.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.1622296,-86.774353,566.7091028370305,False,3599.0,2.8,,2.8

It gets an extra point for value for your money and friendliness of staff.I don't eat sushi (what kind of person willingly puts raw fish in their mouth anyway? .... shudder .....) so I got a chicken teriyaki bento box to go for lunch.

Here's the rundown: An iceberg lettuce salad with a homemade gingery asian dressing. cup of miso soup with seaweed. (I will be leaving that off any future order. I guess I'm not a miso soup fan either). three pieces of vegetarian california roll. large portion of white rice. large portion of teriyaki chicken.

Don't know what it was about it, but there was just this flavor that was unpalatable. I had to set it aside and find some leftover chili sauce in the fridge to dip the potstickers in. that wouldn't have been that big a deal, but the teriyaki chicken for all the rest of its deliciousness did have some of that weird soy sauce flavor. unfortunately soy sauce is in so many dishes, and I don't like theirs.

Even if I spent more we wold like it. We've always loved the sauce, they are generous with the cheese, and the toppings have always been good to great quality. The crust is hand-tossed (I have not ordered otherwise) and it's crispy and chewy without being greasy. We have rarely ordered otherwise, but their salads are large and fresh and good. Wings are a little ""meh"", but not bad.2) The price is great. I've always picked up the pizza. I have had delivery from this location once. It was fine. I get a large pizza with two or three toppings and it typically costs under $12. Great value. Especially because it's good.3) I have almost always received good service. I almost always carry out but have been treated with respect almost every time. I order from them near weekly, so I feel I have a reliable opinion on this. I read other reviews talking about them being rude and have never felt that way.Good, hot, fresh pizza that is reasonably priced and convenient to the area.

"204 Commerce StNashville, TN 37201",3.0,"After a day spent downtown at a festival surrounded by beer, wings, music, and a ton of folks, I closed my eyes and opened them at Brugada.* I was never one for checking out hookah bars. I was always under the impression that everyone passed the pipe around as is and if you know anything about me, you know that I don't do germs. But, life happens and I found myself at a hookah bar. When in Rome...So, thank goodness the REAL way to enjoy hookah is with your own personal mouth piece. Okay. I can do this. Well, I thought. I now know why Bill Clinton claims that he didn't inhale. Breathing in fire (willingly) is not a lot of fun. I know I am in the minority and people from all over enjoy smoking items of all sorts. For me, I'll keep my vices in liquid and food forms. It probably didn't help my case that I was smoking Blue Mist. If Breaking Bad taught us anything, it's that most things blue are made of crack... or, meth. And, they're probably not good for us.** So, smoking something called blue *anything* is probably not a good idea. And, judging by how out of control my new group was getting (oh, I didn't mention that I came here with strangers? Yeah. All day beer, wings, music, and more festival... bad decision jeans are all the rage), we probably made that point several times over.Since we were already smoking (not a sentence I use regularly), why not go all in with drinks and food? I kept things at 100 and ordered a Blue Brugada. What? I told you my bad decision jeans were on (and my butt looked good in them) and I was already smoking something blue. Why not go for the drink as well? Adding to the bad decision. It was $5. No good came from this... or, maybe, it was all good. I don't know. I have my kidneys. It's a win. Because things were spiraling, I went for the trifecta and went to town on the chicken nachos. I don't know whether they truly were the best thing I'd eaten that week or if I was well past the point of acceptable blue intake, but those nachos were damn good. And, at $10, a bargain for all the food you get with them. To finish things off, I demanded birthday cake from the (large) party who was celebrating. I may have danced with them as well. It's a blur. I blame the blue.But, I'd come back for more.*I'm pretty sure that's how things went.**That said, I will NEVER give up blue drink.

"5539 Edmondson PikeNashville, TN 37211",3.0,Poor quality and taste. Having lived in the Nipper's Corner area for more then a decade I have seen the area grow and begin to look more of an extension of Brentwood then of Antioch. With this shift new restaurants and stores continue to revitalize the area once home to a run down theater. Through this growth one thing has always bothered me: Why is Evergreen Express still in business? About once a year I fool myself into thinking maybe things are better but year after year they continue to disappoint me at Evergreen Express. My most recent experience was with both the Sesame Chicken and Kung Pao Chicken. Both where poor in regards to flavor and as quality goes neither order had a single piece of white meat. This has been my experience over the years. Each time trying a new item on the menu and each time wishing I had driven a few more miles to another spot. Their only saving grace is the egg rolls which are more of the Tai variety then the traditional ones you get at takeout places.

"96 White Bridge Road Suite 105Nashville, TN 37205",2.5,"Worst Panera I've ever been to!!! I'm a Panera Bread lover, so when I heard they were opening one right down the street from me I was pretty excited. Excitement has now turned to disappointment after the 2 god-awful experiences I have had there since it's opening! I went about 2 weeks ago through their drive-thru and I ordered a pick 2 with the Turkey Avocado BLT and a Chicken Caesar Salad (as is, nothing complicated). I wanted a baquett as my side and they said they were out of baquetts. You're Panera Bread, how are you out of bread!?!?!? I have never heard of such. So then I proceed to the window to get my order and the girl asks me again what I ordered. Apparently they had made me a Chicken Caesar Sandwich instead of salad. Why would I have a pick 2 with 2 different sandwiches!? That doesn't even make sense. So after waiting forever, they assure me they have included my salad and also gave me the Chicken Caesar Sandwich they accidentally made me. So I drive off but decide to check my order before I leave the parking lot and realize they didnt give me any dressing for my salad. So then I have to go back around and get in line again to get dressing. Finally I get home to eat my dinner, and I open up my salad to realize they put TURKEY on a CHICKEN Caesar Salad! I couldn't believe it. So then I figure I'll just eat the Chicken Caesar Sandwich they included instead. But I couldn't eat that either because the sandwich was DRENCHED in MAYO (which isn't even supposed to be on that sandwich) and the chicken on it was PINK!!! Wtf. Even my Turkey Avocado BLT was drenched in mayo, and it only had ONE strip of bacon on it. It looked like a disgusting mess! It was basically a $15 meal wasted! So I wasn't planning on going back, but today I remembered I had a free bagel on my Panera card that I've been needing to use. I decide to give this Panera another chance...surely they can't screw up a simple bagel order! Wrong. The lady I encountered at the window today could not figure out how to swipe a Panera card! She got extremely rude the moment I handed her my card and told her I had a free bagel offer I'd like to use. She immediately got flustered and started yelling repeatedly that my card was ""not processing."" A minute later she hands me back my cards and food and says, ""Sorry about that,"" so I assume she figured out what the problem was, but then I look at my receipt and see that I still got charged for the bagel. So then I said, ""It doesn't look like it took off the bagel?"" And she gets real nasty and says, ""Yeah I told you your card could not be processed!"" This is all quite odd, seeing as how I go to other Panera breads all the time and have NEVER had any issue with my Panera card. Sounds like user error to me. Oh and I got home to realize they gave me the wrong cream cheese with my bagel LOL. Why am I not surprised.Basically to sum it all up, I will not be going back to this Panera, and I recommend you do the same if you would like to save yourself the annoyance and hassle of getting a simple meal. You'd think sandwich making isn't rocket science, but these people need at least a year to figure it out.

I'm a sucker for Korean and Korean fusion foods. The parking lot here is pretty small; there were people parked on the grassy areas, and I happened to find a parallel parking spot on the side street. Located next to a dry cleaners, Soy Teriyaki is pretty small, but it surprisingly has a fair amount of seating. Like myself, most people in the lunch crowd are office workers in the area. I was planning on ordering some Korean tacos, but after seeing bibimbap on the specials board, I knew I wanted that because it had more vegetables in it. I placed my order and received my number. Then I got myself a drink, and as soon as I sat down, the bibimbap was brought to my table. Wow! Fast service! Especially helpful for the rushing lunch crowd. The presentation was nice, and it looked like there was a nice balance of all food elements in the bowl (veggies, rice, meat, etc). One of my biggest pet peeves with bibimbap is when it is served with too much rice and not enough meat or veggies. Many places often skimp on the meat, but this bowl had a good amount of everything. Instead of serving the gochujang on the side, they put it on top, but after mixing everything together, I found it was the perfect amount of sauce.

The food at Soy Teriyaki is always excellently prepared.  The food finely juxtaposes Korean and American tastes into a seamless culinary experience. The menu is light and nutritious as even the fried dishes are neither excessively greasy nor salty. It is easy for one's palate to appreciate the contribution of each ingredient.

"5008 Maryland WayBrentwood, TN 37027",4.5,"Thank the Yelpa for Yelp.My dad and I make a habit out of doing a weekly dinner outing and we like to try new places every now and then between regular visits to our favorite local haunts (though we don't haunt, we're not THAT rude).I turned to my fabulous friend YELP and came across this delightful restaurant! It was close, it was rated well, and it sounded DELICIOUS, so what did we do? WE WENT, OF COURSE.It's a small place tucked back in the hills of Brentwood (right next to a Dry Cleaner), but it has a simple, charming atmosphere. Nothing frivolous, just sleek and clean. The menu lines the wall as you walk up to place your order--I'd recommend getting the Chicken and Beef plate! It's DELICIOUS and it lets you try two things for $1 more (I think). The menu is limited, but what they do make, they make extremely well!If you happen to come in with a friend, I'd also recommend getting an order of their Gyoza, it is SO. DELICIOUS. OH. MY. GOSH. And make sure to use that dipping sauce that comes with it, holy heavens just thinking about it makes me want some. *Commence drooling* I greatly prefer this gyoza to Peter's.The chicken and beef are cooked well (also better than Peter's in my opinion); juicy, tender, and the teriyaki sauce drizzled over them is so delicious. So so SOOOO delicious. It kind of makes the plate, but along with that plate comes some broccoli and carrot slices, and some sliced vegetable, though I can't remember what it is at the moment...ANYWAY, onward and downward to my stomach. You also get a generous portion of steamed rice, which is perfect for practicing your chopstick skills.The staff is always friendly and accomodating and I'm fairly certain that I've seen most of the owner's family coming through here to eat. If I had a relative with a restaurant that made food like this, I'd probably be hitting that place up all the time too.

I'm not ready to crown it best Asian or Korean place around but it certainly is the best Asian fusion in town and my favorite place to eat in Brentwood.Bim Bi Bap is the most praised item here and that is rightfully so since it's awesome. For $10 you get a rather large bowl of pickled vegetables, rice, chili paste, marinated beef, and a fried egg. It's absolutely delicious and if you eat the whole thing you'll be pretty stuffed. The only downer is that it's only available on Thursdays.

I think it was finely chopped, marinated carrots on top of a few leaves of iceberg. But the dressing seemed to be missing. I didn't feel the need to return it, as I really am not much of salad person. I just eat it sometimes as medicine.I was hoping for the salmon teriyaki, but when I asked, I found out they remove the skin. I love salmon skin (which I know some people are weirded out about eating). I consider my salmon incomplete if it's not available.Instead, I had the ""chicken taco"" -- taco in the sense of a soft tortilla, rather than the crunchy, folded up kind. In contrast to the salad, the flavors were bursting. The chicken was not entirely seasoned, but the toppings definitely were. I detected a mixture of julienned daikon and apples with lots of kimchi-like seasoning. Not too much a fan of daikon. Had half of the daikon portions, and all of the apple part of the topping.",Soy Teriyaki Bistro,6153711933.0,534.0,2013-05-20,"Loma Linda, CA",/biz/soy-teriyaki-bistro-brentwood,4.0,194,"Washington, DC",Ruiqiu K.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,34.075631,-117.24995990000002,2245.288203627281,False,1382.0,4.618556701030927,,4.618556701030927

"5008 Maryland WayBrentwood, TN 37027",4.5,"Being a native of this little bubble called, Southern California, I've had just about everything around here to eat. The furthest I've ventured outside of SoCal was Vegas, which isn't much different whether you're sober or not. I'm not a critic, nor am I a pro at reviewing food. One thing I am good at, is eating. A ""foodie"" for sure. My fiancée and I get word about places to go and things to do, by word of mouth. Obviously, we look to Yelp for reviews and such for local spots. But how can I express or share a place that's over 1200+ miles away??Yep. Brentwood, Tennessee. Typically, you associate foods to the genre of the location. I was obviously expecting some good home country cookin', but I didn't. Don't get me wrong, Cracker Barrel lived up to to everything country, but this place.. Oh man. We traveled quite a long way and we were hoping to just grab some good southern food. But when we were brought to Soy Teriyaki Bistro, we were kind of shocked. Asian bistro? In Tennessee? We flew all the way out here for.. Korean Taco's?? WTH?! I came with the mentality that the food trucks, restaurants and cafe's in SoCal were just the GOAT.  Well, I will happily admit I was wrong. The bubble popped. Simple comparison, KogiBBQ truck is just the king of all that is Korean Tacos. The short rib beef tacos are top notch, with the assortment of toppings that make for a flavorful bite. No doubt, my go-to for late night cravings. Soy Bistro's beef tacos are just ridiculously the same if not, better than my local favorite. The first two impressions after biting into the taco? The fresh tasting, real corn tortilla at the bottom and the wasabi mayo, fresh crispy kim chi, and a spicy kick on top. The marinated beef in the middle sucker punched my mouth, while I was smiling over the first two impressions. The chicken was just as awesome, but I preferred a second helping of the beef. I could've easily hoarded a half dozen more of these affordable beef tacos, but the simplicity of each hand made taco made me appreciate just having two. The owners and staff are genuine and friendly. They appreciated our business and positive comments. Soy Bistro is an active part of the community. My observation of the customers there are very active with the owners. Warm and friendly environment inside the the place. Very active in the local community with events and good natured promotion of the goings on. We were only there for one brief afternoon and didn't get much of a chance to soak in the culture, but I only know because I follow them on twitter and by the looks of it, they have the recipe for a successful business. #STRONGWORK",Soy Teriyaki Bistro,6153711933.0,4.0,2012-06-06,"Orange, CA",/biz/soy-teriyaki-bistro-brentwood,5.0,194,"Washington, DC",Ho D.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,33.750037799999994,-117.87049309999999,2286.5699482847813,False,2644.0,4.618556701030927,,4.618556701030927

"5008 Maryland WayBrentwood, TN 37027",4.5,"My friends back  home in southern California have been raving about a new Asian fusion food item in Los Angeles that has become relatively popular within the last 2 years: Korean tacos. Whenever I fly back home to California on holidays, I usually stop by my favorite restaurants, rarely willing to try something new when I only have a few days to eat.I took the opportunity to try Korean tacos here at Soy Teriyaki Bistro and was pleasantly surprised. If you're looking for authentic Korean or any other particular Asian cuisine here, you will be disappointed. But if you keep an open mind and would like to try a fusion item, you may be pleasantly surprised as I was. I'm generally not a fan of fusion items--most Asian fusion restaurants sacrifice the best qualities of an ethnic cuisine (cough PF Changs cough). However Soy Teriyaki Bistro does the exact opposite and managed to pull it off quite well.We ordered a chicken taco, beef taco, and hawaiian bowl (fried rice with spam) + additional chicken. All three items taste nothing like I've ever eaten before, so it was quite a [refreshing] surprise to eat something so new yet so yummy. The meats are covered in teriyaki sauce, along with some veggies, a house ranch sauce, and pickled vegetables, all wrapped in a corn tortilla. I was surprised that the corn tortilla was not dry and 'crumbly' like most corn tortillas out there. Unlike most Asian fusion locations, the teriyaki sauce isn't too sweet.The hawaiian bowl did not need any additional meat items--the spam was enough meat even for a carnivore like me. The fried rice was a LITTLE greasy in the plate but it didn't taste greasy at all.Their website has all of their menu items and current prices. Don't come to the restaurant expecting to get your socks knocked off. Instead, come here and expect an interesting twist to your ordinary tacos with a little Asian fusion [that's done relatively well].I'll update this review once I try the Korean tacos in Los Angeles and see how they compare. ;-)",Soy Teriyaki Bistro,6153711933.0,116.0,2011-07-09,"Houston, TX",/biz/soy-teriyaki-bistro-brentwood,5.0,194,"Washington, DC",Tin N.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,29.7589382,-95.36769740000001,1219.3378323833313,False,2014.0,4.618556701030927,,4.618556701030927

"5008 Maryland WayBrentwood, TN 37027",4.5,"There are a lot of restaurants that cook up some delicious grub but shaft you on customer service. They know their product is good, so they don't have to make the effort to be nice to you. Soy Teriyaki Bistro puts all those other places to shame because not only is the food here stellar but this place is run by some of the nicest people you'll ever meet.STB is an unassuming place that is easy to miss, and from the outside it doesn't look like it's going to have much character; it's not fancy but it's not hole in the wall, so you'd be forgiven for assuming that you're going to get a pretty sanitized eating experience. You'd also wrong. Yes, the menu has salads and teriyaki combos, but if you're smart, you'll order yourself 2 or 3 of the Korean tacos. Having pledged my allegiance to the authentic taqueria tacos that generally only cost $1.25, I was skeptical at handing over $5 for two tacos. One bite and I was convinced: taste trumps authenticity, and these are the best tacos I've ever had. The chicken is very spicy and will make your mouth zing, while the beef is unctuous and has an addictive wasabi sauce on it. Normally I don't care for kimchee, but the STB tacos are laden with the stuff and I'm all too happy to get down and dirty to make sure I don't miss a single bite. Also, I normally order about 4 Mexican street-style tacos in order to feel full, but 2 STB tacos get the job done, so the price definitely seems reasonable to me. My hubby and I have also tried the spicy rice bowl and the Hawaiian rice bowl... yes it comes with pineapple and spam, and yes it is delicious! But be warned: you will have leftovers because the portions are huge!The tacos at STB are seriously crave-worthy. Don't be surprised to find your eyes glazing over a few days later as you think lovingly of your meal here and begin deliberately plotting your next return, I've experienced that enough to know it's totally normal. Best of all, the people working here are so friendly that you'll feel good about giving them your money. The man working the register seems to recognize most people (suggesting this place has a lot of regulars) and is really warm, welcoming, and just plain fun. Just to put things in perspective, on our last visit, my husband went to get some extra sauce and the chef addressed him *by name* and asked him how the food was... and we've only been there twice! When was the last time that happened to you when dining out? We were already believers but that attention to detail sealed the deal: the next time I'm jonesing for  Korean, you'll find me at STB! And the funny thing is, ever since discovering this place, I've been craving Korean a whole lot more.

When we walked in and found a table there were several that were dirty the waiter cleared off a table for us to sit down then proceeded to let us know that everyone else had left and he was the only one working. He picked up a pad to take our order but never gave us the menus luckily because we eat at Waffle House frequently we knew what we wanted When our orders came out my husband was missing his bacon I asked for my hash browns to be in a ring and they were scattered his waffle looked jumbled up as if someone had scraped it off the waffle iron his eggs were over hard instead of over medium my toes look like bread with a hunk of butter on it as if it had not been cooked. The waiter proceeded to take the plates back so they can fix it as they stood in front of the grill and whisper to one another our waiter left the room and went to the back while the rest of the crew attempted to fix our order I was very nervous because I watch them look over at us and whisper I was concerned that the manager appeared upset that she had to refix our orders. So the orders came back out and my husbands order was still incorrect so we asked to speak to the manager. Our waiter went and got her she walked over with a scowl on her face and my husband pointed to the food and asked her would you eat this food looking like this and her response nastily was yes I would eat it just like that because I cooked it. , so we proceeded to tell her all the things that were wrong with our order and she blamed the waiter and said we cook the food the way it was written on the order that's his fault what kind of manager doesn't take ownership for a problem and blames her waiter. So my husband was cutting into the waffle and he made a statement I won't pay for food that is not the way I ordered it and in that moment she reaches over to grab the plate out of his hand and says well you need to go somewhere else and eat you won't be eating this food and tries to grab the plate out of his hand!!!

My husband and I were off on the same day. As I have stated in a previous review, this is a rarity. It was a Tuesday, because that's when the 12South farmer's market was. My husband had just happened to scroll through his Twitter feed and see that Riff's was there (we both had been at work on the Battle of the Food Trucks day and really wanted to try this one).

Now I can't remember what it was...if one of you out there happens to know, feel free to chime in on this review. All I know is that it was absolutely delicious.

Just the right amount of mayo on top, but could've used a little more BBQ sauce.  No bonito flakes on it, but the chef let me know this was just a fluke that night.3. Banh Mi Flatbread - I spoke to the chef about what a misnomer this is, but once you get past the name (and the expectation), the dish is quite nice. The shaved pork has good flavor that blends well with the pickled veggies, chutney, and the coconut flatbread.  Good flavor, nice balance, crisp and light!",Riffs Fine Street Food,6156698782.0,18.0,2013-08-02,"Nashville, TN",/biz/riffs-fine-street-food-nashville,4.0,28,"Washington, DC",Truc L.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,36.1622296,-86.774353,566.7091028370305,False,1674.0,4.142857142857143,4.0,4.148148148148148
"Nashville, TN 37219",4.0,"I'm beginning to have my doubts about food trucks in general here in Nashville. Believe me, I love the idea. However, nearly every one I've patronized has been over priced, you wait forever for the food and when you finally get your food it's kinda mediocre. Such was the case yesterday with Riff's at Centennial Park. We got to the park later in the day. The only thing on the menu was burritos and tacos. Reading other reviews, I know you do others things besides tacos. I went for the fish tacos. I didn't want the pineapple salsa so I asked if they had any hot sauce. Puzzled at my request, the woman who took my order said they could put jerk sauce on the fish, which sounded great to me. So seven bucks for two tacos. During the nearly 30 minute wait I watched burritos being made. I saw plentiful helpings of chicken and brisket, rice and beans (mostly rice), gobs of pineapple salsa and some type of greens going into the burritos. At this point I'm thinking wow, if the burritos look as good, my taco should be great. Again, almost 30 minutes later, which is WAY TOO LONG to wait, my name is called and the guy hands me my tacos and says, ''Sorry for the wait (which was the standard line for everyone when they came up for their food). I made three orders of these before I remembered not to put the pineapple salsa on it"". I said, ""no problem' but, what I really meant was, 'what the hell took so long, it's just a couple of tacos?"". I start to walk away and look down at what I just waited a half and hour and seven buck for and it's just tortillas and two pieces of fish with this sweet jerk sauce on it. That's it! No garnishment what so ever! No slice of lime. Nothing! Seven bucks and a half hour of standing around in the hot sun for this?!? No, I didn't go back and complain. I was tired of waiting as were my wife and kids.C'mon, Riff's! You want to know how to make great tacos? Quit with the gourmet angle and go visit some taco trucks on Nolensville or Murfreesboro Roads. It's quite simple. You take two small corm tortillas, put a couple choices of meat on it, then cilantro and onions, a couple slices of lime and your done. Offer some hot sauce at the point the customer picks up the order. The same advice goes for Mas Taco. Quit trying to re-invent the taco. Oh, and charge half the price. You'd still be charging more than most real taco carts.

"Nashville, TN",4.5,"How possibly could food this good come from a truck I ask you?! We stopped by the Franklin Farmers Market on Saturday morning. It's been a while since I've been to the farmers market in Franklin, I was surprised with how many booths and people were there. Anyway, we made our way to Crepe A Diem. They were easy to spot because of the red truck AND the long line. If a food truck has a line, you know it's good. We skimmed the menu and decided on getting a couple things and sharing them. We decided on the Louisiana crepe, which consists of Andouille sausage, provolone cheese, caramelized onions, and red pepper - Rouille sauce ($8.50). We ordered the garden sausage sandwich, local pork, spices and fresh basil, scrambled farm egg, sharp cheddar cheese on a croissant ($8.50). We ordered both sides, hash brown, potato au-gratin with cheddar and chives ($3.99) and cheese grits, 'Beaver Dam Creek' local stone-ground grits with parmesan cheese and roasted tomato, garnished with sweet local basil ($4.99). And if that wasn't enough, we got the cinnamon and sugar crepe, Hatcher Dairy butter, cinnamon sugar, maple syrup ($4.50). You can tell they really work fast in that truck, it didn't take but ten minutes maybe for all the food to come out. I've always thought that most food trucks usually charge more than one would pay in a restaurant. This might be because of the convenience of it, but I think Crepe A Diem's prices are spot on. You get QUALITY food and it's not a little portion either. This garden sausage sandwich was a monster. I really loved the pork sausage inside, it was seasoned well and paired well with the cheese. Same goes for the Louisiana crepe. The sausage in that was so flavorful. I'm not a huge fan of red peppers or onions but loved this. The sides were great as well. This hash brown is probably one of the best I've ever had. I like this thing better than most places french fries. And the grits, can you say 'cheese'!?

There's a reason so many people are enamored with this bright red truck of French goodies. From what I've seen, the food truck market might have an edge on Nashville's brick & mortar scene wrt diversity. Maybe.What's not a 'maybe' is that CaD is serving up terrific food. I was hungry when I got to the truck so eating ASAP was on my agenda. I ran across their offerings at the 12 South Farmers Market and it just so happened that earlier I was chatting up the Hummus Chick (seriously. If you like hummus, find her; her product is tEh awesome™) and she told me that the truck was featuring her hummus in the Java Sandwich. Sold. I wanted to buy some tubs of the hummus, but I had many errands to run before heading home and it was a particularly warm early autumn day. I don't know if hummus spoils but I didn't want to take a chance. What I did want to do, though, was eat a sandwich with that hummus. So it came to pass that I stood in front of the CaD truck... and did not order a crepe.However, I didn't choose wrong. My vegetarian sandwich was a rocking journey of flavor and newness. For all those who think that food truck cuisine is greasy, simple and pedestrian, I challenge you to eat from CaD and keep that mindset. I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich and the fact that it took a little bit (not long, just not instant) to prepare. It made me feel as though my order was special and made just for me. CaD has a seasonal menu so I'm guessing my Java is a thing of the past but I have enough trust in the brains behind the butter that the current savory and sweet creations are just as fantastic.

The wine was good as was the meatball, but I have to say the meatball did not come close to what we expect from Moto. The salumi and cheese left a lot to be desired as I have had much better at lesser restaurants like Urban Grub, Saffire, and Adele's.

She was describing the chicken fingers, and I am now going to have to make a trip back to try them. She also was describing some of the other items, and I have to say that if they are as good as the burger I will come back every time I am in Nashville.The service was really good. As I said earlier, the downstairs bartenders were very attentive. There just was no available seating downstairs. As a result, we were about to leave the place when the bouncer let us know there was seating upstairs. Vanessa was the bartender upstairs, and she was a very good bartender. She's definitely the triple threat. It was nice because between Vanessa and Rosie the Riveter, it seemed like this is where I would be watching football games every Sunday (besides Bears vs. Titans/Packers/Vikings). One of the guys that worked there took a break upstairs by the bar, and he was telling me more about moonshine. I have to admit that I do not know about moonshine, but after talking with him and Vanessa... I might just try some one of these days.This place was really good, and I look forward to my next visit.",Swingin’ Doors Saloon,6157365050.0,24.0,2013-07-06,"Naperville, IL",/biz/swingin-doors-saloon-nashville,5.0,21,"Washington, DC",Mike C.,38.8949549,-77.0366456,41.772910700000004,-88.147867,618.8364534834958,False,2258.0,3.380952380952381,,3.380952380952381

That's when I remembered some coworkers mentioning Stax and that they had some decent burgers.

In front of you mounted on a wall , are your options of items to choose from. You get a little order sheet and a pencil to choose your options. Your choice's of bread (your basic variety), meat choices of chicken,turkey, meat and veggie (with them coming with two patty's per burger) A choice between a selection of cheeses and sides such as tomato's, onions and so forth. You can choose different meal options with some coming with a choice of sides being onion rings or Fry's. I chose a burger with Swiss cheese ( protein style) with onion rings ( I know) lol They also serve shakes with your basic flavors, as well as a small selection of beer and wine. My total came close to $13.00 and some change.It took about 10 minutes to get my food. It was presented deliciously appealing and piled high with a generous amount of onion rings.Everything (to me ) tasted lip smack-en fantastic! Quality of meat was there and the flavor was rock-en! The onion rings (with only the few I had) were restaurant quality which I honestly could have probably ate just alone. One minus however, was the annoying containers they came in that made it awkward to eat, they really need to have some normal plate alternatives.Overall, this is probably the best food joint for your buck here at Opryland with them delivering some pretty decent burgers and not lacking in portion of quality.

It was translucent and just tasted weird... The chicken satay was so-so. The chicken was much better quality than the chicken that was used in the coconut soup, but it wasn't incredibly impressive and the peanut sauce was so-so too.

I can't think of a polite way to put this, but it literally smelled like poop. It was disgusting. My husband took a few bites but couldn't stomach it. The smell was unbearable, and the beef was almost raw. I had to ask the server to take it off the table before I could begin to eat my food. The Chicken Sanibel made up for it though. Oh, it was sooooo good. I ate a bunch of it off my husband's plate. The chicken was cooked perfectly and so tender.

If not, go to Tokyo or Kyoto (or head into Nashville or Franklin if you want even better sushi).Long answer:I normally go to either Kyoto or Tokyo when I go get sushi to go in Bellevue. After seeing the reviews on best sushi in Bellevue, I decided to give Lemongrass a try. It is certainly not the best sushi in Bellevue and I would question any review from someone who states this. Unless they were having a bad night for sushi (and also a bad night for Thai a few months ago when I visited).My feelings on the sushi? It is marginal sushi, at best. If this is what people call the best, then they must think supermarket sushi is average. Perhaps I have just become too much of a sushi snob?The fish was fresh. The tuna was the worst of the bunch, as it was getting marginal. The salmon was very nice, as was the rest of the fish. The problem, however, is the rice. Rice is extremely important for good sushi and the rice here is most likely done far ahead of time. It was also cold, which is not a good sign. If the rice is refrigerated, it certainly is not fresh.I was fine with the sashimi that came with the meal, but with Tokyo only a few dollars more for an equivalent meal, I will not try again.

No vegetables, no herbs, nothing. Which might not be a problem if the broth was delicious, but it wasn't! It almost tasted like it had come from some sort of paste; like a soup starter. I threw it out! The spring rolls were great. I don't think you can actually mess up a spring roll... The Bangkok rolls were good too (like a chicken egg roll), but at $6, I'd pass because they aren't that good. For an entree' I ordered pad thai and also some pork lo mein for my mom.

They brought me the wrong food, which is fine, that happens, no problem. My sister began eating hers and the noodles were glistening with grease and cooked to the point of being mushy. Her sauce had very little flavor, almost like it was watered down, and the cook was too stingy with the spices, but she didn't send it back, she was nice and simply asked for some rice to eat with it so she could avoid the noodles. After 20 minutes, my order arrived and the chicken was almost raw. When I bit into it, my jaw literally bounced back open it was so undercooked.  I told the stern guy about it, and he actually  said ""You cannot keep sending back plates of food!"" WE HAD NOT SENT ANYTHING BACK. My sister had merely asked for some rice, kept her plate and tried to make do!
