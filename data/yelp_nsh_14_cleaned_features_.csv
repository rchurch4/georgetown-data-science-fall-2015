"2020 W EndNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"3.5 starsSo my friends and I were starving on a late Friday night and we were trying to decide where to go to feed the hunger. We wanted something unhealthy, potentially greasy, and something that would satisfy this emptiness in our stomach. And all at once, we agreed, ""FIVE GUYS"".I ordered a Little Cheeseburger. But, don't be deceived by the title, the Little Burgers would be more than enough to fill you up--the difference between the Regular and the Little is just an extra meat patty. And I enjoy a little more balanced meat to vegetable ratio in my burger anyway. After ordering, they give you a number and you can wait until your number is called.  In the mean time, while my stomach was about to implode upon itself, we helped ourselves to the complimentary peanuts. Yes, peanuts. Huge tubs of peanuts and bags of peanuts line the restaurant and you are welcome to take as many peanuts as you like. We each quickly devoured a basket of peanuts.After a few minutes, they called my number and my lovely cheeseburger came out. The patties are always juicy (slightly greasy) but yummy. What I love about Five Guys though are the plethora of topping options and the detail to which you can customize them. For someone as picky as me, I really appreciate being able to customize every topping that is placed on the burger without getting weird judgmental looks from the guy behind the register as I describe that I want a cheeseburger with ""only onions"" meaning no ketchup, no mustard, no mayo.  And I love being able to pile on grilled mushrooms and green peppers. Overall, great flavors, my only complaint was the sogginess of the burger.  By the time I opened my burger (in the restaurant, no less), my hamburger buns seemed limp and lifeless, barely holding together the burger itself. I really wish they toasted their buns or somehow solved this problem so that they would really stand up to all of the toppings they cram inside.Their fries are pretty good too. They remind me a lot of Boardwalk Fries. You can get them cajun style or normal style.  The cajun style kind has a cool paprika-filled seasoning sprinkled over the fries that reminds me of Old Bay seasoning. Also, like with the Little Burgers, a ""Regular Fries"" will more than fill you and your dining partner up. Use caution if you want to order a ""Large Fries"" because it really is a heck of a lot of fries.  Even after coming in so hungry, we couldn't finish off the Large Fries we ordered. Again, my only complaint with the fries, if I had to make one, is that they seemed a little limp and soggy. Or some of them did.Suffice it to say, we left Five Guys plenty full and I would definitely return again when the craving for a cheeseburger becomes unbearable.Another word of warning: greasy floors. One of my pet peeves.  Wear shoes with traction, lest you slip and fall. Also, free 2-hour restaurant parking behind the building. Although, you unfortunately cannot enter the restaurant from the back entrance for ""security reasons"". Which, by the way, we found out the hard way as one of my friends let in someone who wanted to come in from the back and was then publicly admonished over the loud speaker that the back door is locked for security purposes.

The reviews are great and all (I mean, who am I to say I don't like reviews!), but the food can speak for itself.Let's just put it out there that 5 Guys is a go-to greasy burger joint, which is great when you're craving it. And yes, I was craving it. Oh, it's so simple--a streamlined menu of little burgers, regular burgers, and ""other stuff"" along with your choice of toppings make the decision process a breeze. There are peanuts to gorge yourself with as you wait for your food that is cooked literally behind the cashier. Personally, I've always gone for the little burger/cheeseburger, but not because I don't have appetite--these burgers are BIG(ish). The regular ones aren't much bigger, but they do have another meat patty.In terms of burger joints, 5 Guys is great. I almost always inhale the food, so I'm pretty sure that I enjoy my experience every time...I like that I can still taste the potato part of the fries (both cajun and regular). When you order these thick-cut fries, they give it to you in a paper bag and they're so generous with their fries, you could feed two with the regular size fries and four with the larger size. Side note: They also have a cup in the bag of fries, which I imagine in reality they use to scoop up the fries, but I like believe it's their way of saying, ""Hey a normal portion would fit in this dinky cup, but because I like you I just put it all in the bag."" I like that I can have all the toppings I want on my burger, which for me is all of them. And, the food is quite fresh. The only problem is their bun, which really can't quite contain the explosion of goodness going on in between.

I don't know if it's because I'm a chick or because I'm obviously pregnant or because they're just really nice.I love that the burgers are made to order. They're always all misshapen and you can tell that they were hand-pattied. The ingredients taste nice and fresh - if you get a burger with mayo and tomato, for example, the beef is hot and the condiments are fresh and cold and crisp. That's one thing that I definitely miss when I have exactly two minutes to eat and am forced into FastFoodLand for a burger - they always taste like they were made an hour or two ago. Taking ingredients away to ensure a fresh patty doesn't ever seem to do the trick either!

I know that we Americans are all about MORE MORE MORE and FAT FAT FAT, but seriously, no one needs a minimum of two patties on a burger. And when you order fries, they're like $3 and they fill the freaking bag to the brim with them - jumping and leaping joyously out of their little cardboard container.

We ordered, my daughter and I, and received yummy sandwiches and chips delivered to our hotel room. It was a good meal and worth the price. A month later when I received my banking statement, I saw that the store had charged me for someone else's order too. I had two debits on my statement, two authorization numbers, and two amounts coming out of my checking account.

One being a 3 course option with your choice of any entree, appetizer and a choice of dessert for $50.00 ( not bad) and the 4th one was the same, just included with a glass of wine for like $65.00. We all chose the 3 course fro $50.00. Most of us got the fried calamari as an appetizer except for my boyfriend who got the caprese salad. For our main course choice, most of had a dish that I cannot recall the name though, it was lobster, clams and mussels over a creamy rossoto tossed in light tomato like broth.Our server in the beginning was prompt and our appetizer arrived within a reasonable amount of time, presented mouthwatering appealing and piled high with a generous amount of calamari. It turned out to be quite good, seasoned well and cooked perfectly though, nothing spectacular. I also had a bite of my bfs caprese and it tasted extremely fresh and flavorful.Our main coursed arrived a little bit longer than anticipated though when arrived, was presented beautifully! The lobster was much smaller than expected with most of the presentation being the shell. The clams and mussels were seasoned well, though still nothing spectacular especially considering the prices, I would have to say the best part of the meal was the creamy rossoto ( I usually try to steer clear of too much pasta, but the baby disappeared fast : ) . Everyone else enjoyed the main course for the most part, except for another cohort that got a clam like dish, that was pretty disappointed with it. Through out our dinner here, we were greeted and asked how everything was, from the extremely friendly lead chef there, which impressed us much.Finally for our dessert, they had a selection of mostly fruit based desserts that did not quite appeal to the most of us. Again, the chef came out again and we decided to ask him for his opinion of what to choose...man, was he in for something Lol like a red carpet we rolled out with over a 100 questions. Finally, he mentioned something he could make that was not currently on the menu and that would please all of us and it was....just just your typical Italian conoli desserts, yes.He said that it would take a bit longer to make being he would have to defrost the dough, though looking up at him like kids waiting for ice cream and not needing to be anywhere, we decided to wait.So we waited and waited. I am a big fan of desserts and will wait for good things however, this was just too long. Finally they arrived looking outstanding and decorated to an art! After biting in to it though, my first detection was it never defrosted completely and was cooked to for too long leaving my in hopes of not cracking my tooth. The filling though, was the only thing worthwhile breaking through the sacrifice and a matter a fact, it probably could have been award wining if the shell wasn't so tooth chipping hard. I really didn't want to say anything to the poor chef being he went out of his way, though I probably would have been better getting any other dessert.Overall, definitely mediocre Italian food that's overpriced because of the location.

"6802 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.5,"Red Robin was a favorite of mine growing up in So Cal, typically where we would go to gather for a Birthday or some sort of get together mainly because they offer so many different burgers! So I was excited when they expanded to Nashville, and at Nashville West to boot since I love this shopping center. I was a long time fan of the chicken burgers, have had almost every one on the menu each one is a hefty serving and delivios now that I am not a meat eater, I opt for the Gardenburger. Red Robin will put pretty much any topping on your burger you have available, so dressing it up is easy. Wait....I am forgetting the bottomless steak fries! Yes, you can have bottomless fries for your entire visit! Although a single basket is typically enough, we have on occasion ordered a basket as an appetizer and you aren't charged extra. They have their own seasoning salt at each table as well that adds a bit of kick to them and is just salty enough too. Recently they changed some items on the menu but the staples are there, and they now have wraps and salads. You can order any burger or sandwich lettuce wrapped, and have melon as a side (cantaloupe is one of my faves!). They also started offering sweet potato fries for an up-charge, I ordered them and my first batch was cold, but the waitress kindly brought me a hot fresh order. They were okay, but nothing I would order again, I will stick with the steak fries next visit. The kids meal menu is one of the best I have experienced while eating out, they actually have options and side items that include healthy salads, oranges, carrots and melon and each are reasonably priced including a drink. Overall if you are looking for a very family and pocket book friendly option for dinner, this is a great place. You not going to experience grass fed local beef, local artisan cheese and buns from the local bakery, this is a chain but its' still good eats.  I have always experienced excellent service at this location as well and will return again and again.",Red Robin Gourmet Burgers,6153521710.0,111.0,2012-03-01,"Nashville, TN",/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashville,4.0,52,"Nashville, TN",Jenn Z.,36.1622296,-86.774353,36.1622296,-86.774353,0.0,True,2014.0

"2804 Gallatin PikeNashville, TN 37216",4.0,"3.5I used to live in Chicago (8 years). I've eaten in Greektown many many times. I have no idea what a 'Chicago-Style Gyro' is.* So, on one chilly Thursday evening, I found myself speeding up & down Gallatin with burgers on my mind. Traffic frustrated my pole position ways and during my stop, I spied CSG. I'd seen it many times and thought 'tonight is as good as a time to try' than ever so... I stopped in.I walked in and there weren't many people in the dining room. This is good & bad. Good because this (usually) means that the wait time will be minimized. Bad because empty restaurants sometimes come with a reason. I committed to drinking copious amounts with booze with my food (to kill anything that might try and kill me) and kept it moving. I asked the guy behind the counter what made the gyro Chicago-style. He mentioned something about the bread that I didn't quite catch/follow and at the risk of having him explain it again, I just decided to order. I ordered a combo plate. This came with chicken, gyro meat, rice, tabouleh salad, and pita.Everything was solid, if not ground-breaking. The chicken was served with ranch dressing, which made me give a side-eye. For reals? Ranch? I mean, ranch dressing *is* deliciously addicting... but... for reals? Ranch dressing? In an ethnic establishment? The side-eye was warranted. Thankfully, the gyro came with tzatziki. The meat was a bit saltier than my usual taste but when paired with the rice & pita, more than edible. Tabouleh can be an afterthought and this tabouleh was right on par with that trend... but it wasn't bad tasting. By the time I was done eating, I was full, satisfied, not in debt, and no where closer to understanding what a Chicago-style gyro was than when I stopped in. I guess some things are meant to be mysteries.*I still don't.",Chicago Style Gyros,6156509797.0,1642.0,2015-10-09,"Nashville, TN",/biz/chicago-style-gyros-nashville,4.0,31,"Nashville, TN",Johnny T.,36.1622296,-86.774353,36.1622296,-86.774353,0.0,True,1816.0

I usually get the combo plate, which is a mix of gyro and chicken, taboulleh salad (they offer a side salad, but the taboulleh is fantastic), toasted pita, and dressing. The flavor and quality of the gyro is the best I've had anywhere in Nashville. They serve large slices, which is better than the dried out chippy pieces you often get at other places. The chicken is always fresh, tender and well seasoned. The only reason I gave them four stars is because of the rice.

"900 Rosa L Parks BlvdNashville, TN 37208",3.5,"One of the better BBQ options in Nashville, their pork has an awesome taste and texture. Plenty of residual collagen, so not too dry, but with an awesome bacon-smoke flavor. One of the few BBQ joints in Nashville that can stand without sauce, and indeed, I recommend going without it at least the first time. Love those corn muffins, too!I also commend them on adding a fryer after the flood renovations. I resent BBQ joints that try to avoid selling fries, because it generally suggests they are being too cheap to operate a fryer. The fries aren't a high point (really need to be thicker) but at placated my value sense. they really could stand to ditch the meat and three sides and go for something a bit more modern. Everybody does those same sides in Nashville, so it is hard to stand out, although they do experiment with the grits and egg rolls.They do tend to get a bit sluggish at lunchtime, due to popularity, and they could stand to have a bit more space or a more efficient layout. One person ordering something fried means an awkward standing customer in the narrow service area, for example.

Actually, I wasn't so tempted by the Super Deluxe's size as I was by its fixins: loved the mushrooms, loved the grilled onions and jalapenos, and while I was a bit worried that the BBQ sauce was going to drown out the burger, they were quite conscious of that potential catastrophe and put just enough on. Also, the bacon actually tasted like bacon, which  you'd think wouldn't be asking for much, but a lot of burger joints don't seem to understand this fundamental concept.In spite of the burger's awesomeness, though, what I am still thinking about the most are those seasoned fries.

"357 Clofton DrNashville, TN 37221",4.0,"My what a difference a little time makes. Was in the area with the kids and looked forward to another good trip to Pizza Perfect...Was sorely disappointed; Not only with the pizza (which was much worse than I remembered...the sauce was old, I think), but even more disappointed in the attitude of the people working there. It is purely amazing that managers and owners of businesses that deal with the public fail to instruct their employees on the absolute neccessity of good customer service in the age of immediate online reviews and social media. Astounding, really. So here's the deal:The Kids spent a little time in the game room where my 10 year old daughter put 1 quarter in a game that took 2. She wanted her money back and hit the coin return lever, but nothing happened. She came to the table to tell me and I told her to tell the young lady at the counter...I was trying to teach her a lesson about asking for what you want and was certain she would experience a good lesson in customer service when she got her quarter back. T'was not to be. The girl at the counter said that since she only put 1 quarter in a 2 quarter game she could not get her money back unless she put another quarter in and pressed the coin return (Keep in mind that this was an older game that just starts without giving you the option the get your money back...But I digress). No biggie, no problem, I thought, I'll just put the other quarter in and let her play the game. So I put another quarter in, and...wait for it...nothing happened. I hit the coin return lever (remember, old game), and...wait for it...nothing happened. So now back to the counter to get 50 cents. No biggie, no problem, I thought, they will just give me the 2 quarters and we'll be on our way. Not yet...Now I have to face the same girl at the counter who proceeds to say, ""Well, did anyone else play the game between the time your daughter put her quarter in and the time you did (maybe 30 seconds)? No I said, there is no one else in there (the restaurant was nearly empty...I wonder why? There I go again: Digressing.) ""I just need my 50 cents"", I said. Finally she grudgingly hands it over, with an attitude. I decided to give her a little construcvtive feedback, so I say, ""Hey, you probably should have just given her her quarter back in the first place. I would have been good customer service, you know."" ""Well"", she says, ""that's not our policy."" Really?! She pulled the old, ""not our policy"" over a cool 25 cents. Brilliant.""Ok"", I say, ""you have lost a customer as a result of your 'policy', be sure to let your manager know we won't be back."" I get the kids from the game room to leave and as we're leaving I notice the girl talking to a slightly older guy in a plain white tee behind the counter and he's looking at me like I just took a dump in the middle of his restaurant. Oh great, I think, a 20 year old night manager at a pizza joint on a Monday: The very definition of 'a big fish in a small pond'. I look at him and say, ""Great customer service you have here. We will not be back, and rest assured I will be writing some online reviews of how poorly we were treated in your establishment.""

"357 Clofton DrNashville, TN 37221",4.0,"Mell. F's review is not accurate, nor appropriate. I have never heard of anyone making a 16 year old girl cry over a quarter. Pizza Perfect has an upstanding and astonishing reputation for great customer service, and has always been fantastic with kids. I remember one time when my child was in the game room and got upset with another bratty kid. This kid tried to take her stuffed animal and one of the cashiers took it upon herself to come find us as parents and explain what she saw, and helped our little girl out. Tell me what place would do something like that? Tell me who would go out of their way to make sure our child, whom none of the employees knew on a personal basis, was safe and alright? Your child basically put one quarter into the machine and tried to get another quarter from the cashier but the cashier told your daughter it takes two quarters to activate the machine. So basically you got upset because the employee did not give your daughter an extra quarter to play the machine. That's childish and selfish of you to try to ask your kid to get a quarter out of a restaurant. Just give your kid a quarter it's not a big deal. You and your child are in the wrong and you are throwing an in inappropriate hissy fit if you ask me.You can ask all of the families in Nashville, who have been to Pizza Perfect, and I am 100% positive they will say the exact same thing I am.

"2800 Opryland DrNashville, TN 37214",2.5,Fuse sports bar is located in the Opryland hotel in Nashville Tennessee. If I remember correctly I have been here four times maybe more. Here's the deal it's the only place in the hotel out of the 15 restaurants that you can get alcohol and food after 10pm.  The catch is that they stop serving food at midnight and alcohol at 1am. This place is expensive. We ended up spending a lot I mean a lot of money in this place. They get you two Ways. The first way is they are located in the hotel so things are going to be more expensive. The second way is after 10 PM they're the only ones that have alcohol. The fuse bar and Grill in my opinion difficult to find if it's your first time staying at this hotel. I had to have an employee escort me to find the fuse bar.  This hotel is so massive. make sure that you have a map or ask somebody to bring you to this bar. The sign changes color constantly from green to red to blue and they have a bunch of TVs with every single game that you can imagine on with DirecTV. They do advertise this place has a nightclub. From the outside it does look like a club but once you get inside it just looks like modern bar. I did not see an area where there was a dance floor there was no live music or DJ playing. Fuse was reasonably full at lunch and from dinner to midnight the place was pretty packed. I did eat here two times for lunch in the food was good. I had a turkey club sandwich $18 that I could only half of.  The next day for lunch I had a chicken quesadilla appetizer that was a really good for $15. One of the nights here we got like six appetizers and I can't remember how many beers there was definitely more than 20 beers on the table at one point. I did notice when I ate here for launch that the staff seem to take forever to refill our drinks or to come back to the table. But the night when we had the six appetizers and all of the beers there was two people constantly coming to work table to remove drinks get us refills and we didn't have to ask anybody.  The one thing that I did enjoy here was their wings they did have pretty decent wings but there quesadilla was way better than the wings. If you were staying at the hotel just be prepared that it's going to be expensive and you're better off just going outside of the hotel to a sports bar. Overall I'm sure I will be back here next year the food was okay but very expensive the drinks were good and they had pretty much every sports game you could watch on television. The only downfall is they stop serving food at midnight and they stop serving alcohol at 1 AM. PROS:- full bar and good beer list-staff was nice CONS:- food is expensive for bar food - staff was slow for lunch - stops serving food at midnight. - not a nightclub,Fuse,6154583873.0,275.0,2015-03-10,"Manhattan, NY",/biz/fuse-nashville,3.0,78,"Nashville, TN",Josh M.,36.1622296,-86.774353,40.7902778,-73.9597222,763.6435628412805,False,2750.0

"2800 Opryland DrNashville, TN 37214",2.5,"After a couple visits during a conference at Gaylord Opryland Hotel, it's easy to say this is one of the better restaurant/bar options on-site. It's a sports bar with a full bar and a menu full of burgers, salads, wings, and appetizers. For lunch, it was a place to chill out for a conversation or watch sports on one of the many TVs. After dinner, it was a bar to crowd around and let the company pay for drinks.I tried the Three Alarm Fire Burger for lunch. The 1/3 lb. beef burger comes with Pepper Jack Cheese, Jalapenos, and Green Chili Sauce, but it was made even better by upgrading to the Dante's Inferno version which comes with Dante's Inferno sauce. The waitress was helpful and brought extra on the side for dipping. 4 stars for the burger, but only 2 stars for the ""Wrinkle"" Fries which were simply old fries.During a late night drinking binge I ordered sliders. The bartender asked if I wanted them Coney or Chicago. I said Coney which apparently means they are Hot Dog Sliders covered in Chili, Cheese, and Onions.

In a year (hopefully sooner), there will be more options for late(r) night quick eating Downtown but until there are, there's Caesar's. A staple of post-room service munchies at the local hotels, Caesar's has the pizza thing down to a science. On a Wednesday night that had me running from pillar to post, I needed food for the safety of all around me. Striking out nearly everywhere within a four-block radius, I went with Caesar's. A 10"" supreme pizza sounded just right. What did not sound just right were the fees associated with delivering it to my hotel. I saved nearly four dollars (not including the tip I'd had to give to the delivery guy) by hoofing it and picking it up myself. I understand that everyone has a bottom line and that businesses are in the practice of making money but when you've practically cornered the market, think of the future. When there are other choices around, brand familiarity might not be enough to keep you afloat.I picked the pie up, received a couple of grunts from the guys behind the counter, paid my money, and went off in to the night. The pizza was what you expected: cheesy, not-too-greasy, decently-adorned with pepperoni and the (standard) rest.

Unfortunately my first experience was too sub-par to draw me back.The Staff were very friendly and accommodating. It was not busy for Saturday night dinner and everything hit the table in good time. None of this matters if the food is lacking and that was the unfortunate case.I ordered a plate of enchiladas. I love spicy food and requested they be made extra spicy. I explained that I wasn't concerned with how the spice was added (add jalapenos, spicier sauce, etc) and when the server seemed to understand my request I explained, ""whatever the kitchen feels will make it spicy and taste the best."" I am confident there was no language barrier, which, to be honest can happen in a Mexican restaurant.What came out was bad. The tortillas were soggy and discolored, having been covered in a sauce that was absorbed by the tortillas and made mushy, like when you take leftovers home and re-heat them. Except they were cool. The chicken and steak inside were dry and bland. They had thrown some diced jalapeno into the mix inside, but just a little, providing no real spice and flavor. After attempting to choke them down for a moment I called the server over and asked for some hot salsa; not just for the heat but because they were so dry. She replied that the cook put jalapeno into them, but I explained it was not just for heat but also dryness. She brought back some spicier sauce and that was the end of it. Enchiladas are by definition something rolled in a corn tortilla and smothered in sauce. I really believe this was prepared well ahead of time with some war surgery attempted to make my more special order.Had it only been my meal, I may have been willing to pass this off as a bad first attempt at my ""special order"", but my son's child's meal was bad as well.

"222 5th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Rarely do I come home from a restaurant thinking, ""I must Yelp that place now"" - unfortunately my experience today at the Two Twenty Two Grill forced me to do so. Let me begin with a caveat - the rating is not about the food (which was tasty and quite good). It instead belongs to the service and the experience. My friend and I arrive for our brunch reservation and are promptly seated. Our server doesn't greet us with any warmth, but this is hardly a must, as long as the service is good (which it was not). She takes our drink orders and returns a few minutes later asking us if we're ready. This is where the service takes a nose dive. We waited forty minutes for our food, and considering only one other table had not been served, this is an atrocious wait time. While we were waiting, our server stopped by to refill my water once, but never asked if I wanted more coffee - and I had to flag her down to do so. Mind you, there are three servers covering seven active tables - at one point my friend joked that the staff outnumbered the customers. I understand if it's crowded or busy - but it was neither crowded nor busy. Our food comes, and it's outstanding. By the way, the Fried Chicken biscuit is simply delightful - moist fried chicken, eggs, cheese and gravy all come together nicely on a flaky and thick biscuit (not dry at all!). My companion asks for butter...literally five minutes go by before we flag another server who brings it to us in 15 seconds. We ask for the check and a box for my leftovers - the girl takes another 5 minutes. And she doesn't even bring the box! I had to ask another guy working there for it. We did leave a tip, but frankly she didn't deserve one. When I asked about the validated parking, the hostess had no clue and directed me to the front desk (shouldn't you know about this?). The front desk folks gave me a validation ticket, but when we got back to the Pinnacle garage on 3rd and Demonbreun, the validation ticket took $2 off. But it was supposed to give us parking FOR $2. On their own website it says,""Two Twenty * Two Parking Discounted parking is available at the Pinnacle Garage at Symphony Place (3rd Ave. and Demonbreun St.). We will provide guests with the option to purchase 2-hour parking for only $2.00.See map here. ""Sigh.

"2704 Gallatin RdNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I read the other reviews before writing mine. True--this is the Americanized Mexican style restaurant. It is not authentico. However, it is very good in this class of Mexican fare. The new facility is much better than their original spot down the road. Pros: they have the best salsa in town. That is sort of my standard of these types of restaurant. If the salsa is bad--the rest of the chessy, beany stuff is bad. They have great salsa. Points go to beers as big as your head. The waitstaff is always friendly. Parking and getting into the place can be a little wonky. I usually park on the right side in the strip mall lot.Last time I was there, I found my new ""go-to"". The fajita nachos with chicken was very good. The chunks of chicken were tasty and the placement of beans and other toppings on each piece of tortilla was thoughtful and even. Most of the time at similar Mexican restaurants--this dish is just dumped on the plate and it is a gross mass of beans, meat, and stuff thrown together. This was visually pleasing and palatable. Tasted great.Cons: When it is crowded (like at dusk on a summertime weekend night)--the feng shui is fouled up in there. There isn't a good spot to wait on a table. If you get one of the seats by the door, you are constantly pulling your legs in as new customers come through the door and waitstaff weaves through the crowd to deliver food to the patio outside. Most people choose (or do so because there aren't enough seats) wait outside.

I am from Southern California, and have spent many summers in Mexico and grew up with a mix of Hispanic foods, made fresh from Abuelita's kitchen - I am picky.

Las Maracas has some really good dishes, if you are willing to get over the urge to drowned everything in queso dip and red sauce. If you order a burrito, a taco and an enchilada - you arent going to see much difference in any of the items, they are all essentially, meat, cheese and tortilla with some variation in sauce. But if you order Carne Asada tacos with onion, cilantro and pico de gallo you get away from the norm and taste some flavors.

But this can be hard to get in the rest of the US, and I actually have nothing against and actually enjoy Americanized Mexican food too. Las Maracas utterly fails even in this category where the bar is pretty low.Seriously, Taco Bell is better. I'm not kidding. At least there you have some corporate engineered flavor and not *everything* is out of a can. The salsa was basically canned crushed tomatoes with I think a wee bit of chopped cilantro. I couldn't taste an onion to save my life, and definitely not a chile.We ordered standard enchilada, burrito, tamale entrees. They were pretty much horrible. Mystery meat, cheese that I think was just regular cheap white cheddar, not even jack or a Mexican blend, and two mysterious red sauces that completely lacked any flavor at all. I'm pretty sure they came right out of a can and that can was labeled ""tomato sauce"". Could you please at least buy the can labeled ""enchilada sauce""?? It really did taste like bad pasta sauce. No spice, no flavor, no nothing. Tamales were dry and the pork was drier and tasteless. Again, covered in tomato sauce. There really is no excuse for this. Most Mexican and Americanized Mexican food is cheap by nature, which is the idea. Take cheap cuts of meat, corn and vegetables and make it taste good by adding in other cheap and tasty stuff like some spices, onions, garlic, and chiles, and using a bit of technique from mom like slow cooking your pork.

"2812 Opryland DrNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"Corny! After spending almost $200 for the two of us, I was expecting more. We come to Nashville every December and this was one of the last things that we hadn't experienced. I figured, what the heck, let's do it. Christmas time in Nashville is starting to catch on because it gets more and more crowded and more and more expensive each year. Traffic was horrific, so I was too worried to pre book the tickets. But low and behold, there were several seats available when we got there, right at 6:15 (boarding time).Parking was easier than I expected. Tons of free parking was available in the Opry Mills Mall lot, which runs parallel to the Cumberland River.  It was dark and chilly when we were standing to board, but they had an area that was blocked off with an awning like set up, so the waiting to board wasn't too bad. The waiting was the biggest annoyance. Once we finally got on board, the buffet was waiting, nice and hot. The food is the only reason I'd give it two stars. The buffet consisted of a ton of vegetables, roasted potatoes, mashed potatoes, stuffing, turkey, and roast beef. They pulled the food and stopped carving the turkey and beef at 7:45.  So you could grub until you were miserably stuffed. And then there was dessert around 8:30... that consisted of peppermint cheesecake and a sugar cookie. The wait staff were all hard to understand. I have been on countless cruises and I know some of the waitstaff there, are foreign, but this was bad. On cruises the waitstaff mingle with people close to 24/7, these guys on the showboat only few times a week. The Christmas show itself consisted of very few people.

My boyfriend and I went on a Monday night and at first were a little worried because when we look around all we saw was really OLD people, we were the youngest ones there and we were over dressed compared to everyone else. Before entering the boat, there is a person there taking pictures and we were able to take one infront of the General Jackson which I thought was pretty cool. When we actually entered onto the ship everyone spread out and it became more intimate for us. We took tons of pictures, the sun was starting to set it was just wonderful. The river was absolutly beautiful and the staff was very welcoming when entering the ship.  I found a waiter and ordered a bottle of white wine for my table to be there when we were ready to be seated. About an hour we were outside and on the upper deck having cocktails and watching the band that was playing. On a loud speaker they told everyone to enter the main dining room for dinner.The dining area was huge and looked very elegant! There was a large stage in the front with the curtain still up.  We shared the table with about 8 other people. This was nice because everyone was interacting with one another and we got to meet people from different places. When we got to our table our bottle of wine was warm, however, one of the servers realized that it was sitting there awhile and took it back and brought us a new one nice and cold. They poured us both glasses of wine and ice tea. They immediately brought us our salads and bread. I also noticed that there was a small menu on the table just in case you wanted to order more appetizers. The salad was very fresh and the dressing was very good. After salad was done they brought us dinner which was also very good but I think it could have been a little more hot. But this was understandable due to the fact there were tons of people to feed at one time. After dinner, we had about 30 mins to break away from the dinning area and they brought us to downtown Nashville where we were able to take even more pictures. The whole city lit up at night was just gorgeous and we went right under the bridge which was also lit up. When we went back into the dining area our dessert was already on the table. They forgot to bring my boyfriend and myself coffee and it was a pain to get them over to serve me. I also wanted to order Ammerato but before I had the chance to they have already walked away. During dessert the show started and it was excellent!

I called general jackson customer service to see if there was a way to use our tickets for the next day or even pay a penalty fee to reschedule. Let's just say the customer service rep's have a thing or two to learn about ""southern manners and hospitality"" . No way were they budging! We had to buy tickets all over again. Fast forward 24 hours, a few tears and sniffles later, we boarded general Jackson's showboat and the rest is history. Overall, Buyers-beware!!!

So, dinner is served.  BonelessChicken breast was so-so, boxed stuffing was extremely salty, small potatoes, broccoli and a slice of tomato.  My husband was one of the last still eating .  Boy was he surprised when the waiter grabbed the fork right out of his right hand!  The same waiter did this to the party behind us.  A glass of diet coke is $3.50 but it does include refills.Coffee was very good, and the Bunkin Chest Cake was enjoyable.  So, on with the show!  (Between dessert and the show you have an opportunity to go outside and view the downtown skyline at night.  Save for the nats, I hear this is beautiful).  Unfortunately, we did not get to see it, as we were one of the last tables to be served coffee and Bunkin cake.  The show was entertaining, covering the history of country music from the early years to modern day.   The show is similar to what you would see on a cruise ship or at Disneyland.   I always enjoy a show where they acknowledge anyone that has served our country - asking them to to stand while the entertainers sing ""Proud to be an American""  Very touching, but somewhat annoying as  50% - 80% of the servers sadly are not from this country.The waiter made it a point to ask us to stick around after the show as he would be back to say bye-bye (tip language, naturally).  After the show is over, one needs to climb 3 flights of steep stairs to get off the boat.  Many people complained.  The elderly and handicapped had a difficult time.  Some of the middle aged folks complained.  Disembarking is very strenuous,   Again, an elevator is avaiable but you can imagine the crowd and the wait.To us, not worth the $90 per person.  For $720 , our table could have done so much more.  We will not be back.",General Jackson Showboat,6154583900.0,6.0,2011-10-01,"Los Angeles, CA",/biz/general-jackson-showboat-nashville,1.0,42,"Nashville, TN",Roz Z.,36.1622296,-86.774353,34.053717,-118.24272659999998,1780.7950516038713,False,4926.0

There are also teriyaki burgers, black bean burgers, salmon burgers, and several other types, along with non-burger choices. The chicken tenders are surprisingly good. Their French fries are straight cut generic diner style fries. They are often fried perfectly, just like in a NJ diner, but once in a while they're soggy.

For these occasions I often go to Five Guys but when I saw Wayback Burgers was coming to the shopping center near Walmart on Charlotte Pike, I was definitely interested in checking it out. The premise of the place is old fashioned burgers cooked to order. They also have milkshakes and onion rings as well. I got the Wayback burger (two patties with cheese) and they let you chose whatever toppings you want too. I wasn't into trying anything different so it was just fries for me to go with my burger. I paid about $10 so it was a bit cheaper than their competitor. Although it the store wasn't super busy it took a while for my food but I do appreciate having food cooked to order so it was hot and fresh. The bun was better than you average burger bread but it also wasn't pretenious like a brioche. The meat was juicy but had a weird texture (its real beef obviously), not sure if this was because a high fat content or what. My only complaint is there was no taste. I'm not say you need some crazy seasoning but a little salt and pepper would be nice. Fries were crisp and hot, what more can you ask for?

But I did today!!  Let me start from the beginning: I tried this place for lunch today. Was seated fairly quickly by a polite hostess. All good so far. I took a look at the relatively limited menu, when compared to other Mex places like La Hacienda or Mazatlan. It took a full 10 minutes before anyone else acknowledged me. If they would have been busy, that wouldn't be a problem, but the servers were all gathered around the hostess station talking while I just kind of sat there. When my waitress finally did come up and take my order, it was pretty obvious to me that she wasn't completely comfortable in her job. Seemed new to food service altogether in my honest opinion. But, she was polite enough. Decided to order the steak Quesadilla, on the very first bite, I hit a ""meat"" chunk I couldn't chew. On my 4th bite, I hit what I could only describe as a brittle bone...that was it. Told the waitress I wanted the check. I didn't even want to fix the meal, just wanted to pay and get out. She said she would talk to her manager, who then came out. Miguel, I believe his name was. A nice guy, but he basically told me I was wrong and it couldn't be a bone in my food, because the meat they order doesn't have bones in it...?? So they must buy from those farms with boneless cows I guess. I realize that the product they buy is supposed to be bone free, but it's certainly still within the realm of possibility that a bone made its way through the process. What is scarier is that, if it wasn't a bone, then what the heck was it?!? In any case, he insisted that he make me a CHICKEN quesadilla to go. I figured ok what the heck. Took it to go and paid my $12.02 bill, leaving a $3 tip.  (that's for a quesadilla and iced tea).So I got home, thinking maybe I shouldn't write a bad review for this place. After all, as a rule I don't do Yelp reviews at all. But then I decided to try a couple bites of the chicken quesadilla just to see if it was any good. It was not great.

Yes, this is the old Casa Fiesta that has been completely redone. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt because they just opened, but this place was horrible. 3 adults & 1 child arrived there at 11:20 for lunch, was immediately seated, and then it all went down hill from there. I ordered unsweet tea which I asked for sweet and low packets. I asked 4 times from 2 different people and finally got them 25 mins later. By the time I got the packets, we all needed a refill, never got them. We were offered more chips and salsa (the salsa was really good, cold, and fresh actually) and only received more cold chips. Never got a drink refill. The kids plain cheese quesadilla took over 20 mins to come to the table. As for the 3 adult entrees we ordered?...we left after waiting an hour for them. The waitresses there were frantically running around and it was clear to see that we weren't the only table frustrated with the poor service. When we finally got to speak to the manager (i asked twice to talk to him), which was in the middle of us walking out the door, he apologized. Thanks for the apology, but this is just the tip of the ice burg: the acoustics are horrible; very loud, not a big menu, the La Parrilla that you find online to look at their menu is not this restaurant.....even though their sign and their font and colors resemble it????

"575 Stewarts Ferry PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"I'll openly admit that as I'm writing this I'm a bit annoyed. Last Sunday the boyfriend and I were too lazy to get out so we decided to try Taste of Italy since they delivered and had something to offer other than pizza. I went with the Italian club sandwich (minus hot peppers) with fries and he got the mild buffalo wings and fries. We were quoted a 20-30 min delivery time but it actually took almost an hour. My sandwich was really good! It was on yummy homemade bread and had a good amount of ham and turkey, lots of melted provolone, fresh tomatoes, and romain lettuce. (NOT shredded lettuce! Yay!) The bacon could be crispier. The fries were good but almost too salty to eat. My boyfriend liked his wings and also agreed that the fries were too salty. Here's where my annoyance sets in.... So tonight I stop by because even though It's only been 4 days, I'm already craving another Italian club sub! After I place my order I show the waitress my Yelp check in offer and she has to go ""ask her boss because she doesn't know about that."" She comes back and proceeds to tell me they don't ""do that"" and the only discount they have is for senior citizens. I told her that her boss needs to contact Yelp so people won't be led to believe that they offer a discount if in fact they don't. I SHOULD have asked to speak to the manager to clarify the issue but after the day I had I simply wasn't in the mood to argue or debate over something that I shouldn't have to argue or debate over. The manager SHOULD have came out and explained their policy to me him(her)self. Anyway, while I was seated at a table waiting for my order I noticed a little card on the table encouraging people to check in and review them on Yelp. (See pic) Seriously, any other day I would have addressed this with the manager but sometimes you just know yourself well enough to know that it's probably best to let it go for now. After reading other reviews I now see that this happened to someone else a month ago. Management responded and blamed it on a new waitress and has allegedly fixed the issue. Apparently not. I'll likely give this place another try but if they still don't honor the Yelp discount I will definitely be addressing it with the manager.

The waiter said ""I wouldn't order the Guinness pie"" he said he didn't  like it. In my mind and experience when the waiter said that. I thought of 2 things. Ether the food isn't fresh and there re heating it from a few days ago or the waiter has seen something back in the kitchen that he knows is messed up. After all the waiter does go back in the kitchen and knows how the food is prepped and handled. I do appreciate the waiter being honest. But it did make me weary of eating here.

The Gaylord Hotel has a few in-house pubs and restaurants that I feel obligated to try. Findley's is the Irish pub and is situated directly across from the sport's bar.This is a night for American Football, the padded up grid iron combat which dominates most drinking establishments. Tonight is no different - If you are wanting to watch the game, come on in. If you are wanting to escape the sports bar, this isn't it. As I sit at the bar, the Irish band sits flaccidly plucking their instruments, pining for a chance to roust the crowd. No luck tonight boys, the Red Tide is on the plasma and the bar is packed with old men reflecting on a youth long since past.Ah, now for the Guinness. The pour is a good try, with a 3/4 glass and then a pause. The challenge is that the 'tender is pouring with one eye over his shoulder spotting the score. The final may be closer to what you would find in Football Season in Dublin (that's soccer for the western crowd) - the final product is passable, but not passionate.If you need to stay within the resort area, this is decent.

I read some reviews that talk about lack of flavor. I don't see that, and neither did any of my friends. But then again we don't like super hot spicy food, just a touch of pepper for us. And this fits that bill. The salsa is the best I've had anywhere. Not super hot, but full of great flavor. Guacamole is right up there tied with the best 2 or 3, and you get a huge portion. Chips are not thin like I usually like them, but these chips are crunchy and fresh with a nice corn flavor, so I liked them. You only get a small bowl of salsa each (maybe 2 oz), and if you want more, you can buy three types plus chips. We did that last year, and I remember all 3 flavors were excellent. Ambiance was great; salsa music while sitting on the patio in the Opryland rain forest. Our server (forgot to ask her name) was a middle aged white lady with reddish hair, and she was very attentive, did a perfect job. (Manager, are you listening?)

They have a tenancy to leach and leave green stains on your clothes and arms (definitely a bad idea for an outside table). It took twenty minutes to get two drinks and an order of cheese dip. The waitress acted like she was doing a big favor by giving me free salsa (normal charge is 3 dollars). Yet she forgets to give us the chips. That took another five minutes (they were undercooked and therefore they were greasy and chewy). The cheesedip itself had good flavors and had a nice tone of cilantro but the salsa was nothing special. We both ordered fajitas (all three meats). It wasn't anything to write about and it came out right after the chips we finally got so we didn't get to enjoy the dip.

Burrito, enchilada, chicken quesadilla, rice and beans all had no flavor, no spice nothing. Tasted like overcooked browned ground beef.Chips: OK. Nothing special. Only got 1 basket because no 1 would come back to us. Left with a sick stomach, spending too much money on bad food and bad service. This was hardley a restaurant and barely food.

Flies. Dirty tables. Horrible Waiters. Disgusting Food. No Service.

As a joke - i asked the guy in front of me if he crapped his pants but it was horrible. Still we tried to keep a good face and look (or smell) past the gross first impression. We got seating right away in the corner and the decor looked like everything that a Hacienda should have but then when i looked slowly at the windows and table there was dirty and at least two flies at our table trying to escape. That's what i did for the 10 min it took to get chips - catch flies. When the chips were put on the table the guy that seated us just dropped them off and didn't take our drinks or anything. We had to literally go up and tell them to give us something to drink after 6 mins of waiting. The waiter came over (the one that seated us, who had a horrible high and tight) and asked us for our order and when he brought it back they were the wrong drinks. We waited another 10 mins and had to go up to the counter again to ask if we could so kindly be asked for our meal order. It was ridiculous. The waiter then came over and tried to make a joke of the horrible service when we asked for hot sauce and more chips he said ""no...just kidding!"" Needless to say, he got horrible looks from the four of us. I'm gonna skip ahead and just mention why the next 30 mins were a waste of my life. 1. No chips or hot sauce/guacamole as requested for 15 min. 2. 20 min wait for food. 3. Different waiter switch with no warning then he disappeared and had to go up the counter agin. 4.

I ordered the Sunday special (fried chicken) with sides of fried okra, freid apples, and chicken dumplins. The fried chicken was great as was the fried okra. The fried apples were great but are more of a dessert than a side. I wasn't too fond of the dumplins. I finished up with a multi-berry dessert with ice cream that was amazing. It sat on a berry cobbler pie, which was nice and warm.The trippy thing about this place is that the front of the restaurant is a convenience store.
