4.0,Barely there,"We dined at Bistro D'OC because it is conveniently located right across the street from Ford's theater, where we were seeing a play later in the evening. The 5:30 seating is a plus for theater goers, but the service was rushed. The waitress brought our first course and wine BEFORE our cocktail. The food was C+, not very interesting. The...

4.0,Horrible service from the top down,"This was the worst dinner experience I have ever had! I'll try to make a long story short here, but really I'm so appalled that I can't help but tell all.
The place looked cute, reasonably priced, and right across the street from Ford's Theater, where we were meeting for a walking tour later in the evening. So we went...

4.0,Superlative Languedoc fare in DC,"Located directly across the street from the theater where President Lincoln was assasinated and next door to the house where Abe, good man that he was, died, may not be the best vibe or fengshui for a restaurant. But Bistro d'Oc lays that ghost well and comes out shining.
There are French restaurants (way expensive, fine cuisine, high end wines,...

4.0,Poor management,"We went to this restaurant for a friend's birthday as a group of 16. While that is a large group, the restaurant assured us it could handle it. We were given a private room, which we felt was very nice. However, the manager insisted that he could only accept 3 credit cards for the entire group. We felt this was...

But if you want to see what bad service is, go to Bistro D'Oc. The service is not friendly. It is not attentive. The bartender probably wants to do something else than work in a bar/restaurant.

They started off by bringing me a small basket of bread and a large plate of butter. Given that they served me more butter than bread, I knew I was going to like this place.

The menu was classic bistro with daily board specials. We tried the lamb and duck specials...

4.0,Quite good,"Went to Bistro D'Oc recently with three other people and found it to be very good, though not great. The setting is wonderful French bistro, with better lighting than Bistrot du Coin and more warmth. The menu is large, maybe too large, and the food we got didn't always match the description (The special rosemary chicken came out as simple...
