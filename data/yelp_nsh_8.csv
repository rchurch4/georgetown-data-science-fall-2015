"2903 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"I had the best sandwich in the history of ever; I grabbed Bag 6 for vegetarian, selected artichoke & provolone, added hummus and a bunch of other veggies and I asked for it to be heated. It was lunch time & the restaurant was fairly busy, so I anticipated a wait, but my order was up in less than 10 minutes - so awesome.My husband, normally a carnivore, says he loved his veggie/soy/quinoa wrap thing he ate. I think it was a featured sandwich - the word ""superfood"" was in the name. The price for our meals (just sandwich & drink, no sides) rang up at less than $10 each. The parking leaves a little to be desired, but it's West End, so that's anywhere you go. Ultimately, the people are nice and the food is freaking phenomenal.

"2903 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"first time having which wich (I KNOW?!?!?! i grew up in nashville and it took me this long to try it?!) omg. its. so. good.first of all, get the hot sammich. its crunchy and fantastic and not too bready and great quality... omg yums.so how which wich operates is you walk in, and you grab from their many little bins of sandwich brown bags that you want the base of your sammich to be. may it be turkey or ham or veggie or something else, you just grab the base of the one you want. then, you can customize it. you check on the bag certain things you want to add or not have on there. Then you write your name on the bottom of it (anything you want, i've seen some hilarious ones on social media). Then you pay for it, wait for it, and they call your name out super quickly. There are 3 sizes, and believe me, the small may seem small but it really isnt! I came here and got a turkey bacon HOT sammich. It was fast, they were incredibly friendly (shoutout to the register boy) and it was DELICIOUS!!! I will DEFINITELY come back again.the small sandwich by itself was ~$4-5. definitely worth it!  I love which wich. now come to memphis. :]",Which Wich,6153299920,240 reviews,2015-09-15,"Memphis, TN",/biz/which-wich-nashville-4,5.0,70,"Washington, DC",Christine L.

"2903 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"A great sandwich at all locations. Since moving to Nashville in the fall of 2013 I have dined at a number of the locations and love the concept of ordering. Its easy, hassle free, and you are always guaranteed to receive your correct order because you write it out! So what are the cons? The price you pay for quality is lower. If your looking to grab and go then this place isn't for you. The day that I visited this location there was a moderate crowd and it took a while to receive the sandwiches, even though, in my opinion, there were more than enough staff to complete the orders placed before us. I prefer Jimmy John's, not because of their freaky fast guarantee, but because the price meets the quality.",Which Wich,6153299920,104 reviews,2014-10-17,"Nashville, TN",/biz/which-wich-nashville-4,3.0,70,"Washington, DC",Jim V.

Only 2 people in front of me and 2 more bags already hanging. After putting in my order, I sat and waited for 15 minutes before I was informed by an employee that they were out of the meat for my sandwich; however, this was not the case because another employee claimed they had it. After waiting for another 15 minutes and still no sandwich,  I went up and request a refund. I left the store after waiting a half hour with no sandwich in hand.

"2903 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"You know it's just a chain sandwich shop, but it's leaps and bounds better than the competitors. Their bread is better, and if you don't like a bread-y sandwich, you can get it 'skinny' with the extra cushion bread scraped out. Like a thin crust sandwich. Which wich has way more toppings than you're used to- all fresh and awesome. I like hummus on mine, with guac and mushrooms, and veggies galore. It's a different ordering system, since you take your time formulating your perfect sandwich recipe on a list you select. Then you give them the list bag and they whip it together. It's a really quick process. Which Wich is better than Quiznos, which is better than Subway.

"2903 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"Very similar to subway and quiznos, but with 1 main difference that really sets Which Wich apart -- customizability.At Which Wich, the world is your oyster. You can choose from their huge list of meats, cheeses, toppings, sauces, etc, and they offer some things that are hard to come by at other sub places, such as pesto sauce. You can also take as long or as short as you like and go back to previous toppings to add if you want, unlike the traditional ""line"" where you move on from section to section. What if you missed a section and wanted to go back and get, say, tomatoes! Well, at a traditional sub place, you would have to move backwards and disrupt the whole flow of sub-preparation, which would surely elicit grumbles from both the server as well as the rest of the customers. However, at Which Wich you can double check and even triple check your decision before turning it in to the cashier, after which you just have to wait and, voila!

I think that better describes my experiences.I'll start with: Their food is good. Very tasty indeed. You do get to customize your sandwich quite a bit.However, it takes so long for them to actually make your sandwich. It took 9 minutes from when I placed my order to actually receiving my sandwich. It sounds persnickety, but there was nobody in front of me and there is no reason an uncooked sandwich should take more than a couple minutes to put together. Also, the food is not cheap.

"2903 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"I guess I should review Which Wich now that I am apparently the Duchess of it?The major contributing factor to my Duchess-ness is that I work right down the street. I even walked there yesterday. Otherwise I don't think I'd go nearly as much. It's a pretty average sandwich place with a gimmicky ordering system, a ton of options and a convenient location. Nothing spectacular, but a decent place for a toasted turkey sandwich. It can be a little weird the first time you go, but basically you pick a bag from the meat category of your choice and fill in the bubbles with a sharpie to choose your toppings, etc.  They hang the bags up on a wire over the assembly line of workers who pass it down the row.Amuse yourself while waiting in line by drawing on your bag and giving yourself a fake name for them to call out when your food is ready.

It was yummy, did take a bit longer than I expected, but not that much longer. We both got combos and their chip selection is kind of average, kind of like at Subway. Since my small combo with tax was over $8.50, I think they should do a little better with chips or maybe some other side items. They also have rolls of paper towels near the drink machine.

"2903 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"My brother has been going on and on about how Which Wich is the bomb dot com and I finally gave in and went with him today. The ordering process for a newbie was a little overwhelming but in that awesome holy shit my brain is going to explode from all the excellent choices way! Choose your meat (chicken, turkey, seafood, beef, ham, etc) or not. Then take the corresponding bag and start marking the toppings off that you want. I actually started on one and realized I should have read ahead to see what my options were before capriciously choosing things. So I threw that bag away and started over. They also have sandwiches like meatloaf and BLTs. I didn't get the BLT this time because what toppings are you going to put on that really but I will get it next time. They only have one size so you don't have to choose that but the sandwich is plenty big...if you are bitching about the size of the sandwich you probably don't have any clue what a normal serving size is (hint: this sandwich is way more than one serving technically). Or maybe you are really really hungry - so order two or get some chips or a shake or all of the above!! Once you fill out the bag you pay at the cashier and hand them the bag. As someone else said, write something on the back of your bag too so that you can see where your sandwich is in the process. They have chips available too including my fave Terra chips. So I got chicken with cheddar cheese, fat free Italian dressing, bell peppers, peppercinis, ""hot pepper mix"", olives, salt, pepper, and garlic. I have to say the addition of hot pepper mix was the right call, it was really good!! I have to admit, I liked it a lot. It trumps all the other deli sandwich places I've been by a long shot. I also liked the serve yourself coke and the stand with various newspapers for you to choose from.

"2903 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"This place is like a Subway's, except instead of the person making your sandwiches asking you annoying questions (""Salt? Oil? Vinegar?"") at every step of your sandwich being made, you determine all of that ahead of time. Unlike a Subway's, there are more choices here.I came in here elated at their setup: Go to a wall that has a line of bags grouped by type of filling/meat. You take a red marker and indicate your choices directly on the bag per sandwich type. Write your name, take it to the cashier, and minutes later, the sandwich maker calls out your name with the sandwich already bagged inside it.

I thought they'd bring out a bottle of vinegar and a bottle of oil, but it's some concoction that doesn't separate and doesn't really look like oil and vinegar. I was SOOO hesitant to get a salad cause you just never know at restaurants. They're usually cheap and pointless, but I guilt tripped myself into getting it. BIG MISTAKE.

The resturaunt was clean and the service was average but there was a bizarre moment when the waiter/host stopped helping customers and  began performing live music. I know it's Nashville and being the home of country music is kind of the shtick, but it was a fail. The guy was pretty terrible and began by asking for requests from customers but didn't know any of the requested songs. Instead, he sang some ""originals"" that reinforced my two star rating. My advice... Catch a taxi or drive downtown and enjoy the real Nashville atmosphere and cuisine this place is trying to reproduce.",Opry Backstage Grill,6152318854,4 reviews,2015-07-30,"Yelm, WA",/biz/opry-backstage-grill-nashville,2.0,56,"Washington, DC",Rick Y.

"2401 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"We had to wait 10 minutes to be seated though the Reasturant was half empty.  The hostess repeatedly took calls from people phoning in take out orders and had no time to seat us.  So we were not to jolly to start out, but a host did seat us and he was friendly and good to us. We split the soup of the day which was corn chowder, easily the best I have ever had.  Not too thick, not too thin, well seasoned and cooked just right.  There were some red and green bits in it that added to the flavor and appearance. My entree was the southern chicken dish.   The coating was excellent and cooked just right.  I think the chicken underneath could have been better, but I am a bit of a chicken snob.   You can't beat a free range chicken.  The baked beans were like the soup above in terms of quality - just excellent. I had the sweet potato fries which were also spot on.  The green beans were over cooked.  Beth ordered the southern chicken salad.  The batter was good and the chicken was tender.  She had hoped for more ingredients in the salad but it was good. The waitress was wonderful and prompt. She kept the iced tea glasses full and it was fresh iced tea.  The chocolate cobbler desert was baked to order and top notch.  The entertainment was top shelf.  It was a group called Brassfield Aly, a  young group with a nice mixture of there own songs and excellent covers.",Opry Backstage Grill,6152318854,30 reviews,2014-11-29,"Carlsbad, NM",/biz/opry-backstage-grill-nashville,4.0,56,"Washington, DC",Alan J.

"2401 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"If your staying at the Gaylord Opryland Resort and looking for somewhere nearby to eat that wont cost you an arm and a leg your search is over  because this is the place to go! I must add .... also a great place to go wherever your staying in Nashville! The location of this place is right across the street from the Gaylord Opryland and is at the sister hotel os the resort, its called the Inn at the Gaylord. Shuttles are available to take you there if your staying at the resort. Great friendly service, great food, great drinks and great prices! Came here about two months ago with my boyfriend from New Jersey while staying in Nashville and absolutely loved it! We first ordered two Tennessee ice teas to drink before the Jet Titan game . Pretty much, it's a Long Island with moonshine in it. Fantastic! Perfect to drink before heading to a game because this sure will get you pretty buzzed! You won't be disappointed! Our waiter made the drinks himself, when we told him this was our first time in Nashville and never tried moonshine before, he made us the Tennessee teas and then poured the moonshine in last on top without mixing it so we can taste the moonshine without having it already mixed into the drink. Super nice of him. During the course of our meal he came and checked in on us and also gave us great advice about the best places to go during our stay in Nashville. We then had the BBQ Nachos, and I must say, my nacho eating experience will never be the same after this place! This is the true definition of foodgasim! It's nachos with beans, sour cream, peppers, cheese, and pulled pork full of the most delicious bbq I have ever had! The pulled pork here is soooooo tender and perfectly cooked.   We got this like three times during our stay here, yea it was that good. Since we loved the nachos we also ordered the pulled pork sandwiches which were also just as good.The place was very clean and the ambiance was very country but like classy country. Beautiful decor. It's also a very space restaurant which is great for large groups as well. It had both tables, booths and a bar to sit drink and eat at as well. This will not be the last time I come here!

It was the kind of service you get when a waiter's shift is about to come to an end and they really don't care if they get a good tip out you.

My fiance ordered the ""barbecued"" brisket, potato salad and Mac n' Cheese.Let me start by saying we put our order in and literally 5 minutes later our food came out. That sends a big RED flag! I know restaurants cut corners with some things, but this is ridiculous.Obviously this food was prepared way before we got there! The fried chicken was okay, the potato salad was decent and the mashed potatoes was the best thing on my plate. I tasted my fiance's brisket and it was edible.

"2401 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"While staying in Nashville for conference at the Gaylord for 1 week and several overpriced, disappointing meals at the Gaylord resort/convention Center, I invited my two friends over to my hotel to have dinner at the backstage grille. We were all really impressed and had such a good time having dinner and drinks here! We first started at the bar waiting for our table, which took awhile because the place was packed but we didn't mind because they had $4 beers and $7-8 glasses of wine (not $10-15 like we had been paying). Once at our table, the server was very friendly and told us all about the specials. We had the fried green tomatoes for appetizer that were so tasty, almost bordering on beating my moms :) Be aware that the brisket must be popular and happened to be out this night. Luckily I was in the mood for fried chicken after listening to a little of zac brown band and wetting my appetite at the bar. It was the BEST fried chicken ever- finger licking good plus three southern sides to choose for $12.95, what a deal!! The servings were very generous. Make sure you go here with a good appetite.On top of great southern food and hospitality, the atmosphere really made you feel like you were downtown Nashville.

"2401 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I read the reviews and almost ""went out"" to eat as I was staying at the Gaylord Inn....but I decided to go for it and eat at The Grill. I went to the bar to eat and Fred greeted me shortly after I sat down. But that was the only ""shortly"" for the rest of my dinner. The restaurant was not at that full and half of the stools at the bar were taken. I got my beer and started looking at the menu and decided to go with the Trace Atkins catfish. I am going to go ahead and say right now that Trace does not know he lended his name to this sorry excuse for catfish. I made my selections and closed the menu, a clear signal to any waiter that an order is ready to be taken. Literally four pass by's later I let Fred know that I was ready to order. I did and the food took a little longer to come than what I had hoped but not obnoxiously long...but my beer was dry and I pushed it the edge of the counter and Fred just kept waking by. After I got his attention, he refilled my beer. Two seats down from me, same deal, another guy had to get Fred's attention to get him another beer. My food came and the portion was not small but not huge either...I had been driving for 9.hours with just a small bag of beef jerky and peanuts so I was famished. I also got the coleslaw, fries and broccoli with cheese. The coleslaw was clearly old, the fries were a tad soggy and the cheese on the broccoli was...gritty? All in all the meal was just right at average. The total bill was $23 and if it had been higher I would have possibly complained but clearly here, you get what you pay for. When I was done, once again I had to grab Fred's attention. When I got my bill, I paid and Fred was actually quick to close me out. So, he was quick to greet and quick to close out but in between he could use some help. I don't think I will be back tomorrow night as I am in town for two nights.

"2401 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"This is a fun looking restaurant that will probably get better with time. My husband said he thinks it is more about the environment and less about the food. We asked the shuttle driver at our hotel about this restaurant and she said hotel guests have told her that it was good but that the portions were small and that people said it wasn't worth the money for the amount of food you get. We actually appreciated that it wasn't a huge amount of food- we didn't leave feeling over-full, which was refreshing.It's located inside the Radisson hotel but I think it is owned by Gaylord Opryland (hence the name). :) It is a convenient walk from the Opryland Hotel. As you walk in, it has a cute gift shop area with a lot of things I liked- clever and unique gift items. Our server was very honest and when we asked questions about things on the menu she often would say ""I wouldn't recommend that"" (such as pigs n' peanuts and the chocolate gravy dessert) and explain why. We really appreciated that though it did strike us as a little strange. She also told us the things that were known to be good and that she liked, and that was helpful. She said they are adding fried green tomatoes to their menu this weekend, which sound good. She really seemed to know the menu well and we were impressed with that. The young man who brought our meal and dessert out was especially pleasant and friendly.It seemed like a long time to wait for our meal. I had the deviled egg salad BLT. It was pretty good. The bacon on the sandwich was different (and there wasn't much of it) and I'm not sure if it was real bacon. The flavor of the egg salad was good. The plate was very hot, the bread was dry and kind of cold and the egg salad was almost all on one half of the sandwich. The waffle fries were awesome, kind of like Chick-Fil-A, and I asked for some barbecue sauce on the side instead of ketchup and that made them delicious! The barbecue sauce was very tasty.My husband had the beef and cheese open face sandwich. He ended up using much of my side of barbecue sauce to add to his sandwich and he said it made it tons better- he enjoyed it and wanted me to make sure I suggest in my review that you add barbecue sauce to this sandwich. They said they had a new dessert item- chocolate almond cake. It wasn't like what we were expecting but it was very good and came with a big scoop of whipped cream which made it even better.Some of the servers sing on a little stage in the restaurant and we also heard a small band that was good. Other times they play videos from the Grand Ole Opry from different times in its history. Overall it was a pretty good experience but seemed to be lacking energy.

"2401 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"The only reason this restaurant doesn't get at least three or even four stars is because there isn't nary a single vegetarian entree on its menu.  In a nation with an out-of-control obesity epidemic, not to mention heart disease and diabetes being major killers, what large restaurant these days doesn't have a single darn healthy entree from which its customers can choose?  Mind you, what also adds insult to injury is that this is a hotel restaurant, so many of its patrons are stuck here (and stuck here, indeed- what other options are surrounded by this hotel, the Radisson @ Opryland?  Shoney's, Bob Evans, McDonalds, and a seafood restaurant across the street.  That's it.).  What saves this place from only 1 star is that the night I was there, the chef on duty that night was *very* nice at coming out and making a special pasta entree for me (which was delish), though again, why don't the owners of this place just create a veggie burger option for lunch & a healthy vegetarian entree for dinner?  Even the sides are very carb- and fake-cheez heavy, and the salads, well, guess what?  All have meat as their centerpiece.  P.S.- Am only saying 'no' for kids, because, news flash- kids are getting stuffed like prize turkeys in this country, too, and deserve to have healthy food on the menu for them as well!  Granted their parents would still probably order them fried this & cheezy and salty that, but there should still be a CHOICE.  P.S.S. - Adding that, for breakfast, they actually used those rehydrated eggs-from-powder ... tasted like yellow chunks of chalk.  Pork on, America!",Opry Backstage Grill,6152318854,11 reviews,2012-05-28,"Portland, OR",/biz/opry-backstage-grill-nashville,2.0,56,"Washington, DC",Christian B.

"2401 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I tried the Opry Backstage Grill about two weeks after they opened.  To say they are having some birthing pains would be an understatement.  I should say that I live less than 2 miles from the place and I think it's intended for the folks who will eat their once on a family trip and will get a kick out of singing servers and will pick something up at the giftshop on the way out--obviously, I was sad to see Apple Bees (though not the best) replaced with mediocre food--food that even good sangin' can't make enjoyable.  The server was very attentive..took my order and swore everything on the menu was wonderful.  I love fresh smoked ribs and love Memphis style dry rub ribs the most--so that's what I ordered.  When they arrived at the table, they were mush--they didn't just slide off the bone, they were fatty mush on the bone.  I also found it rather odd that their dry rub ribs were in fact, wet--served with lots of BBQ sauce.  I took one bite and couldnt deal with the fat.  I asked the server if I had gotten the right item and he knew immediatly that I was referring to the fact that they weren't DRY rub ribs.  He said that their dry rub ribs are served wet.. (I will pause so everyone can let that sink in--huh?)Obvioulsy, I wasn't terribly impressed this answer.  He said that was a common complaint--again...not terribly impressed.  I wasn't really in the mood to eat dinner after this so I sent the ribs back and ordered Dolly Parton's Banana Pudding.  Dolly Parton would not be impressed either.  The menu listed the item as a delicious banana pudding with a warm baked meringue.  It was vanilla pudding in a wine glass with chopped up bananas, crunchy nilla wafers and the stuff on top--not even the manager could tell me what it was.  It wasn't really whipped topping and it wasn't meringue--it was some sort of frosting.  I asked her if it was meringue and if it was baked--""no--it doesn't appear to be"" to both questions.  It's not that it tasted terrible (it was as good as something you would get served at a conference rubber chicken meal)--it was that it wasn't anything close to what was advertised.The manager was very apologetic and admitted that they had some quality issues and offered to take the ribs of my ticket--very generous of her considering I only ate two bites before sending them back. She also admited that the banana pudding was not correct and was not anything close to what is mentioned on the menu--but she still charged me.  This to me, is the nail in the coffin.  Bad food AND bad customer experience and then to have to pay for the joy of hearing a server sing a B- version of a Garth Brooks song--no thanks.  I won't be back ""y'all.""",Opry Backstage Grill,6152318854,3 reviews,2011-08-26,"Nashville, TN",/biz/opry-backstage-grill-nashville,2.0,56,"Washington, DC",Aaron C.

I just had my one and only meal at the Backstage Grill.  I tried their Southern Buttermilk Fried Chicken and instead of corn and potatoes I had Coleslaw and Mac N Cheese. They claim their chicken is Iron Skillet fired, maybe it is, but it sure is cooked in advance, From the time my server took my order until it was delivered to my table wasn't more than 10 minutes, no way their cooking Laminate, their attempting to hold it and serve as the orders come in. The Coleslaw had a bitter note with a heavy hand on the celery seed. The Mac N Cheese was luke warm less than 100 degrees and wasn't a very complimentary blend of cheese's, it tasted strange. The chicken was luke warm, at best it was 100 degrees which spells their going to make someone sick holding food in the danger zone.  I mentioned the food issues to my server who took the plate away with an apology. He returned once again with a freshly plated meal and told me to be careful the plate was hot. Once again the Mac N Cheese was not any warmer than the 1st plate and the chicken was just maybe a tad warmer, not piping hot as it should be. What little chicken I did eat had a off putting flavor and texture. The coating was both grainy on the palette and lacked any seasoning what so ever.

I like the overall setup of the bar, with the two levels. Although it can get pretty crowded. The second time I went, my brother and I went to watch an Alabama game. This was a pretty good experience and didn't really have any issues.They have a pretty decent beer selection (as long as you're not a craft beer snob) and also a fairly large food selection. The prices are a little bit high, considering what you're getting though. My brother and I tried the fried pickle chips which were decent. We make it a point to try and find the best fried pickles so we try them everywhere we go (if they have them, of course). These were mostly average, but had some pretty good seasoning.I've only had the burgers here so I can't really testify to the quality of anything else. The South of the Border Burger has some really good spice behind it (I'm a spice wimp though, so it probably isn't that spicy to the average person) and I liked the coolness of the avocado to balance it out. I've also tried the Mushroom and Swiss Burger which, again, was fairly decent. Sweet potato fries both times (of course) which were perfect the first time but the second time had an overabundance of salt on them, almost to the point of being inedible. But it could've just been an off day since the first time they were pretty damn good. My brother went with me once and he had the Nest Burger, which he seemed to really enjoy.Overall, the Crow's Nest is a pretty decent bar but in a terribly placed area. There is valet parking, however there are probably only 20 spots available. I park down the street in a strip mall parking lot and walk the one block it takes to get there. Beware! Do NOT park in the Kroger parking garage because you WILL be towed if you're not at Kroger! I've seen a security guy outside patrolling both times I've been here, so you've been forewarned. I would definitely come here again, though, because the environment is decent and the staff is always super friendly.",Crow’s Nest,6157830720,132 reviews,2014-02-21,"Smyrna, TN",/biz/crows-nest-nashville-2,4.0,68,"Washington, DC",Holly G.

After more than 10 minutes of sitting and making eye contact with 2 different waitresses that we could see through the windows, NOBODY had come outside. I finally went inside and asked for a waiter. 5 minutes later, a guy came outside and gruffly asked us if anybody had taken our drink order. He did not greet us, apologize for the wait, or exchange any sort of pleasantries. We were still talking to him when he turned around and walked away (this happened multiple times throughout our visit). The water was inattentive and acted like we were an inconvenience. When I asked a question about the ahi tuna salad, he replied ""I have no idea; I haven't tried it."" He didn't attempt to find somebody else who could answer my question or ask somebody else for me.

"2221 Bandywood DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I want to like this place.  It's cool and a definite upgrade from the Box Seat.  You may or may not know that the former business at this location was extremely shady.  They were selling drugs, hookers, AND running a backdoor card game!  I believe that there was also quite a legendary shouting match between Steve McNair and his wife there.  The Box Seat was nasty and it wasn't hard to figure out how they were making their Green Hills rent (lots of tax-free income).So, in comes Crow's Nest.  It's really pretty.  It has a bar upstairs and downstairs!  There are tvs all over the place and they have a good beer menu.  They really made over the building beautifully and added a second floor.Here's my issue with them.  The food is horrible.  I've tried all kinds of things.  Everything is dry and bland.  I even know the guy that supplies their chicken and he said it was awful one night.  I work around the corner from this place and have been there at least a dozen times.  It's just not good.If you go, get appetizers and beer.  My softball team had a get-together there last night and we had a couple of guys go out to eat afterward (to avoid their food).  I ordered the Cuban and it was...bland and dry. The tvs are also not arranged in a very effective manner.  There are several seats (especially downstairs) where you can't see a single one.  There aren't many good bars in Green Hills.  I prefer the Green House, but if you want to watch a game, then Crow's Nest might be your best bet.  Unfortunately, it's nothing like the bars in Cool Springs.  If you go, you might as well sit at one of the bars and get a beer.  That works.  Just don't eat an actual meal there.",Crow’s Nest,6157830720,171 reviews,2013-11-12,"Franklin, TN",/biz/crows-nest-nashville-2,2.0,68,"Washington, DC",Adam V.

"2221 Bandywood DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"Sad, sad food. If you eat here, get the hamburger or be prepared to be sad as well. My boyfriend got a hamburger and was much less sad. Although, the hamburger was supposed to have an egg on top but they ran out out eggs... good thing he was too hungry to care!I ordered pasta. I know, I don't know what I was thinking ordering non-pub food from a pub. The pasta wasn't made the way I asked (without the red pepper, ew!), and was literally swimming in a combination of way too much olive oil and water. The water must have either been dumped in with the overcooked noodles or leftover from the frozen spinach they must use.  I am only more sad today because there is no food in my house and I'm forced to eat the leftovers again merely as sustenance to get me through to the moment I can go find some real food.I thought perhaps since my non-pub food was so horrible that my pub-fare appetizer of fried pickles would at least be good, but those turned out to be burnt and/or fried in some really old oil.

My Bloody Mary was mildly spicy and quite refreshing, although free of the ""salads"" you get with some of them. I had the Crab Cakes Benedict and it was excellent. There was more crab than filler, which is always a plus, and the cakes were crispy and firm. The crab was real and fresh. The smoky cheddar mashed potatoes side dish were very good as well. Companion's egg sandwich was fine, but nowhere near as good as mine. The warm biscuits, offered up before the food came out, were light and good, but neither of us braved the mystery gravy.

Its a great place to go to catch your out of state team(s).  I was here to watch/support  the Giants and the Chiefs and make fun of any Jets fans, the forlorn and rejected. The whole building is studded with TVs featuring all of Sundays NFL match ups. Find the game you are most interested in and pull up a seat or a table. There was plenty of room for all.The bar will have everything you could want and they have a large and varied menu. I wanted to give my liver a break this afternoon so i decided to try the lemonade. It was terrible. It was a giant glass of that powdered mix stuff,  Whyler's drink mix or Country Time. How hard is it to squeeze out some lemons and sweet syrup into a glass?  A real lemonade or limeade is worth the effort.  If your business is food/beverage why do you spend $100k on TV equipment but not $3k on a commercial citrus juicer?The fried pickles were odd enough for me to enjoy but the chips n' salsa was phoned in. The chips were cold and the salsa, your basic 7-11 brand. This may be the only place i would pass on the chips and salsa. It was that lousy! Heck, I've eaten nachos for breakfast. Ask, my mom!Anyway, If you want to catch your NFL games and have a few drinks, this place is a good spot. The kitchen needs some reworking though.

"2221 Bandywood DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"his isn't a fair review and I will be the first to admit it. This is a review of my experience being here with a group for my high school reunion. We paid a fee per person for a buffet. I don't know if the resturant got all of the $25 a person we paid but the buffet consisted of grill chicken kebabs, queso, salad, fish cakes, nacho chips, and various dressings and condiments. For approximately 75-100 people, there was only a folding table for the buffet. We paid regular bar prices for our drinks.The layout includes a large open area in the middle which was not conducive to a large group gathering. On one side, there was the bar and barely enough room to squeeze between it and the wall of the open area. The other side was tables.The evening started badly for me when my wife and I were told to move to the deck because ""this area was reserved for customers"" and they were not making money on us. I rather doubt that they needed the space based on the lower area of the place being mostly empty all night. Plus I thought we were customers. But I guess paying $25 a head and buying drinks doesn't make you one here. Our party was supposed to stay on the front deck area you can probably see on the web.  The bartenders were nice but hardly anyone ate from the menu. I didn't see anyone asking about menu items all night. At the same time, I don't recall any serversoffering either.This might be a nice place to go for a small group to drink and eat bar food but for a large gathering, find another venue with better traffic flow and attitude. I suspect $25 a person plus bar tab is more than they would ever make on a guest.",Crow’s Nest,6157830720,8 reviews,2012-06-21,"Huntsville, AL",/biz/crows-nest-nashville-2,2.0,68,"Washington, DC",Joel S.

The brunch menu for the Crow's Nest is simple divine. Everything is delicious from their Green Eggs and Ham (served with pesto, yum) to the quail scotch eggs with hash browns and fresh fruit. Love going here on the weekends for brunch. I usually sit at the bar and chat it up with the tender while he or she mixes yum mimosas (because what else do you have with brunch?!).On a weeknight this place is totally chill with great beers and mixed drinks and killer Long Island Ice teas (seriously. It's citrus-y in a really good way). Technically a sports bar but you can easily go and still have conversations without shouting over fans.

I'm sure management thinks it's cute to so this, and Twan probably needs the job, so he humbly accepts the mark of shame.

They have a large selection of sides but I would stay away from the mac n' cheese, it's not very good.

A local chain, each franchisee can do things just a little bit differently if they want, but most things are the same. This location is one of the more dated in the Nashville area, and the service, while quick, isn't always the friendliest. The food is serviceable, the barbeque isn't the best or worst I've had. It's comfortably mediocre. The sauces are pretty good, and the sides are ho-hum, but it's about quickness and convenience when you come here.

They chose Bar-B-Cutie, and a few calls later we were pulling into the parking lot. I stood in line, staring at the large menu board, totally lost. I don't eat a lot of meat, and very, very rarely consume pork. I finally turned to one of the officers and said, ""What's good here?"" I quickly had three pairs of eyes staring back at me, ""You've NEVER been here before?! Oh my gosh!"", followed by a plethora of suggestions. ""You MUST try the banana pudding! Sooooo good.""I know I am not the best person to recommend such food, but I settled on a simple pulled pork sandwich with their sweet barbecue sauce. It seemed the least scary. The sandwich was huge! Far more than I could eat in one sitting, and it truly was quite good.The fries were thick-cut and good too. Their sweet tea has that Southern, but not too sweet taste that I like. Oh, and he wasn't kidding. The banana pudding is great, and it also is sold as a generous helping.I have been back several times just for the pudding and a gallon of their sweet tea.Those guys sure did eat a LOT of food, and said it was their favorite place to dine in the area.

I tried Bar-B-Cutie for dinner tonight and was VERY impressed.I wasn't expecting fireworks due to the fact that this place is a chain. I ordered a pulled pork plate with mac n cheese, turnip greens, and sweet tea. My boyfriend ordered a pulled pork sandwich and fries. The sweet tea was on point. Perfect Southern tea. The mac n cheese is probably something I wouldn't order again. It had the texture of those weird mac n cheese things from Chef Boyardee. Gross. The flavor wasn't terrible but it definitely didn't taste homemade or fresh. The turnip greens...wow. They're my favorite vegetable and this place definitely did them justice. The meat was amazing...and plentiful on the plate. Rich flavor without being overwhelmingly smokey. The BBQ sauce was also great. It reminded me of BBQ sauce at Memphis joints, so no complaints there. The fries were good and my boyfriend liked his BBQ sandwich, even though it barely had any meat in it and was the size of a $0.99 burger at Wendy's. I questioned whether it even had meat on it until he unwrapped it. Places in Memphis give you more meat than bun, so maybe this is just the norm here. We also got fried pickles, which were good. I would just suggest a quick squeeze with a paper towel (or 4) before eating...LOTS of extra grease. All in all, awesome. $20 for all of that?!

I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the pulled pork and ribs.  I'll admit, I'm not a huge barbecue chicken fan, but it wasn't too bad at all.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting some good southern food in a timely manner.",Bar-B-Cutie,6158346556,3 reviews,2010-09-12,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bar-b-cutie-nashville-2,4.0,54,"Washington, DC",Troy S.

The service was a tad slow, with hardly anyone in the restaurant, but I think the waiter was trying to give us adequate time. But we weren't a fancy group and it didn't take long for us to make our selections. I started with the gulf crab salad - it was good. Not great. It was certainly ""crabby"", but I was left wanting a bit more. Maybe I should have gone with something hot.A co-worker had the sweet onion bisque; however, mentioned it was only lukewarm upon arrival and quickly became ""too sweet.""I had the ribeye for an entree. I hovered between medium and medium rare, and should have stuck with the medium. Just a little too rare for my liking - I did end up sending it back for a few additional minutes of cooking, which the chefs happily did, so that was appreciated.We ordered mac n' cheese and mushrooms for the table - very tasty and plenty to go around for everyone.

"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"Capitol Grille has been on my wishlist for a while, but the night I had my first meal there it was almost unintentional!  We were going to see Kinky Boots at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center, and we needed to grab dinner first.  I suggested we try the Oak Bar at the Hermitage Hotel less than a block from the theater, since they share a kitchen with the upscale restaurant.  Well, it turns out EVERYONE had the same idea, so the bar was jam-packed while the restaurant was wide open.  In addition, the show was starting 30 minutes earlier than usual, so we had just over an hour to eat.  What are two hungry girls to do?  Sit down to a fancy meal at the Capitol Grille, of course.Our server knew we had a timeline, but that doesn't mean he skimped on service!  Everything was so professional and formal.  We started the meal off with wine; there was a great selection, and my cabernet was delicious.First off, I must compliment their bread basket.  I was famished, and they brought out a basket with three types of delicious, warm bread.  It was yummy!  The little rolls were my favorite, because they reminded me of the bread used for Chick-fil-a Chick-n-Minis.  (I'm so fancy... can't you taste this gold?)I know my last restaurant review featured a burger, but I swear I don't just eat burgers all the time!!!  In this case, I felt a little guilty splurging on steak after splurging at Kayne Prime just a week earlier, so I decided I would sample the beef by choosing the more affordably-priced burger and fries.  I added a fried egg, because that's what I always do when given the option with my burger.  (I'm thinking of starting to order my burgers ""à cheval"" in the French style,  so it sounds fancier.)The burger was delicious.  The meat quality was noticeably excellent, and it was prepared perfectly.  Very, very tasty!  I'd put it on par with the classic burgers at some of the better burger places in Nashville.   I'd like to come back for a fancy date night someday.",Capitol Grille,6153457116,155 reviews,2015-02-18,"Franklin, TN",/biz/capitol-grille-nashville,4.0,138,"Washington, DC",Aubrey W.

I wanted to come here because I read Taylor Swift say in an interview once that she took her Mom here for Mother's Day brunch once and fell in love and I had a similar experience. the ambience definitely takes you to a different time period. When we arrived, the staff was very friendly. Our waitress Trisha was very sweet, explained all the menu options in a way that made you want to order everything because it sounded so delicious! She was also very kind and accommodating to my different food sensitives and double checked with the chef which was very caring.  The food is all very consciously-sourced which was reflected in the taste and high quality! I had the double stacked burger with a delicious salad (almonds and sundried blueberries can anyone say YUM!!) my mom got a tasty trout dish and fresh grilled squash and my dad had lamb loin which was cooked to perfection and very pretty (decorated with edible flowers). The ingredient combinations with each dish are inventive and uniquely delicious. We had a slight delay with two of our plates and Tim, the manager was so kind and apologetic to us (even though we didn't mind much!). He came by several times and explained that they were short staff and really took the extra effort to make sure he could make our experience as positive as possible! And he and the chef Garrett comped our entire meal because of the wait!

"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"I really enjoyed the oak bar when we went there last time, but it was packed so we opted to eat upstairs.The pork belly and grits was to be expected. A few bites of salty, fatty melt in your mouth goodness. The bread basket was pretty standard. For entrees we shared a 10oz filet and the trout. As a side we chose root veggies. The steak was amazing. The salty/Rosemary crust was perfect. The trout and root veggies, however, left me wanting more or less something else. The filet of trout was very very tiny. I imagine had we not ordered the 10oz steak, one of us would have left a little hungry. The skin on the trout was nice and crispy, but slightly under-salted. The root vegetables were undercooked and a bit dry.  After-dinner coffee was French press and pretty good. With a bill of around $150, I'd probably suggest eating someplace else.

"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"We chose the Capital Grill for a birthday celebration with our family on a Monday night.  Having never been there before, we were looking forward to the experience since it is consistently rated in the top 10 in Nashville.  Located in the very beautiful, 5-star rated Hermitage Hotel, the atmosphere is quite casual with lots of light and English Oak looking panel walls.  The service was attentive except for it looked like there was only one head waiter for the entire dining room, probably due to a Monday night.  The remainder of the wait staff seemed somewhat young with the result that they had difficulty matching up who ordered what.For appetizers we had onion soup and caesar salad, both of which were excellent.  For main dishes, the dry aged ribeye was good, but a little tasteless considering the $65 price.  The 10oz. filet was exceptional.  The beef spare ribs were very good and very savory.  The trout was really disappointing, small and tasteless.  In general, the dishes were beautifully presented, but included somewhat odd vegetables and sauces.  Mac and cheese as a side was delicious.  Brussel sprouts were under cooked; very hard in the center.  We also thought the desserts were only average, especially considering the claim that they are made by the kitchen's pastry chef.There is an extensive, good, but expensive wine list.  They did allow us to try the dessert wines and pay for only those we liked.The head waiter was very personable and it was a fun night.  I only wish the food was as good as the night.",Capitol Grille,6153457116,45 reviews,2014-12-31,"Mt Juliet, TN",/biz/capitol-grille-nashville,4.0,138,"Washington, DC",Jack K.

Don't worry about parking either, free valet for 2 hours for dining patrons! Now, you are downstairs, you have been seated. If you like iced tea, well this is a treat, it comes with a little pitcher of simple syrup! If you enjoy an old-fashioned, well give yourself a few minutes to pick a bourbon. Feeling fancy? They have my fave champagne in the 375ml bottle. Moet and Chandon Imperial. You must try the onion bisque. It is the most decadent and unusual soup. Velvety and luxe. It's like a warm blanket of cream and onions.  My mother had the beef broth which she said was outstanding. Coming from a woman who makes her own beef barley soup this is high praise. The garlicky grits are a wonderful addition to any meal as well!On a last trip we had the pork dish which was outstanding. If you are between to dishes, simply ask your server. I've never been steered in the wrong direction by any of them!Same room for desert the coconut cake and their in house ice cream and sorbets are phenomenal. Once I had popcorn ice cream!

"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"Had some friends in from Jerzey so we decided to get a reservation. Good idea.Obviously the decor is nothing less than classy but it's all about the food for me! I had the North Atlantic Squid aka fried calamari. Excellent; fresh, tender......and yes breaded in corn meal!  My wife had the beet salad and loved it. Guests had the Sweet Onion Bisque and didn't make a peep for 10 minutes while he enjoyed every drop. I had the Painted Hills Ribeye for entree which was good but not prime by any means. Meat can only get so good then you hit the wall. This hit the floor at best. My guests had the Dry Aged Ribeye which was a much better cut. The wife had Hanger Steak and liked it. For dessert me and my wife whacked up the coconut cake which was amazing.The service was impeccable. Knowledgable staff; decanted the wine I bought from home then poured it for us. A 2004 Oreno for those who care. (needs another few years in the cellar)Ended the evening at the bar with their signature drink the Jack Mule.

"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"I had tried the Capitol Grille in Washington DC, and since I was staying at the Hermitage Hotel, Capitol Grille seemed like an easy option!I am so disappointed to have had wasted my time and money at this restaurant. Reasons: poor service, mediocre food, and the old and dingy ambiance.Dinner at Capital Grille: our party was seated quickly and greeted by our waiter, very polite and professional. The restaurant started to get very busy. We were in Nashville for a conference, along with another 5000+ attendants and apparently the restaurants in the downtown area were not prepared for such a large volume of customers. Therefore, the restaurant was short-staffed and this caused a lot of delay and some errors in our service. We had to wait about 20 minutes for our drinks. Then another 20 minutes for our waiter to come and take our order. When the food was served, the staff misplaced things: gave me the soup spoon while someone else on our table had ordered the soup, put my side of vegetables for another guest at my table. This was very frustrating. Also, we did not get the bread and butter until maybe about 10 minutes before our food arrived.   The filet that I ordered to be prepared ""medium"" arrived rare in the middle and the waiter was trying to convince me that it was prepared as medium. I was very disappointed with the whole experience. The dinner took forever and it cost well over what it was actually worth. The staff later apologized about being short-staffed and they offered 2 of those in our party who were drinking wine, 2-3 refills, but I wasn't drinking any wine!!!The hotel's breakfast is also served in the Capitol Grille restaurant area in the mornings. As soon as you walk in, the smell of old grease gets very overwhelming.

"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"I'm not sure if this falls entirely on the shoulders of Capitol Grille or it's split responsibility with the hotel. This review is for their Christmas Day Brunch. Overall the brunch was beautiful but everything else fell short. First, it wasn't until after we made the reservation that we realized the restaurant was not associated with the chain Capital Grill (who we have always had amazing dinners with). So fair warning. We waited about 20 minutes for our brunch reservation, which wasn't that unexpected since we were a late day reservation. Everyone was very sweet and our server did a great job. The hotel is *gorgeous* and it was decorated to the nines for Christmas. It was really breathtaking to see all of the decorations and the huge tree. It totally put you in the holiday spirit! And I think this is really what you are paying for - that's the only thing that they did right. They had  brunch set up in the lobby of the hotel and we were sitting in conference chairs. Not what I was expecting. For the food - it was just bad. It was your typical wedding/conference food. Big tubs of mashed potatoes, green beans, stuffing etc. Whatever you can scoop. The guys at the carving station several times cut like the tiniest sliver of meat, I wondered if they were running out. My husband and I both went up for food 3 separate times and each time everything was so picked over and the ""tubs"" of food were low. The cheese station looked like it had been ravaged by a horde of starving animals. The most hilarious part of our meal had to be our fellow diners. We were easily 40 years younger than most of them. The blah food made a little more sense if you considered catering for a hundred 70 year olds. So I guess if you wanted to fork out a couple hundred bucks for brunch with your Grandma, this would be a good option. It was very beautiful but that's all you're paying for.",Capitol Grille,6153457116,177 reviews,2014-01-02,"Seattle, WA",/biz/capitol-grille-nashville,2.0,138,"Washington, DC",Sarah A.
"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"Great service on the waitress's part and a nice ambience but the food was lackluster at best. We started with the cheese board which had three decent hard cheeses, but no jams, honey or creamy accompaniments (which I personally think are a must). The sweet onion soup tasted too rich and a little off, while the mashed potatoes were tasteless and served cold. The macaroni and cheese was probably the only redeeming part of the meal.

"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"Some people may become teary-eyed with nostalgia when remembering their favorite childhood pet, or the day they walked their daughter down the aisle. This is the way I feel about the onion bisque at the Capitol Grille. We recently visited Nashville, and strategized ways to eat this soup four times in three days. Since returning to Texas, I've found myself dreamily drawing tiny caricatures of onions in the margins of my law books during class, mumbling ""onion bisque""! while I sleep, and rudely assuring the hostess at a recent dinner party that nothing she served me could possibly live up to the time I had onion bisque four times in three days in Nashville.Now that we've established that the soup was delightful, and included on the Hermitage's room service menu- I'll also note that we visited the Grill for a birthday celebration, and the staff went well out of their way to make us feel special. Ian was our waiter, and he was friendly, attentive, and provided excellent service. The bar next door had top-notch cocktails.

"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"My boss treated me to a belated birthday lunch at Capitol Grille and I absolutely loved it! The place is underground (sort of makes me think of The Sopranos), it's located under the Hermitage Hotel. The decor is ornate with lots of ugly crown molding and gold fixtures, with over sized chairs and tables, it's dimly lit and reminds me vaguely of the Bellagio in Vegas. They have black and white pictures of Nashville and Farm Glen Leven on the walls. That's the thing about Capitol Grille it's a farm to table spot (most of their menu is locally and regionally sourced) but you're eating it in a totally not Nashville environment! No hipster influence to be seen in this place, no trendy mason jars or cute bandana napkins or reclaimed wood tables, this is totally different and classy in a tacky sort of way but it's great! They have a business lunch special which in my opinion for the quality food and the quantity is an absurd deal! For $24 I got a seasonal tomato salad and a gigantic sandwich and crispy fries. I could only eat half the sandwich and a handful of french fries, which were freaking yummy by the way. I had The Club sandwich, think upscale diner food, you're favorite sandwich but done fancy, holy crap it was good. My boss had the Pastrami, which was also excellent. Also I sampled her gigantic Caesar salad plate and found the dressing to be delish!!!!!!!!Also the service was excellent, no complaints whatsoever! My next trip will definitely be a happy hour date with the boyfriend at the Oak Bar inside Captiol Grille, I believe they serve food and excellent drinks!

I'm a bit concerned this place may be too upper class for me. Our table was ready and the bench seat side was very comfortable and a perfect distance from the table. Our waiter (Dustin) made me feel at ease, very friendly guy with no stuffy attitudes. Extremely knowledgeable about the menu, ingredients, and how the food is prepared. I had the short rib. Cooked perfectly with great flavor and texture, with a surprisingly reasonable portion. My wife's lamb shank was fall off the bone delicious. Farm salad was fresh and even it was well presented.Onion bisque was pretty unique and amazing. For the dessert, some type of a white chocolate piece of art, don't remember what they called it. Unlike anything I've had, superlative dessert for grownups. Their ice creams are decadent. A great evening dining out.  Price to me was not out of line compared to other comparable restaurants. The house Cabernet, a Napa Rutherford, was thin out of the bottle but opened up wonderfully in the glass. Paired very well with the meat dishes we had.

"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"Spent the weekend in Nashville (from Philadelphia), and extensively researched each place we'd want to eat along the way.  Friday night was Capitol Grille, a spot we chose as much for the location inside the gorgeous Hermitage Hotel as anything.  Boy were we wrong to dismiss the food.First, the surroundings did not disappoint.  Partly since it was a bit of Southern charm this Jersey/Philly born fella and his lovely Istanbul-raised girlfriend aren't accustomed to.  But that's why we came here.  The kid in the seersucker suit, girls with their hair done up, the old guy in a bow-tie...you don't see that in Philly, even at the best restaurants.  So that was nice.  Yet comfortable.  We know how to dress and act according to our surroundings.But the food...how was the food?- Sweet Onion Bisque - The soup-loving girlfriend approved.  Poured at the table, as it should be.- Pork Belly - sticky, nice, but the beans it sat on were what stood out above all.- Truffled Mac & Cheese - as advertised.  A nice crunchy top, truffle-y, gooey goodness inside.  Yup.- Steak Frites - I hear they have their own cows here, and those cows produced a fine meat.  But I enjoyed the vegatable frites as much as the beef.  Great stuff here.Bonus to the whole thing is the attached Oak Bar which was filled with happy houring politicians and the like on a Friday evening.  Excellent people watching AND food eating.",Capitol Grille,6153457116,294 reviews,2013-04-22,"Philadelphia, PA",/biz/capitol-grille-nashville,5.0,138,"Washington, DC",Brian M.

What a wonderful response.I ordered the steak fritte (sp) with fries and because I had a huge gift certificate that expired I ordered the truffle mac n' cheese.

"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"I'm an unrepentant food snob.  Strike that, I'm a food bastard.I read reviews for chain restaurants, and just think that people that suffer that excrement are assholes.  One of the current presidents of our organization used to be an executive for Chilis; the stories would terrify you...  I recently bumped into a fellow who is a server at Capitol Grille, and he was simply a pretentious bastard.  Really made me think less of the place, because frankly I would assume I've had better experiences from an amuse-bouche at other places than that kid had ever had in his life.Ahem.  So anywho, the wife got a major promotion, so I decided to take her out for a nice lunch.This place hit on all cylinders from the beginning.  Fantastic, attentive service.  An older gentleman, cursing that I didn't remember his name - just a hoot of a server.Started with amazing bread, with fresh butter kissed by fleur de sel.  I'm not sure where it all went, but it wasn't on our table long.  The wife and I started off with their onion soup.It is an onion soup that truly retains the delightful characteristics of sweet onions, they pour that over a small brie sandwich and there is some Benton's bacon in the mix as well (the wife eschewed that, as she is a veg-head).  Pure heaven for both of us - truly hit the spot.I had a gin cocktail - truly hit the spot.  For the main course, I had a sandwich with their house-made pastrami - better than the home-made stuff I've had - absolutely exquisite!  The kraut and mustard were on point as well.  The wife had a salad that made her afternoon, and of course she snagged some of my frites.So, on the strength of an odd-houred lunch alone, I'd say this place can't fail, and again, kudos to our server!",Capitol Grille,6153457116,312 reviews,2012-10-11,"Nashville, TN",/biz/capitol-grille-nashville,5.0,138,"Washington, DC",Jason S.

"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"The Capitol Grille quietly makes its case as one of the country's best hotel restaurants. The restaurant is located within the gorgeous Hermitage Hotel in downtown Nashville. It's southern business casual versus formal. Jacket isn't necessary, but you don't exactly want to show up after a game of tackle football. Decor is refined, elegant, and comfortable. Service is friendly and straddling between informal and informal. It's fun though. You'll have lots of choices of appetizers, entrees, and sides. But it's variety doesn't compromise. It's seasonal. It's local In fact, many (if not all) items come from a nearby farm at Glen Leven. Dinner was exceptional. Gulf snapper (with brussel sprouts, celery root puree, crab burre monte) was delicious. The most savory dishes - the braised braised pork cheeks (with corn bread puree, cabbage, soft poached egg) and the venison (with collard greens, heirloom sweet potato, huckleberry shallot jus) - were absolute home-runs, with buttery and tender meats, juicy, bursting with flavor. We sampled several of the sides too. The truffle mac & cheese is truly excellent. The honey-glazed heirloom carrots and brussel sprouts and bacon were delicious too, but played second fiddle to that mac & cheese. Dessert was a dark chocolate with mint. Chances are you'll be full, bloated, and incapacitate by meal's end. After you leave the restaurant, take advantage of this state and relax in the lobby of The Hermitage Hotel. You may find staring into the stained glass ceiling therapeutic. Note: The Capitol Grille (with an O) is not related to The Capital Grille (with an A), which specializes in steaks, steaks, and more steaks.",Capitol Grille,6153457116,712 reviews,2012-10-18,"Atlanta, GA",/biz/capitol-grille-nashville,4.0,138,"Washington, DC",Jeff M.
"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"The only reason I am giving it two stars is because of the service.  The service was great.  The food was very disappointing.  The bread they served was tasteless.  My theory is if the bread is not good, get up and leave because the meal won't be much better.  We would have left but a couple next to us invited themselves to join us at our table so we were stuck.  We ordered the Calamari for an appetizer.  It was dry and tasteless. We ordered the trout as our main.  The presentation was horrible.    The trout looked like it was sitting under a heat lamp, the edges were all curled up.  It came with cauliflower... two pieces, really.  The plate looked empty and neither had flavor.  Not to mention lack of presentation. White fish and white cauliflower.  If I am going to spend $30 on an entree, it should be excellent.  Needless to say we felt ripped off and walked away hungry.  We will not be back.",Capitol Grille,6153457116,7 reviews,2014-12-14,"Atlanta, GA",/biz/capitol-grille-nashville,2.0,138,"Washington, DC",Susan D.

"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"We went here for dinner the night before my birthday. I really wanted to go mainly because it was inside a 100 year old hotel, The Hermitage, which I wanted to see since we couldn't stay there. I'd also read lots of good reviews about the food through various online blogs, Southern Living, yada, yada. I mentioned that we were going here to dinner to a few younger/college age kids we'd met earlier in the day and got a few blank stares (???) but maybe because it's not the kind of place a college kid on a budget would/should go? I made reservations through Open Table and we cabbed it over from our hotel. We arrived at the restaurant and the host(s) told us to have a drink at the Oak Bar while we waited on our table. Really cool spot. The bartender was super nice and we learned that the bar and restaurant were also 100 years old. Another bartenders told us to go upstairs after dinner and check out the hotel's memorabilia in the lobby and we were also told to stick our heads into the men's room to check out the awesome men's room which was voted the best men's room in the nation (this is a thing??) which was all decked out in art deco black/green (and had a shoe shine station). I had some kind of orange soda type of drink which was tasty and I continued through dinner. My husband had some kind of special bourbon which I smelled and tasted and agreed tasted slightly better than his usual choice of scotch (aka gasoline). Dinner was good. Our waiter was very nice. He suggested that we try the sweet onion bisque as a starter. The onion had been cooked in cream and butter for six hours, so how could it have been a mistake? There was a miniature grilled brie sandwich inside the soup. YUM. We also tried the oysters on the half shell, which you could order in as small or large quantities as you wanted. We each had the filet (good) and a different side, the Brussel sprouts (good but not as good as the Greenbrier) and my husband got their special, which was Carolina gold rice, smoked sausage and sweet peppers and made me wish I had ordered it once I had a bite. We were too stuffed for dessert but the menu looked amazing.",Capitol Grille,6153457116,233 reviews,2013-10-06,"Asbury Park, NJ",/biz/capitol-grille-nashville,4.0,138,"Washington, DC",Meg C.
"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"I so didn't want to give this restaurant only 3 stars because it is the restaurant located in Nashville's only 5 star hotel. I utlimately chose it because of its proximity to my late afternoon business meeting and a place that we could continue our discussions.I also chose it out of curiosity that it may be the only place in Nashville I had not eaten.We arrived and the service was perfect. We enjoyed a drink in the famous bar, transferred our tab to the table and prepared for a delicious meal. The server presented the specials and described the menu which sounded great. I ordered the clams starter and the salmon special for my dinner entree. The clams were great. The dish had a unique flavor and taste and I ate every bite.  After about an hour, I received my dinner entree. It was an overcooked salmon filet on top of a spoon full of corn. Although, I intended to discreetly inform my server about it, he never returned to the table, so I just ate it.Some in my party ordered desert and I overheard they were somewhat dissappointed in the grilled peaches and ice cream. Again, another hour went by while I was waiting on the check. I can handle one or the other, but mediocre service and so-so food I cannot tolerate. So other than the food and wait staff, I give the valet, host and bar a perfect 5 stars.

All hot items are served in a cast iron dish. It makes for great presentation and keeps the steak hot but it makes it extremely hard to cut a steak without burning yourself.All in all, it was a great meal.

"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"Have you ever dated someone, long after you knew that they were not ""the one?""The Capitol Grille is that someone.She looks great. Classy and a little different. She even smells good. She's very nice when you first meet, a top notch hostess (I am talking about the restaurant).But ever so slowly, things start to fall apart. First, she's noisy. The restaurant is all stone and beautiful concrete arches with no walls between tables, so the acoustics are such that you can hear every single conversation, at every single table.It's just a quirk, you tell yourself. No big deal. You continue to see each other.The menu is somewhat limited. One page. Your special someone has no depth. 12:30pm on Saturday and fully half the menu is breakfast. Lunch was limited to about 3 choices.Another quirk. It's ok, your special someplace/someone doesn't have to be that deep. Just look at the beauty! Besides, she just might do these few things very well.The Sweet onion bisque comes with a brie grilled cheese. But it's the size of a large crouton. The Tennessee Stack (a double cheeseburger) was perfectly medium and moist on 1/2 the patty, but well done and dry on the second half. If you're still star struck by her beauty, you can overlook these little inconsistencies. But by now, you know this isn't the greatest, but you will stick around for more fun.As for drinks, this classic Tennessee establishment doesn't have sweet tea. No sweet tea- in the south? Then I had to use the restroom. I enter to find a tour group in the restroom. Yep 6 members of the opposite sex learning about the grand history - OF THE RESTROOM!OK, I learned some interesting stuff, and the restroom was beautiful as well, but for crying-out-loud, let a brother pee!Suddenly you realize that your special someone is bat-shit-crazy. You're a little concerned that if you try to leave, they just might stab you.And stab you, they do.

They were incredible -- I even ask for more of the brioche!We were told by some friends to get the sweet onion bisque, or the smoked trout, but they were offering oysters -- which I just can't pass up.

"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"The husband and I went to Capitol Grille because we had a Groupon that needed to be used. I was anticipating a stuffy, hoity-toity establishment with mediocre food, and that was in no way what we got.Even though I'm a feminist, I like being treated with respect - doors opened, chairs pulled out, and greeted by name, which is what happened at Capitol Grille. Very nice and classy touches by everyone from the maitre d' to our server. We started off in the Oak Bar for some cocktails, but as soon as they came, our table was ready. It would've been nice to hang out there for a while.Our table was in the corner of the large room - perfect for watching everyone come and go, but private enough that we could have an intimate conversation. The server was knowledgable about the menu and readily answered questions and provided us with information about the food and a few recommendations.We each started out with the Vidalia Onion Bisque, which was so creamy and amazing. The presentation was nice too. My husband ordered the venison, and I ordered the bollito misto. Both of our entrees were superb. The dijon spaetzle that came with my entree were the perfect balance of texture and spiciness and provided a great bed for the flavorful meat.We ended with the chocolate hazelnut cobbler with buttermilk ice cream. It was probably my least favorite part of the meal, but after what came before it, that was not a surprise. The buttermilk ice cream was pleasntly tangy and a nice compliment to the sweet, gooey cobbler.It was not a cheap meal, but the service and atmosphere and quality of the food was worth it.

"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"My friend recommended the Hermitage as a ""must see"" on my weekend away in Nashville. Upon checking out the Capitol Grille's menu online, I felt hesitant to spend our Saturday evening here for dinner (we were only in Nashville for a weekend). I'm a vegetarian and they only offered one meatless entrée. Just one. What if the ""winter vegetable entrée"" for $25 sucked? There was no description on the menu, so my husband called to inquire about it. The woman who answered the phone didn't sell him on the food at all. She said the veggie entrée was just that -- a plate of steamed veggies. Doesn't sound too exciting, eh? It gets better. We decide to go there for afternoon tea instead (5 stars all the way!). As we were waiting for our table, we talked to a wonderful hostess about our dinner dilemma - is this place worth coming to for a plate of steamed veggies? She said absolutely yes because the truffle mac n cheese alone is OUT OF THIS WORLD! She then told us that the head chef has a staff meeting at 4pm each day to discuss dinner and that she would mention that a vegetarian would be dining with them that evening to see if he could make me something special, sans mushrooms. Fantastic! We came back that night and had one of the best meals of our lives. Complimentary salmon sprinkled with a candied ginger - melt in your mouth amazing! My hubby got the prime cap of beef. I got a wonderful vegetable plate with a side of fried green tomatoes and the best truffle mac n cheese of my life (see photo of my plate before I dived in). We were purring over how delicious the food was. Mmmmm after mmmmmm after mmmmmmmm. DELICIOUS! Needless to say, the decor was absolutely stunning.

"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"Let me preface that I am reviewing Capitol Grille not the Oak Bar. I have not yet visited the bar, although I hear its great.I have had the pleasure of dining here on lunch meetings, twice so far with a vendor and my Boss when he flies in from Dallas. The three of us always seem to agree that this is the place to go when he is in town. My Vendor, a native Nashvillian recommended the place and we have been smitten ever since the first visit. The service is A+, friendly and professional valet, friendly and welcoming Hostess and the waiters/ waitresses always a pleasure. The food is served promptly - I read other reviews which said otherwise, I am sad to hear that and wonder if it had to do with it just being a ""bad day""? I have had the Ceasar salad - delicious. Hanger Steak Salad - steak cooked to perfection. We tried several other things, all were delicious and the perfect temp. The atmosphere is typical of this level of pricing - however, I am not your typical ""business woman"" with a suit and even with my business casual attire - I wasn't treated any differently by the staff. Great food, great experience definitely a great place for a nice dinner, business lunch, special occassion or evening out before a show or downtown event.

"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"Just about the best thing about Capitol Grille is the Art Deco room. There is no question the ambiance is 5-star quality. Should you do more than just take in the atmosphere, though, I think you will find that Capitol Grille does not quite live up to expectation. To put it simply: the food is good but way way overpriced for what you are getting. I ordered a hanger steak and it was cooked to a beautiful medium rare. Unfortunately it was also drenched, inexplicably with butter and served without a single side. Though we bit the bullet and ordered sides separately, we sort of wished we hadn't. If you are going to charge $8 for a side of brussel sprouts they better be good. These weren't even close to good. Though our waiter said this was his favorite side dish, the brussel sprouts we received were barely cooked (they had been sauteed in butter) with some of them sprouts still raw. Though the menu says the dish is brussel sprouts with walnuts, it would be more accurate to say 'walnut dust' since the walnuts were, in powder form, sprinkled on top of the dish. It was just not good. The best part of the meal was definitely our desert--the only dish at the table (which included the rabbit, the duck, brussel sprouts, onion soup, and my hangar steak) that I would have happily paid for again. The Tennessee Cake was delicious.

"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"When Nashville was building its extraordinary downtown public library, there was a good slogan/bumper sticker making the rounds: ""A city with a great library is a great city.""* That eloquent sentence is now engraved in the grand reading room of said library. (*Penned, btw, by Nashvillian John Denson.)But this is a review of a bar. So, my riff off that fine sentence would be: ""A city with a great hotel bar is a great city.""The Oak Bar at the Hermitage is a great hotel bar. Because a great hotel bar is one the locals love... Native New Yorkers love the Algonquin. You'll find a lot of Windy City residents at the Drake. And the Round Robin bar at the Willard in D.C. is more local than tourist.I recently visited the Oak Bar (after a bit of a hiatus) since it was the appointed spot to celebrate a friend's birthday. I'd always liked it, but I had sort of forgotten about it. My recent visit took care of that memory loss.A low-key classic bar that often ""features"" its fair share of legislators (the state capitol's just a stone's throw away) and wheeler-dealers, the Oak Bar proved it was equally and graciously at-home with 30-some Nashville music, fashion,  hipster types at the birthday celebration of my lovely friend. Neither multiple drink and snack orders, nor loud laughter and the requisite birthday cake phased the Oak Bar's amazing staff in the slightest. They rolled with it all--while still paying attention to the other customers who probably wondered what they'd wandered into. And, at the end of the night, all those nutty ""separate checks"" were handled with grace and precision.

"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"The Capitol Grille is a truly unique southern fine dining experience.   The dining room has the atmosphere of any modern upscale fine dining establishment, but the menu items are delightfully surprising takes on classic ingredients of southern cuisine.First course for both my girlfriend and myself was the Vidalia Onion Bisque.  This was a soup that I only wish they had a entree-sized portion, because I could have easily eaten it as it's own meal.  The soup itself is poured over a small amount of diced bacon and fresh chives, with a tiny grilled brie sandwich.  The soup was fantastic by itself.  The lightly sweet flavor of caramelized onions and the velvety smoothness of the soup is alone enough reason to order it.  I almost thought it a shame to interrupt it with the chives and bacon, but I did love how the saltiness of the bacon and the taste of fresh chives took the flavor of the soup to yet another level.I got the smoked pork chops with fried grits and bourbon braised greens.  My girlfriend ordered what was called ""Bollito Misto"", which had venison, pork belly , and  two different sausages that I can't remember the names of at the moment, served over dijon spatzle and cheddar cauliflower.I can't speak for the Bollito Misto dish, but the smoked pork chop was great.  I'm not a fan of grits, personally, but the bourbon-braised collard greens went great with the pork chop, and there was just a little bit of peach jam to give a little bit of sweetness to the chop.Dessert was Creme Brulee for me, though it tasted strongly of fresh vanilla, I like creme brulee be warm, however, I'm not going to hold personal taste against the restaurant just because the way I like it differs from how the dessert is traditionally served.My girlfriend had a scoop of pineapple-mint sorbet.  The thing a lot of restaurants make the mistake of doing with their homemade sorbets, ice creams, etc. is making them sweet to the point of being cloying, and I'm happy to say that this was not the case with this sorbet.  The pineapple was far and away the most prominent flavor, with only a light aftertaste of mint, which was exactly what we were hoping for.Let me also say that this is an upscale establishment.  Cost here is a reflection of quality, not quantity, and while you get a perfectly appropriate amount of food, the food is so good that it's practically a bargain when you consider the soup was $8 and the entrees were between $28-$32.There are a LOT of amazing restaurants in Nashville, and Capitol Grille is one of them.  I won't be going to Capitol Grille for a while, because there's so many other good ones I like going to, but needless to say, it will become a part of my rotation from now on.",Capitol Grille,6153457116,29 reviews,2010-10-14,"Columbus, OH",/biz/capitol-grille-nashville,5.0,138,"Washington, DC",Justin W.
"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and chose to eat here on a Friday night. Though the food was wildly uneven, the setting is wonderfully elegant yet casual, and the service was absolutely superb. My wife started with a house specialty, the sweet onion bisque. This was sublime...wonderfully smooth and creamy with hints of sweetness offset by tiny yet crunchy bites of smoky bacon. This was only marred by an uninspired ""Brie sandwich""...a crouton-sized bite which would have added wonderful flavor and texture if it had been toasted (as I suspect it should have been) but was instead tossed carelessly into the soup as a cold lump. I had the fried oysters with smoked hollandaise and Anson Mills dirty rice and tomato butter. This was not a successful dish. If I hadn't just looked up the menu, I wouldn't have remembered any of the components...all I remember was that the oysters were small, not particularly plump, and crusted with cornmeal that resulted in something akin to chewing on little pebbles. For my entree, I had one of the specials, a roasted black cod with sunchoke puree and beet salad. It was a work of art and sure looked beautiful. However, I was not a fan of the flavors. The cod looked beautiful, a medalion punched out of a filet, which was gorgeously caramelized on top. However, the kitchen chose to only brown the one side before roasting it in the oven. This was a mistake since it was a piece of fish that sat over 3 inches tall. Not surprisingly, the middle of it was still raw (not rare). There was only a tiny smudge of the sunchoke puree, but my least favorite component was the beet salad. The beets were still raw and shave thin, but I am just not a fan. For only the second time in my life, I had to return the entree to the kitchen. The waiter and hostess were incredible at this point...they were so apologetic and kept offering to comp us drinks for our inonvenience. This was entirely unnecesary as I could readily understand why it happened and wasn't upset by it at all. I did ask for a different entree however, the hanger steak. This arrived promptly at the desired doneness, and while it wasn't anything special, it was OK. The sides (a la carte of course) were also just OK...a truffled mac and cheese was particularly disappointing. It tasted of penne pasta swimming in cream and drowned by truffle oil. Where was the cheese? A pureed roasted pumpkin was serviceable, as were the mashed potatoes. My wife just ordered the broiled scallops, and that's what she got. Five sea scallops which were beautifully caramelized on top, swimming in butter. How could you go wrong with that? In any case, though we turned down their kind offer of drinks, we finally relented to their offer of desert on the house. Since we were quite full, we split the lemon cake. Now that was something! The cake was so incredibly moist and flavorful, the relatively tasteless whipped cream frosting was extraneous.In any case, though the food was uneven and quite expensive (over $200 for the two of us with one drink each), the service was really above and beyond.

We put in our first course and waited for confirmation on what was available from the menu. That never came and the food only came after we complained to the manager. She apologized profusely but they also then they proceeded to get the main course meal wrong.

"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"My fiancee and I ate dinner here on Tuesday, July 12th to celebrate her birthday. I have lived in Nashville for nearly all of my life but had never eaten at Capitol Grille despite hearing so many good things about it. I decided to surprise my fiancee by making reservations a little over two weeks ago on Opentable. I guess the primary reason I have never been there is because it is located in the Hermitage Hotel and I've rarely spent the night at a hotel in the city where I live.The meal itself was quite excellent with only one minor issue. We arrived promptly at our reservation time of 7 pm and were immediately seated. The restaurant wasn't full. I would say it was about 80% occupied. I ordered a Summer Salad ($8) for my first course while my fiancee ordered the Chicken Livers ($11). I enjoyed my salad. I thought it was a little earthy tasting but it is locally grown and fresh. I believe most if not all of the ingredients are grown locally on a nearby farm which is something I always enjoy supporting. My fiancee enjoyed her Chicken Livers but did comment that her dish was a little messy due to the bread crumbs from the pate spread. It was one of the few times her side of the table was messier than mine! For our main course I ordered the Lamb Loin ($32). The lamb is served with cherries, roasted garlic, and Italian Roma beans. It was very delicious. I also ordered the Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes ($7) as a side dish. They were delicious as well. My fiancee ordered the Pork Chop ($28) as her main dish. She enjoyed her dish too. I even managed to taste a couple bites and found her pork chop to be more tasty than my lamb. This is mainly a personal preference issue and not a quality issue with the lamb. I had decided to go with something that I normally wouldn't have as a home cooked meal. One interesting note regarding the service of our main course. We were still eating our first course dishes when the servers including our main server James brought out our our main course dishes. This is normally a no no in a fine dining establishments. He apologized and offered to take them back but we said it was OK. We would rather eat them immediately than have them go back under a heating lamp or some other warming device. Toward the end of our meal our server apologized again and offered us each a free desert which we gladly accepted. I cannot remember the exact name of my desert. I don't see where the desert menu is posted online (the breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus are all posted). It was a brownie prepared with Jack Daniels. The complimentary desert wasn't necessary as I thought serving the main course a little too early was only a minor inconvience but the apology and the attempt to compensate for this miscue were appreciated. The service that accompanied our meal was terrific as we expected it would be. Our main server James was nice and knowledgable. I liked the fact he knew my name (from the reservation). This is common in nice restaurants but I still like it. Our water glasses were constantly being filled up and the main hostess came by and asked how we were doing at least twice. We valet parked our car which is pretty convenient considering the location of the restaurant downtown on 6th   Avenue North. There are a couple free options to park two or three blocks away but valet parking is free for the first two hours. We were actually there almost 2.5 hours but there was no charge.  In all I was quite impressed with our dining experience at Capitol Grille. If you haven't eaten here before I would recommend it. It is obviously more expensive (prices are listed on their menus posted online) than a chain or second tier restaurant but not really that much more and certainly well worth it.

"231 6th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",3.5,"oak bar review.upscale bar that doesn't present itself in a stuffy manner by any means. if you're coming by to have a drink and sneak out, go downstairs from the front entrance (as though you're going to the bathroom) and the entrance will be on the left. it was busy this saturday evening, we were there at around 7pm. walked up to the bar, then noticed there was an empty table so we seated ourselves. it didn't take very long at all for our server to tend to us: manhattan (up) and a dark + stormy.my manhattan was very good, the whiskey made its presence known but it was never overbearing. friend had the dark and stormy, and i remember hearing the server mention they don't have dark rum, so they used something else. we were the most dressed down people in the bar (i'm no stranger to that scenario, lol), but i didn't feel like i was out of place. parking is validated for the first two hours if you're just going to the bar or restaurant, though the valet operation this day was swamped.looking forward to coming here with a couple other friends for a couple nice drinks to start the night off.eric b",Capitol Grille,6153457116,146 reviews,2011-06-27,"Nashville, TN",/biz/capitol-grille-nashville,3.0,138,"Washington, DC",Eric B.

All three were awesome:Cream of onion soup was worth the trip alone. Sweet Vidalia onions slow simmered in butter and then finished by blending with cream. Rich, sweet and oh so oniony good. Been on the menu forever.I tried the new gazpacho, which was spicy and refreshing on a muggy day. It had been finished with herbs, spice, EVO, balsamic and crunchy radishes. Summer in a bowl!We all ordered the same entree, a house smoked trout filet (smoked a la minute) with watercress salad and crispy sun chokes, and I was glad that I didn't have to share. All three plates were wiped clean.The menu and cuisine prominently feature local products, but the Hermitage is taking it to the next level.

The waiters seemed extremely annoyed once our final decision was made to dine in the Capitol Grille.

Then there was the all barley warm tasteless dressing turned out of a cup measure made for the masses I guess. Don't let me forget the 2inch x 2 inch tiny plate of pale pinkish cranberry sauce that had about one tablespoon of sauce on it that didn't have any taste.     Since they only had so many tables for the night and I am sure that they have the facilities (ovens) to roast a few birds I cannot believe they turned this dinner out!!  It cost for two of us over $170.00 with tip and two glasses of wine.  We went home hungry.  Note to the dessert chef ; the white Mousse was actually very good.",Capitol Grille,6153457116,8 reviews,2011-11-27,"West Hollywood, CA",/biz/capitol-grille-nashville,1.0,138,"Washington, DC",Jan W.

Also, he asked us if we wanted bread, we said yes, then waited a bit too long for it. and then we just started nibbling at the bread when our entrees arrived. My meal, the Ashley (?) Farms chicken, was salty. It came with a spinach/corn/pork fatback sautee or scramble that looked delicious, but was rendered almost inedible by the overly salty fatback. The chicken was juicy and tender, but it was broiled in a spice rub that had an overly high proportion of salt. The chef really goes overboard with the salty food.

"4530 HardIng RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Okay, so the food here isn't really worthy of 5 stars - more of a 4 star for just the food, but this really has become one of my go-to places in Nashville, for one, because I love sushi, and two because they have a really vast and interesting menu.  I can always come here and get something new.  Also, they always have toro and uni, which is very hit or miss at other places.Another one of my favorite things about this place is that when I order nigiri when they are busy, I usually have to wait a little longer to get it for the best of reasons - they only let their most experienced chef slice the nigiri, and I don't think it's because the others are not capable, they just want the master chef cutting it, and I appreciate that, especially when forking out money for toro, and it always comes the same way every time.  I've always felt that nigiri needs to drape over the rice and be laying flat on the plate at both ends.  That's just the size nigiri should be, and it always is like that here.Don't neglect their specials!  I ordered the (cooked) yellowtail collar, and not only was it very good, but the portion was quite large.  I've ordered the bibimbap, which was quite good as well, but really was slightly overcooked as the hot bowl crisped up the rice too much, and yes I stirred it right away.  I had a couple issues with their bulgogi.  Was it good?  Yes.  It wasn't even close to the best I've had (especially since Korea), but they don't serve it with lettuce to wrap it up!?!  In any case, I really like this place now.  I forgot to mention that you can also get in and out of here on the cheap if you're just have a craving.Cheap:  I highly recommend a Jack's Roll if you want that fried fish, eel and cream cheese taste.  I get it every time I go.  Also, the lunch boxes are awesome, and come with their delicious salad and onion soup.Expensive:  Toro, of course.  Lots and lots of Toro.  Their salmon is always very, very good as well.  I tried the Kagero style steak for $26 one time, and it's very good, but it's no bargain, and I'd argue not worth it.  Honestly, the Filet mignon lunch is better for half the price.",Ninki,6153860072,221 reviews,2015-06-17,"Nashville, TN",/biz/ninki-nashville,4.0,77,"Washington, DC",Andy B.

There's also a hibachi option, but I've only come for sushi, so I can't speak on it. Another thing I love about Ninki are their drinks. The lemon drop cocktail is freaking delicious and their dark and stormy drinks are pret-ty strong.",Ninki,6153860072,462 reviews,2015-08-24,"Denver, CO",/biz/ninki-nashville,5.0,77,"Washington, DC",Zeb M.

I'm a very picky sushi eater (I have eaten sushi all over the country) and I was very pleased with their quality. I ordered the salmon nigiri, Philadelphia roll & Titan roll. I was impressed!  My daughter ordered the kids chicken/rice and loved it!  It also came with vegetables.  My husband had the steak teriyaki and all I observed was an empty plate.

"4530 HardIng RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Ninki is one of the few places in Nashville that doesn't make me grimace when it's picked for sushi night. The atmosphere is clean and relaxed and service is always friendly but leans towards the slower side. The menu has plenty of options at reasonable prices for the quality. They have a ""half-off"" sushi menu but it's always that price so it's really just the ""value"" menu. I find the rolls on that menu are a little more on the plain/smaller side than the regular menu but still pretty decent, especially for how inexpensive they are. I've always enjoyed everything I've ordered off of the regular menu and I've never left here disappointed. Most sushi places in Nashville are either low quality or overpriced for decent quality.

"4530 HardIng RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"My wife had to spend Valentine's weekend on call, so we didn't want to do anything super fancy just in case she had to run to work unexpectedly. Ninki sounded great, and it's also pretty close to her job (just in case).I wish Ninki had taken the time to renew their GoDaddy subscription so I could check out the website. It took me about 20 minutes of Googling to track down a menu. I think the menu I did find was out of date though, judging by some of the more recent Yelp reviews.When we walked in, the hostess told us it was only about a 15-20 minute wait without a reservation, which I thought wasn't bad at all for a Saturday night Valentine's Day. The poor little hostess girls were kind of unorganized and seemed completely overwhelmed by the task set before them. I'm assuming they don't often deal with an extremely busy dinner service. After waiting 20 minutes, we asked how much longer it would be, but they said they really didn't know. That's strange because I had just heard one of the hostesses tell someone it would be a 45-minute wait for a table. There are also apparently different wait times depending on whether you want to sit at a table, the sushi bar, or the hibachi grill. Trouble is, they don't always ask which seating type you want. Do they just guess and make up times as they go? We didn't want to press our luck any further, so we ended up just sitting at the sushi bar. From what I'm told, Ninki used to have a huge selection of cheap half-price sushi, but sadly no more. Although there are still a few $3-$4 rolls on the menu, the majority of their rolls are somewhere in the $6-$10 range, with a few closer to $15. Price wasn't really an obstacle since it was Valentine's Day, but still. There were too many delicious things to choose from. We each picked two. My wife selected the Jack's Roll (fried halibut with avocado and cream cheese) and the TN Roll (deep fried roll with shrimp, avocado, crab, and roe). I decided to be a little adventurous and try the Texas Roll (spicy crab, deep fried Japanese pepper, and avocado topped with seared NY steak and eel sauce) and the Hawaiian Roll (tempura shrimp, asparagus, and cream cheese topped with avocado, mango, and nuts.Everything we had was delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed the fried halibut in the Jack's Roll, and the cream cheese complimented it quite nicely. My wife has a fondness for fried sushi, hence the TN Roll. It was crunchy and packed with flavor. The Hawaiian roll was very good, although the mango didn't stand out as much as I expected. The highlight of our dinner was the Texas Roll, which comes out flaming like the sushi version of Crepes Suzette. The seared beef added an interesting savoriness to the sushi, and dipping it in spicy mayo made things even better. Despite the trouble at the hostess stand, we had a really friendly waiter who was quick and gave us great service. He and the food made up for whatever was going on up front. I'm sure we'll be back to Ninki, though probably on a weekday instead.",Ninki,6153860072,541 reviews,2015-02-15,"Nashville, TN",/biz/ninki-nashville,4.0,77,"Washington, DC",Jared K.

"4530 HardIng RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"As a Ninki lunch regular who has been coming to this establishment weekly, I feel it is time to inform the masses of what I've learned. Please note, I am not a huge fan of dinner here; the 4 stars I am awarding for *Lunch* only and here is why...1. $7-8 for Hibachi during lunch served with a meat, vegetables, fried rice, a salad, and soup. That is ridiculously cheap. I seriously think they are losing money on this transaction. (Just don't tell them that).2. Half price eat-in sushi. While the original price is moderately inflated, the half off discount makes the a price of a role very reasonable/economical. If you can't fill up on hibachi alone, throw a roll or two on as well.3. Refillable soda. This is one of the few Asian restaurants were you aren't served a stupid can of soda that you have to pay individually for. You can have all the diet Coke you want here. Thank god. 4. There is always a ton of convenient parking. (No making loops around midtown looking for that one space on a side street that everyone else also glanced over.)Please note the cons of Ninki:1. Service is generally slow. If you're in a rush, don't chance it and come here. I think this is especially true at the hibachi tables. While there yesterday, I am pretty sure there was a 15 minute period where they forgot I was there. No harm because I wasn't in a hurry to get my bill.2. Windowless dining room. I'm a fan of restaurants with windows (personal preference) so coming here on a nice weekend afternoon hurts my soul a little bit. Hate sunshine and good views? Then this should always be your go-to spot.3. Dinner prices are fine. Not cheap, not overly expensive.

"4530 HardIng RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Before heading to Ninki, I read all the mixed reviews- so I was a little nervous. However, I was craving sushi and the 50% off of selected sushi rolls seemed too good to turn down, especially on this part of town where the pickins for good Asian cuisine are slim. When we walked inside, a friendly host greeted us. The restaurant was more spacious than I expected. Our server was also very attentive and enthusiastic about the restaurant. She talked it up so much I thought maybe she was the owner! I really appreciated her recommendations too. I think she was spot on for what I was looking for. When the food came out, it was displayed well. The sushi rolls were the perfect combination of fresh fish and rice! It was obvious the sushi was fresh- it melted in your mouth!  I still can't get over the 50% off sushi menu that is offered all day everyday. Plus, the lunch menu looked like it had some great prices-- from bento boxes and hibachi. Those lunch prices are surprisingly also offered everyday of the week-- which is rare to find. Other restaurants typically only offer their lunch specials Monday through Friday. With excellent prices, service, and food-- I can't see why Ninki shouldn't get 5 stars!

(And you don't have to order the cheap hot sake like I did.  ALL sake tonight was $1.)The rolls and nigiri I had were good.   Thankfully they were 50% off, because I agree with other reviews that the menu does seem expensive.  They were ""specialty"" rolls I ordered, I realize, but still - $14 and $9 for a roll.   Seems like a lot. The variety is interesting.  There are many rolls, but commonly found things like spicy tuna or just salmon are missing.  However, cream cheese and/or avocado are very prevalent on the menu.  I asked if the ""Fire"" rolls were spicy.  They are entitled ""Fire"" rolls because they actually come ON FIRE.  Yes, lit on fire.  This is a cool presentation, with the only downside being that it halfway cooks some of the raw fish!I'd go to Ninki if you're in the area.",Ninki,6153860072,295 reviews,2011-11-06,"Nashville, TN",/biz/ninki-nashville,3.0,77,"Washington, DC",Rachel S.

Everything from the 4 pieces of sushi to the salad, miso soup, tempura, and rice were excellent. The portions were just right but the standout was the miso soup! You may not think that miso is very exciting but I appreciated the big chunks of shitake mushrooms and robust flavor. Yum in the tum. Don't judge this book by it's cover either. From the exterior, Ninki is nestled inside a dated strip mall but when you walk through the doors, it is a spacious and dark place to relax and enjoy tasty but affordable Asian cuisine.

"4530 HardIng RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"With the amount of Japanese restaurants that are in Nashville, most are mediocre to... bleh with a few hidden gems.  This place is unfortunately not one of the latter.  There kitchen serves not only sushi, but also serves bento boxes and teppanyaki.  I came here three times and based on those experiences, I would probably say that if you want food to arrive on a timely fashion, make sure you order their ""hibachi"" and that the rest of your table does so too.Let's start with the best thing that they do well: The NINKI bento boxes during the lunch special is extremely well priced for what they give you and the kitchen actually cooks up a pretty delicious (albeit thin) tonkatsu and tempura.  My only complaint is that you have to get fried rice with the dish.  The onion soup is actually not bad.The next best thing? The teppanyaki that they call ""hibachi"".  It's nothing like a Benihana since they aren't as fun to watch.  With the hibachi, you get the meat of your choice (beef, chicken, salmon, and shrimp and you can choose how well done you want the beef).  I ordered the beef and even though they cooked it to medium rare as I had ordered, the beef they serve though is unfortunately not of great quality.  On my first visit with my group, we ordered different items and for those of us that didn't order the teppanyaki, we waited so long that our friends who did had already finished eating.  Our waitress though was quite helpful and did the best she could to keep us complacent.  On our second visit, we all ordered hibachi and this worked out much better.I haven't had their sushi so that judgement is reserved for another visit.Price: 4Food: 3Service: 4",Ninki,6153860072,75 reviews,2013-05-23,"San Francisco, CA",/biz/ninki-nashville,3.0,77,"Washington, DC",Ray L.

I waited patiently for a while - until the server started handing out individual checks and I STILL hadn't recieved my meal.

"4530 HardIng RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Here's my quick and dry review of this place, which I USED to frequent about once per week.I rated 4 out of 5, based on my experiences with other sushi restaurants in Nashville, because it is unfair to compare to some of the other sushi restaurants I've been to while living in Manhanttan, NY. I usually rate sushi based on three criteria. Rice, Fish, and Presentation.Here, the sushi rice is of good consistency and taste. Not too dry, not too mushy. Good overall texture. Not too sweet or too much vinegar, but seasoned right for my palate.Here, the fish is always consistent. Fresh and vibrant in color. The raw scallop is so-so.  Sea urchin is good. Occasionally, they have specialty fish like Toro. The nigiri fish is sliced appropriately, in terms of size and thickness. Acceptable fish to rice ratio, but could be more delicate.Here, the presentation is average. I'm not expecting much, particularly since the prices are average. Again, not delicate but acceptable.As others mentioned, the location (in a strip mall) is quite deceiving. I would have skipped this place had I not stumbled upon it by accident. The interior is ok decorated with appropriate lighting. If it's busy, it can get a bit noisy inside due to the high ceilings and large interior space. Service is average, friendly. Sometimes a bit slow when busy, but expected. Sometimes when it's busy, they look clueless. They have sake, wine and specialty drinks, but I cannot comment on this since I get water.I love raw fish and shellfish. I love toro, hamchi and mirugai. Sadly for me, people in Nashville tend to favor the more common fish so this place doesn't carry the more selective fishes/shellfish on a regular basis. Ninki sometimes sells the fatty salmon skin, which I HIGHLY recommend. I typically order the nigiri or the chirashi here because ANY specialty rolls tend to mask the flavor of the rice and fish. I realize this may be desirable for some, but I prefer the raw taste. I eat all my raw seafood without any garnish - no cocktail sauce, lemon, nothing. Only wasabi and soy sauce. Sometimes, without it too. If I'm on a budget that day, I'll stick to ordering their maki rolls since it's always 50% off for dine-in customers. The hibachi is so-so.  Not my favorite, but I come here for the sushi.Ok, so maybe this wasn't a quick review. Too bad we can't do a powerpoint presentation, complete with animation. I'll end by saying this...the place is Japanese owned and operated. Why is this important? Because it is.",Ninki,6153860072,52 reviews,2012-08-06,"Annapolis, MD",/biz/ninki-nashville,4.0,77,"Washington, DC",Ben F.

I did not even know that they have hibachi but I'm glad they did because a friend was not that into sushi (baffle my mind I know). Service was top notch. The Hibachi chef was very personable, nothing too flashy but with a drink in hand, the experience was great. I had the gyoza for appetizers, mahi mahi entree, and wasabi margarita to drink. The gyoza was good, typical but good. The mahi mahi was cooked well, I had it taken off the grill before it was overcooked, gotta be careful with fish. I also tried my friend's calamari steak. It was pretty awesome I may have to get that next time. The wasabi margarita was not overpowering with just a hint of wasabi at the end. I was definitely pleasantly surprised.The sushi menu was pretty extensive and not too pricey either. I ordered the Pretty Woman Roll (shrimp tempura on the inside with raw tuna on the outside). It was so tasty. My friend had the Volcano roll which came out on fire. A+++ for presentation.I will definitely come back especially on Feb 27, 2012 since it's their 1 yr anniversary so 50% off sushi roll baby.

The location is very nice, but as other reviewers have said, it's quite large and feels a bit empty. For us, Service was prompt and friendly. We even had a table just to ourselves.

For dinner I had the Hibachi Salmon which was really good. I've never been to another Teppanyaki place that offered this so it was a pleasant surprise.

"4530 HardIng RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Ninki has renewed my faith in Japanese food in Nashville.  I am a card carrying Japanese Food Snob.  I lived in Japan for three years, my wife is Japanese, I cook and eat Japanese food all the time.  Nashville has never had a Japanese restaurant that really stood up to my unreasonable expectations.  Until now, until Ninki.  I went to the Grand Opening event that was unfortunately scheduled on May 5th.  If you speak Spanish or just like an excuse to drink and eat chips and salsa you understand why that might be a challenge for a Japanese restaurant.  Nonetheless the meal and the evening were fantastic.Ninki is located in the shopping center next to the Belle Mead Kroger on West End.  From the outside it is rather unassuming and will take a while for the locals to catch on to.  Inside it is very sleek and elegant.  There are two separate dining areas since they offer both Hibachi and a more traditional sushi and Japanese food menu.  Overall I found the atmosphere to be very appealing place to spend time and enjoy a meal.  The menu is broad and covers a lot of ground.  I did not have the Hibachi so I cannot review that part of the restaurant. They have a full sushi menu and a great selection of unique Japanese specialties.  I love a good hibachi, but with as good as the rest of the menu is I don't know if I will ever make it to the Ninki hibachi tables.  If I had one recommendation for the menu at Ninki it would be to go exploring.  They offer multiple dishes that are unique and definitely not offered anywhere else in Nashville or at almost any Japanese restaurant that I have been to in the US.  Our group was fortunate enough to be seated with some friends of the chef so we got to sample most of the specialties on the menu.  All of them were excellent and made me wish I had a bigger stomach.  A quick recap of the meal is as follows:Salmon Ceviche Salad with shaved parmigiana and a wonderful dressing;  Hon Maguro Tuna, the real deal and the best sushi I have had in Nashville;  Duck Breast served Jibu-ni style which apparently means with a delicate mushroom sauce and grilled scallions, fantasic;  Black Cod baked with vegetables in a paper wrapper which might have been the single best piece of fish I have ever had, moist and unbelievably full of flavor;  Ribeye steak cooked on a ripping hot stone and flambed with cognac;  Creme Brule;  French Wine; Beer ; Lobster roll Sushi; Chocolate Cake.  Honestly it is a miracle I was able to get up, but everything was perfectly sized and impossible to resist.  Ninki left me completed satisfied and more than a little impressed.  It is not a cheap place to eat, but it is worth every penny and then some.  If you are a traditionalist the sushi is excellent and will definitely not disappoint.  If you want to experiment then there is a wealth of great food waiting to be discovered.  Explore the menu at Ninki.  There are things there that cannot be had anywhere else in Nashville.",Ninki,6153860072,214 reviews,2011-05-05,"Nashville, TN",/biz/ninki-nashville,5.0,77,"Washington, DC",Ian R.
"4530 HardIng RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"I was not impressed. Prices are high and why have a lobster tank if it's empty? Too many gimmick rolls on the menu. If there are no live lobsters in the lobster tank, where are they getting lobsters for their fancy raw lobster roll? I'm guessing way dead frozen ones in the back. And if that's true, I certainly wouldn't want to eat it. I ordered some fried oysters and received fried chicken instead. It was actually kind of funny because the waitress insisted that despite it not looking like the picture in the menu, they were indeed oysters. I had each of my friends sample it before deciding conclusively that it was instead chicken. I ordered the sweet shrimp and received the standard raw shrimp on rice and fried shrimp heads. I ate one piece and nearly threw up. It tasted like an old aquarium, which is not a good place for raw shrimp to be. When I asked the waitress about striking it from the bill, she did. However, if that was my sushi restaurant and I was confident in the freshness of the food, I would have explained all that before striking it from the bill. The fact that they did not come over to speak to me speaks volumes about the freshness of their food. That is to say, it probably isn't very fresh. The hot food was a joke. My friend ordered bul golgi (Korean dish). It was absolutely pathetic. And it was 16 bucks. Unforgivable. The uni was good. For 7 bucks, I should hope that it is.

"4530 HardIng RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"I was extremely disappointed in almost ever aspect of Ninki. I was really excited to try this place out since it's really close to my apartment, but I should have known better based on all the previous spotty reviews. My girlfriend and I decided to stop in for lunch this past Friday, and even though there was not wait, the place was busy. The first thing I noticed when I walked in, was how huge this place was. It's not at all what I expected from the outside. With all the space in the restaurant, they didn't do a good job at filling it. It feels very empty, and cold. Now for the service. I honestly think our waitress chugged two Five Hour Energy's, and four Red Bulls before she came to our table! She had a heavy Asian accent and was talking a mile a minute. She tried to go over the lunch specials with me, and by tried I mean she flipped through my menu quickly and banged on a few pages. There were some things that were two for one and some things that were half priced, but which was which was a total guess. Between the time she brought out our drinks and when we ordered was probably fifteen minutes. And in those fifteen minuted we determined that their sushi menu was extremely over priced when compared to other Sushi joints in the city.    So for lunch we both stuck to the Hibachi menu. I ordered the steak and L ordered the shrimp. Both tasted alright, but it was nothing great. I ordered a side of fried rice that tasted like I was eating a stick of butter. I added some soy sauce to it, but then it just tasted like I was eating a stick of salted butter. I asked for the steak medium rare and it came out medium well, emphasis on the well. But, when the steak is cut into cubes the size of dice, it's hard to cook then to any other consistency other than well.Thankfully the Hibachi menu was 50% off, it was one of the specials that our hopped up waitress banged on when we first arrived, so lunch was only 12 bucks between the two of us.

There were only a few good sushi joints in Nashville and I had grown way tired of them all.

I was unsure of what I wanted to eat, so the head sushi chef asked me what kind of fish I preferred and then got to work. You see, I like it when a man can make a selection for me and actually get it right... and he did! Instead of tossing my food over the bar like most sushi chefs, he took the time to walk around and place the most beautiful looking salmon tartare in front of me. Presentation gets an A+ for sure. The salmon was very fresh, as was the avocado and the ginger. This dish was so wonderfully delicate, yet perfectly filling. I really took my time with it and savored each bite. The chef then asked if I liked eel, and OF COURSE I do, so he then prepared a small dish featuring some very yummy unagi.The service was great. Very consistent and not too overbearing.

In addition to being treated like I broke up a private party, I was scoffed at when I asked for low sodium soy sauce. I wasn't aware that request warranted that response.

The decor was great and not something you would expect to find in a restaurant located in a shopping center - it has a fantastic, modern vibe that was very welcoming, though I can't say that I found the new age music to be the best accompaniment to my Japanese dining experience. As for the food, we tried an assortment of things. I can't recall the names of all of the five different rolls we ordered, but I think I remember there being a Butterfly and a Yum Yum roll in the mix - both received great reviews. We also ordered chicken teriyaki (quite tasty) and an insanely large portion of chicken fried rice that was delicious. There were a lot of interesting options on the menu - bibimbap & other Korean offerings and fois gras, for example - and judging off of our first experience, I can't wait to go back and be more adventurous.Prices were very reasonable and they do have a lunch menu. Definitely adding this place to our regular rotation - but on that note, I must make my one slightly negative comment and say that the timeliness of the service could be tightened up a bit. Seeing as how it is in an area that attracts lots of business lunchers, being able to make it in and out the door pretty quickly is essential.

"4530 HardIng RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Ninki has all the intentions of trying to serve Japanese food.  However, it falls short of that, amongst other things.While its location is what brought me here, it is not AT ALL what you expect to see when you walk into a Japanese restaurant of any sort.  It looks like a late 80's, early 90's bachelor pad.  Kind of like black laquer threw up on Japan.  No bueno.The service was less than decent, considering it was a fair 20 minutes between visits from our waitress, who was extremely hyper and difficult to understand because of it.  Needless to say, we finally chose our Hibachi bowls (shrimp for me, steak for JTR), and then waited our ""alotted"" 20 minutes for the food.  Did I mention we watched a table of four (who ordered before us) get their food 5-10 minutes before us?The food smelled great.  I was extremely excited at the look of other people's plates, but when ours arrived, my hopes immediately dropped.  The veggies were covered in butter and oil, and my shrimp was sitting very lonely on the other side of the plate by itself.  A small heap of arugala made a nice wall between the veggies and the shrimp.  The steak looked fairly appetizing, but the plate was also pretty sparse and lonely looking.  At least serve this stuff in smaller plates so it doesn't look so pathetic!  JTRs fried rice tasted like a stick of melted butter.  Luckily, I found the silver lining on the menu: steamed rice.Recap?  I won't be back.  Proverb of the day: A Japanese restaurant's ability to not screw up a bowl of steamed rice is no reason to return.",Ninki,6153860072,224 reviews,2011-08-26,"Nashville, TN",/biz/ninki-nashville,2.0,77,"Washington, DC",Lyndi S.
"4530 HardIng RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Place was great when they still had $1 sake, but the prices were to draw in a crowd.  I still really love their sushi even if it is a bit pricey.  My guess is eventually the discounts on their pricing will disappear and so will the restaurant.  No one wants to pay $12 a roll for sushi.",Ninki,6153860072,236 reviews,2012-01-17,"Nashville, TN",/biz/ninki-nashville,4.0,77,"Washington, DC",Zach G.

"4530 HardIng RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"So, Ninki was pretty good. The service was was adequate, the group I was with was quite a handful. I would not come to this place for the rolls, they are definitely designed for people that just like rolls, not fish. We ordered a whole bunch, and only 2 were standoutish. The wasabi roll was ok, and the sumokaro(or some shit like that). The other rolls were just ok(the rolls a koto are way better, and a much better value).The other stuff was standout though, the yellowtail collar special was delicious, so was the monkfish liver special. That's not something you can get very good versions of in many places in Nashville, so kudos. We also had salmon roe with raw quail egg on top and it was delicious, really good. They had good sea urchin also, really fresh. The sashimi was good, very fresh. The prices were pretty reasonable, and the wine prices were pretty reasonable also. They have hibachi also, don't know how good it is. The food took a bit to come out, but we ordered an enormous amount of food, and it was kind of expected. The stuff was fresh, and well prepared so it's ok that it took a little long. It wasn't anything crazy. The service staff was ok, they're kind of new at it(at least ours was). It is not as good as koto, but is definitely a good second choice. I will definitely go here over virago, samurai, pm, or any of the other places I've been to in Nashville so far. The rolls aren't my style, but the other shit was pretty good.",Ninki,6153860072,112 reviews,2011-11-26,"Nashville, TN",/biz/ninki-nashville,4.0,77,"Washington, DC",Samuel L.

I'd give it a ""C-."" The meat was bland and overcooked, and I had to drown it in ""Yum Yum Sauce"" to make it taste better. The rice was undercooked and almost crunchy!Hubs ordered steak and shrimp and also damned it with faint praise.We also got cheated on our shrimp appetizer--never received it!

"3608 Anderson RdNashville, TN 37217",4.5,"We usually get China King if we are feeling like loading up on Chinese takeout, but over the years it's kind of gone downhill. We heard about this place and decided to give it a try. We ordered out on a Sunday around 8:15pm. An order of bourbon chicken combo, general Tso combo and an 8 piece order of crab rangoon. They told us it would be 15 minutes and we arrived about ten minutes after ordering and it was ready. I had never been in the area before, it looks a little rundown. The restaurant didn't have any customers in it when I entered to get the to go order. They have a LOT of handwritten signs that tell the different rules of the restaurant that doesn't make it feel very welcoming. The total for our meal was $21.33. We came home and busted it open. The bourbon chicken is a non breaded chicken, it had somewhat of a sweet/spicy sauce on it. It didn't taste like bourbon. The chicken was good though. The general Tso's had a LOT of sauce on it. The chicken in the bottom was covered, soaking in it. Maybe next time we will ask for the sauce on the side. The crab rangoon wasn't good. It was hard to bite into the wonton and the filling tasted like runny cream cheese. I wouldn't recommend getting them. The peas in the rice were a little on the firm side. I think that must be a Chinese restaurant issue around here though.",China Spring,6153666888,383 reviews,2015-08-11,"Nashville, TN",/biz/china-spring-nashville-3,3.0,31,"Washington, DC",Billy H.

The dumplings in my soup were hard and cold. The egg roll was chewy and tough. The orange chicken tasted like someone mixed orange juice and ketchup together and threw it on some chicken.

"3608 Anderson RdNashville, TN 37217",4.5,"I love China Spring. We discovered this little gem a couple of years ago when we were angry at mean ol' China Moon on Murfreesboro Road, and said ""screw it"", we're changing shops. Best chinese-food decision ever. This place is family-owned by a younger couple, and they are the nicest people! The girl is very sweet and remembers all of her regulars. When I was pregnant with my son, and was visibly showing, she ran around the side of the counter and put her hands on my belly. ""It's going to be a boy!"" she exclaimed. From then on, she always asked about the baby and once he was born she came out to the dining room to play with him and coo over him. If my husband goes to pick up dinner without me, she always asks about me. You can't beat the awesome service and genuine interest these folks display in their customers.Now onto the food! The portions are very generous. Typically my meal will last me through dinner and then lunch the next day. The hot and sour soup is hands down, the best I've had in Nashville. It's spicy, tangy and is chock full of yummy bamboo veggie things. The lo mein and fried rice are always fresh and tasty. My favorite is the beef and broccoli. The broccoli is always freshly steamed, and the beef is tender and cooked well. The Kung Pao Shrimp, General Tso's, and Happy Family are also very good. The pork fried dumplings are awesome, and are so big they can be eaten as a meal rather than an appetizer. My stomach is growling just thinking about it. If you call in an order, it'll be ready in usually 10 minutes, unless they have a rush and then you'll be looking at about 15. Their dining room is very clean, and decorated nicely.

For the sake of speed, the pizza is not baked long enough for the toppings to fuse to the cheese, so everything falls off when you eat it. I cannot argue with the flavours of said pizzas, however, as they taste amazing when you get everything in one bite.While on the topic of speed, this place is SO hit or miss with their wait staff- it is almost unbearable. There are some impeccable servers, and some that seem like they aren't even worth tipping. My parents used to order to-go from here a lot, but they have been disappointed too many times.

"21 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"One day my boyfriend and I will come here and order something other than pizza but so far we haven't made it happen. The pizza is just too good! I am a big fan of Neapolitan pizza. I adore a chewy, flavorful crust that is topped with a bubbly mix of tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. This is why I can't stop ordering the Margherita DOC. The pizza is large but I can usually finish it on my own. It always comes out pipping hot. The red sauce is dotted with large islands of creamy mozzarella cheese sprinkled with bright green strips of fresh basil. As you cut into the pizza the tomato sauce mixes with the mozzarella to create pink puddles that I sop up with my crust. Pair this with a bottle of red wine and you have created one of my favorite meals.In addition to pizza, my boyfriend and I usually enjoy either the house or the caesar salad. Both are excellent. The greens are fresh and crisp. The dressing is always correctly proportioned and I've regretted not asking for it on the side. We usually share a small because we plan on stuffing ourselves with pizza.They can get busy but they do not offer call head reservations. If you do have to wait, order your wine and sit at the bar.

"21 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"The restaurant is on the small side - 20 tables at the most and maybe 10 bar stools at the bar. It's located in a strip mall which is a bit odd, but so is J.Alexander's, so I don't judge a place by it's location.We had a party of 5 at Porta Via last night. Four of us were there at 6:30. I told the hostess there would be 5 of us and she led us to a table of 4 with no room for an extra seat. After telling her again there would be 5 of us, she took us to the bar to wait for a table to accommodate us.After about 20 minutes we were seated. Not bad for a Friday night.Our son traveled to Rome this past April and became addicted to buffalo mozzarella cheese.After researching where to get it in Nashville, he discovered PortaVia serves it.  We had to try it, so we ordered Caprese salad and calamari for the table.Their mozzarella di bufala ( buffalo mozzarella) is imported from Italy and their ingredients are very fresh. The salad was delicious. The cheese IS worthy of searching for.The calamari was very lightly fried. To me it was too chewy and could have used another minute or two in the fryer but everyone else thought it was good. For my entree' I ordered the Veal Scaloppine. My husband ordered the salmon, while the other 3 in our party ordered custom made pizzas. My veal was okay but a little heavy on the lemon juice - so heavy I asked my daughter to taste it to see if she thought the veal was bad. It was served with a little pasta and steamed vegs on the side which were good.My husband said the salmon didn't taste fresh and was a bit bland. The general census on the pizzas - good. We decided to order good strong Italian coffees after dinner only to be told they were ""OUT OF COFFEE""??? What? Seriously? On a Friday night it seems they could have gone and bought some for dinner service. That was a HUGE disappointment.On our way out I was reminded of the gelato assortment staring up at me from the freezer by the entrance. I bought 2 scoops of caramel and 2 scoops of blood orange gelato to take home for later. Around 11:00 last night I got a scoop of each flavor and it took a lot of willpower not to finish off the other 2 scoops ( my husbands ).The blood orange was good - tart and sweet, but the caramel was AMAZING. Will I return to Porta Via for a sit down dinner again? Maybe. Maybe not.Will I return for the caramel gelato to take home? YES...it may be a weekly habit because it is THAT delicious.

"21 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"After several visits, I can say with confidence that Porta Via is mediocre. There are better places to spend your time and money.The food varies-- the pizza and soups are typically good, while the pasta and gelato have been rather disappointing. I recently ordered some gnocchi and it was incredibly mushy. The bland sauce didn't help, either. The gelato isn't terrible, but if you're looking for the real thing, you won't find it here.Unfortunately, I also had a poor service experience here recently as well. The waiter who was serving the table next to us bumped into my very full martini glass and sloshed my drink all over our table. He didn't notice and when we pointed it out in a friendly way, he did a poor job cleaning it up and promised to bring me another drink... but never did. Our waitress seemed overextended and it was hard to get her attention at times.

VPN is Vera Pizza Napoletana.verapizzanapoletana.org/…On to the pizza: I ordered the Quattro Stagioni and my wife ordered the Bianca.  The problem I had with the pizza was the crust.  The edge was entirely too thick and tasted like Indian nan, not that it's a bad thing, but it's not what I want in a pizza.  The sauce was almost an after thought, it added color instead of any flavor to the pie.VPN pizza should be simple, yet the pizza here had too many toppings, causing the center of the crust to be soggy and not light and fold-able.  The weight of the toppings caused the pizza to fall apart.  One suggestion might  be to cook it for another minute in the wood burning oven to give it more char on the bottom.Everyone at my table had the same fate, some enjoy it that way, I do not.  I'm sure I'll be back again to try a simple Margherita pizza.The best part of our meal was the double chocolate gelato, words can't describe it.  If you're a chocoholic, this is your dessert.Lovely service and the prices are decent.",Porta Via Italian Kitchen,6153560001,201 reviews,2011-01-31,"Nashville, TN",/biz/porta-via-italian-kitchen-nashville,3.0,92,"Washington, DC",Peter K.

"21 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"I wanted Porta Via to be the most amazing Italian place in Nashville, because it opened up right by my house. So close, I could walk there. I was pumped for the opening. The place is nice inside. It's small, but trendy and open. When we first tried it, we were NOT impressed. So unfortunate. I first ordered the pesto pasta. And, that's all it was. A bowl of pesto pasta. No side salad or anything came with it. I normally like to have SOMEthing else with my pasta. They did serve some kind of bread with it. However, the bread was more like burnt crusts from a pizza. We were confused why they would bring us something so gross. Then, we noticed that the table next to us was being served nice warm pieces of real bread that looked fresh. When we wanted to ask our waitress why we didn't get that bread, she was no where to be found. Yeah, we weren't very happy. I then came back with a group of friends for a birthday party. I had to give them a second chance since last time they had just opened. So I figured they might have improved since then. This time, I ordered a margherita pizza. The pizza was very good, messy to eat, but very good. They also served warm, pillowy delicious bread with olive oil to dip it in with the dinner. Yes, they have improved. I was slightly more satisfied with my dinner the second time around. Not to mention, the gelato here is awesome. We have come back just for the gelato at times. As for the food, I would chose Coco's Italian Market any day. Even Maggiano's. If neither of those were around me, I might be more satisfied with Porta Via.

It had a perfect crema and smooth taste - by far the best I've had in this part of town. For lunch I ordered the Provencal, Greek salad stuffed into French bread. It was enormous and served with both a side salad tossed in a pleasantly garlicky dressing and a small pasta salad which was pretty but unremarkable in flavor. The only detractor from the meal was that the dressing inside the Provencal was too heavy, so I recommend you ask it be tossed lightly if you try the same.All in all, I got two full meals worth of food and a great espresso all for under $10.

I read that they make their pasta and sauces fresh daily, which was also a plus. I decided to order to-go and was audibly excited on the phone. Whoever took my order, on the other hand, was not. He was very short with me and pretty much suggested that my to-go order was really bumming him out. I assumed they were busy, so I wasn't affected. However, when I went to pick up my meal, there were two girls at the bar who were clearly more interested in their conversation about someone's personal life than my order. They yapped on and on to each other until one of them finally came over only to tell me my total, snatch my credit card out of my hand, and slam it back down on the counter in front of me. She then sloppily packed the to-go box into a bag and slung it my way. She never once made eye contact or said anything like ""thank you"". The pasta was awesome. Little heavy on the pepper, but really good. I've ordered it time and time again, though still I've received the kind of service one would get in prison. So that's why I've given this establishment only two stars.

I didn't pay too much attention until I saw the words Gluten Free!

I heard that the GF pizza's are amazing, but I was craving pasta and the menu says it is homemade .. so I went for it. I had gf pasta with the creamy tomato sauce and chicken. It was delish!!  The chicken was pretty plain and unseasoned so it tasted kind of ""funny"" to me. Maybe I can request it blackened next time? However I must include that my opinion on the way meat tastes can't be that trusted because I am a recent meat eater (I was vegetarian for years until I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease).  My boyfriend who loves meat  said it tasted fine, ha! The only ""complaint"" that I have is they are closed on Sundays. I rarely eat pizza, but when I do it's usually on a lazy Sunday. So I'm not sure how often I'll frequent. They also were a tad pricey for being such a casual place to eat. I understand them having to charge more for GF .. but our meal with tip was around $50 bucks, for lunch.

"21 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,This is my favorite pizza in Nashville so far. If you love wood fired and/or neapolitan pizza you can't go wrong with Porta Via.The place is kind of small. It is fine for lunch but if you come at peak dinner hour on a weekend expect to wait. I have been told they do not take reservations on weekends.The flat bread that they serve prior to your meal is excellent. I've never had anything but the pizza so I can't comment on the other dishes however I can't imagine ordering anything other than the pizza. Keep in mind that this is neopolitan pizza so if you are looking for a soft baked crust covered in lots of cheese you should look elsewhere. The key here is in the subtleties of flavors rather than a gluttony of quantity. Make sure you save from room for gelato after your main meal.

"21 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"This is only a temporary rating.  I came here with some friends hoping to try some authentic pizza.  I ordered the Margherita pizza, which was served just as they do in Napoli - unsliced.  The true way to eat pizza is to tear into it a bit, fold over, and continue to tear off until you have a delicious little morsel in your hand.  Everyone should definitely try this out!  I LOVED our pizza, but the restaurant did fall short in one area..... the pasta.I also ordered whole wheat fettuccine (They were out of angel hair.) and meat balls.  The meatballs had almost no taste, and the pasta was reminiscent of that served in school cafeterias across the country - soggy soggy soggy!  The only redeeming quality of this dish was the sauce.  I was later informed that they are soon revamping their pasta, which is out sourced, and are going to make their own pasta in house and introduce a new lineup soon.  I am looking forward to giving it another shot and hopefully change my rating.",Porta Via Italian Kitchen,6153560001,23 reviews,2010-08-31,"Nashville, TN",/biz/porta-via-italian-kitchen-nashville,3.0,92,"Washington, DC",Justin Y.

"21 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"I've tried to go to Porta Via a couple of times to no avail (closed on Sunday, an outlandishly long wait, and an even more outlandishly long wait). But this Friday we finally sat and waited long enough to vulture a spot at the little bar and then a table for our party, all of which took about an hour. Man, this place is popular! They don't take reservations (only call ahead, which they seemed to not honor anyway) and the hostess seemed to have no idea what she was doing, but at least they post a large poster of the menu outside so you can figure out what you want to eat and drink when you finally get your fanny in a chair. Gelato window was tempting pre-dinner as well.Once we got inside, we were welcomed with heavy pours of wine (NO WONDER why there are so many people in here...) and a basket of fresh focaccia bread and oil (why do no moderate restaurants in this city put bread on the table? maybe it's a southern thing...). Pre-dinner ceasar salads were made a little extra special with homemade croutons and good cheese, pasta dishes looked great (the forkfull of bolognese I swiped tasted good too), and my white pizza came out with a mountain of fresh arugula and a paper thin fresh slice of prosciutto. I should abide by my own rules, but I dug into the pie without letting it set and the resulting first half was on the soggy side. The mootz they use is reallllly fresh and by nature contains a lot of water...my own fault for not waiting. I wish they cut up the prosciutto to make it easier to relegate around the pizza, rather than having to tear it up myself to make sure I get piggy goodness on every chunk.

"21 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"This was my third visit to Porta Via.  I was so excited about Porta Via because the chefs had all worked under Mario and I have eaten Ricky's food before and think he's a good Italian chef.  My first visit I had the Margherita pizza and thought it just fair with watery canned tomatoes and four leaves of whole basil.  Second visit we had the Cappricciosa pizza and it was a little better.  My friend Mark thinks very highly of one of the Owner's so I keep giving it a try and hoping for a little more each time.Bistecca alla fiorentino is a simple but incredible dish of Tuscany featuring either a porterhouse or t-bone from their famous Chianina cattle.  It is cut very thick and usually serves more than one person.  It is salted and cooked rare very quickly over very high heat and served with lemon wedges.  So my steak came out and it was a large t-bone.  The herbs were not even chopped and were in big hunks, particularly the sprig of rosemary.  There was no 'crust', it looked rather drab brownish gray and was definitely lacking salt.  And instead of being thick like it should have been, it was rather thin and even though I ordered it medium-rare, it was probably a little towards medium than I would have liked.  It was just fair.  I didn't come close to satisfying my craving for a nice steak.  The vegetable of the day was a mixture of zucchini, yellow squash, onion and mushrooms.  They looked nice and caramelized but when I bit into them I could tell the color was coming mainly from a heavy dose of balsamic vinegar.  So overall, the meal was disappointing and I think I'm giving up on Porta Via.",Porta Via Italian Kitchen,6153560001,153 reviews,2010-07-31,"Brentwood, TN",/biz/porta-via-italian-kitchen-nashville,3.0,92,"Washington, DC",Melissa L.

Beer list was limited to crappy domestics like mich ultra and yuengling. Those are great for dive bars and places like Sam's but not for places with 13 dollars pastas. Very over priced for the quality of food. I will pay for rigatoni bolognese but, execute it properly. Don't overbook the pasta and use quality cheese and meat. They shaved fresh Parm  on the salad, why not on the pasta? Ground beef with tomato sauce does not make it bolognese. Pizza had the same problem. Pizza dough looked great but, not cooked long enough. I think they are afraid to get some good char on the crust. Every pizza I saw was barely brown. It came out doughy and uncooked in some spots. I really like the way they leave the pizza uncut, it's good  to stick to your guns about that kind of thing. If you go through the trouble of making your own dough and making your own pasta please use quality ingredients. Don't use artichokes from a can or use terrible katakana olives.

Even Domino's uses fresh mushrooms now!   Furthermore, the crusts are quite uneven from pizza to pizza, with a few displaying a nice puffy outer crust and a pleasant crisp/chew.  The others, though, are pinched and are merely crisp, without any joy to the mouthfeel.  The toppings, on the whole, are applied without thought to the overall pizza experience and the pizzas seem to be over topped to the point where the crust isn't even part of the flavor experience, save at the rim.  The sauce is not as bright as you would expect given the 'Neapolitan' tag, but upon closer inspection, they never claim to use San Marzano Tomatoes or make DOC pizza.  The table consensus was that although the pizza was tasty on some level, the gap between self-hype and results yielded a disappointing dinner.     Overall, I suppose this is a passable pizza place, at least by the overall standards of Nashville, but given the degree to which they claim to hold themselves, the chances of disappointment are high.",Porta Via Italian Kitchen,6153560001,1 review,2010-01-18,"Nashville, TN",/biz/porta-via-italian-kitchen-nashville,2.0,92,"Washington, DC",Saul M.

If you don't like it spicy, just eat the pho as is. (I can already smell the aroma of the broth as I'm writing this review!) My other favorite items from their menu is the red curry and their eggrolls. Sadly, their eggrolls are quite tiny but they are very delicious... (My order is always the eggrolls, V16- the beef pho with everything in it, and a honeydew bubble tea.) The sushi is pretty good, too... But please be aware they do not have sushi on Sunday's.

It is too good and you'll be missing out. Give them a chance as service can sometimes be good or bad depending on how busy they are. I feel like it can happen anywhere. 1. Sometimes you walk in and there is no one to greet you or seat you. (I've been here so many times that I just seat myself or our group just sits wherever we want... A lot of the regulars just come right in and seat themselves... I can always tell when there are newbies trying the restaurant because they just stand at the door waiting to be seated/greeted... Sometimes I'm very tempted to tell them to have a seat anywhere even though I don't work there) yes, I go so often I pick up on things... Almost like I live there... Maybe that's why I don't mind the sometimes bad or slow service. Even if they greet you, they'll tell you to choose your seat anyway.  :)2. I used to work within walking distance of this place and during lunch they are super busy. Sometimes the food will come out very late or they will not attend to you as much. (My coworkers and I have phoned in our orders before and it would be ready by the time we got there. It's helpful that way if you want to dine in during lunch. Sometimes our group was as big as 15 people.)3. You might not get your ticket fast enough if you're in a rush. If that's the case, just walk up and pay.

I've only had Thai food from there, but I saw many people enjoying sushi, Bahn Mi, and more.  I'm picky when it comes to Thai food, and push for the straight authentic and traditional more than the ""westernized"" versions.  While the Pad Thai that I had was more westernized, It still hit the spot for the taste I was looking for. Thai Papaya is a great place to stop in for a quick lunch if you're tired of the regular american food.

"321 Harding PlNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"Met up with a friend to have lunch here on my way into town, this is definitely an interesting place since the name would not lead you to believe there is also Vietnamese. I didn't think service was very slow but I was also too busy talking and had just driven about 2 hours but I think maybe we were there 45 minutes in total? I decided to get something Thai and went for stir fry basil with chicken. It was decent, it was such a long day I am struggling to remember what it came with veggie wise: bell pepper, onion, carrot, I believe were the only things. It wasn't too spicy but I wasn't looking for having something spicy anyway. It was a decent size portion for lunch, didn't really leave much left which is always a positive at lunch time.My friend had pho ga and was pretty disappointed because there definitely wasn't much chicken in there at all. Service was fine like I said but it is pretty much what do you want, here's your food, and then you go to the counter to pay, so it's like being in an Asian restaurant basically. Since I don't live nearby I don't exactly see myself coming again but if for some reason I was, I would probably stop back if I had a Thai craving.",Thai Papaya,6153311527,565 reviews,2015-01-10,"Atlanta, GA",/biz/thai-papaya-nashville-2,3.0,65,"Washington, DC",Amanda D.

I started with the Vietnamese spring rolls that were super fresh and had large shrimp and big slices of sliced pork plus veggies with that awesome peanut sauce to dip them in. Some of the best spring rolls I ever had. Also had a small bowl of the mixed meat pho which had a super good rich broth that needed nothing extra. Finished with a Vietnamese sandwich that was a french roll with warm sliced pork in a slightly spicy sauce along with cucumbers, carrots and cilantro. Super tasty.

The veggies were perfectly fresh and not overcooked, the pork was good quality, very tender and not overcooked, the curry sauce was perfect.  Not too sweet. I ordered the red curry extra spicy and for once a Thai place actually made it extra spicy on the first attempt. I usually have to end up saying extra, extra, extra, etccc to get it nice and hot.

"321 Harding PlNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"We wanted to go to King Market, but they were closed early for Easter so we decided to try Thai Papaya.One thing I will say, is that service is warm and friendly, but a little slow and sometimes awkward. Our server was younger and not great at English, but was very apologetic (even though he didn't need to be). He double checked everything we ordered and came back to the table to double check again. He told us it would take 10 to 20 minutes for our food to be ready and apologized again. Not sure why he was so apologetic, ha!My boyfriend was excited that they had Chang beer--which wasn't on the menu, but he noticed it in the fridge. The food didn't take long at all. I got the Curry Puffs as an appetizer; they were tasty but not anything amazing. They also have gyoza and summer rolls (nemh nuong), which I would love to try next time.Boyfriend got a side of Tom Kha soup; it was quite good. We both got curry (Panang and Green). What I noticed most about this place is that we both got a medium spiciness, and it was pretty spicy. I would say surprisingly spicy. Which is okay with me, but beware if you are looking for something mild.The hostess/owner (I'm assuming) came up and talked with us for a bit. She was extremely nice and made us laugh with some jokes, made us feel very welcome.It got a little confusing when we had sat there for a while talking, and our server didn't come back with the check or boxes. I figured we were supposed to pay at the register, but got some confused looks and the hostess seemed to scold our server (whoops!). All in all, the food was good. They had some interesting variety in the menu, so I'd like to come back and try more. Having a menu with multiple things that appetite me is always a plus in my book!

The Sushi Chef is a rookie but usually does a decent job (thicker cut, i don't mind) but ask for no mayo or extra wasabi forget about it.I recommend the V15, its a Vietnamese dish with everything you can think of in it on top of a vermicelli/lettuce salad. the dressing is light and adds a just the right tang/sweetness.I want this place to succeed, but it's two fold buddy. you have to have good food AND decent service.",Thai Papaya,6153311527,131 reviews,2012-12-03,"Portland, OR",/biz/thai-papaya-nashville-2,3.0,65,"Washington, DC",Laila S.

Well, first of all they have a wide range selection of menu items and I could not pick out what to get! They have Thai, Vietnamese and Japanese food. A weird combination at a restaurant but it seems to complement well somehowWe ordered the papaya salad here for our starter and man was it really spicy but darn good! They have a spice range level from 1-5 but we ended up getting a 3 which is not a medium spice level, but the spicy level where your tongue is burning and you need to sip down some water every time you take a bite of the salad!! I recommend the papaya salad definitely!I ordered the large pho. It was a pretty decent serving size but way too small of a portion compared to Kien Giang (by the way they have the best pho ever and for cheap too! Win win win!) I told my sis that this pho is pretty tasty for southeast Nashville area if you're too lazy to drive the other side of town. My sis ordered the seafood combination stir fry and her dish was pretty tasty and looked appetizing. There were mussles, shrimp, scallops, and squid and they were all cooked to perfection!Now for our service, it was ok... nothing out the ordinary considering the fact that most Asian restaurants are pretty horrible at service anyways. There were only 2 waitresses taking orders and they seemed to be taking turns in tending to customers. They are hard to understand at times but they managed to get the job down for us, somewhat. And lastly, before we paid our check, we decided to order some bubble tea as there was an advertisement sheet placed visibly in the napkin holders. I got Mocha bubble tea and the sis got Thai tea bubble tea. Let me tell ya, all the flavors they served made me want a Bubble tea but as I took a sip and looked at the consistency of the drink, it was pretty much inedible.

The house salad arrived positively drenched in the mayo-based ginger dressing. If that wasn't stomach-turning enough, there was also a pool of water underneath the lettuce. It took at least 10 minutes to flag down the lone waitress to request a replacement. The sashimi was good enough, but the white tuna was plated while it was still frozen. Waiting a couple of minutes to eat it did the trick, but really?Is the peanut sauce served alongside satay usually served ice-cold?To  make matters worse, the service is now consistently poor and exceptionally slow.

And now I can say because of this place I am addicted to the food here. This is my 2nd time eating here in two days, and coming from a curvy girl that's saying a lot.

It served primarily southern Vietnamese cuisine. Their beef pho was probably second best in Nashville.I actually ate here during the week when ownership changed. The new owners are Laos and promised that their cooks would not change. Whether they changed cooks or not, the quality of the beef pho went considerably down. Their Vietnamese dishes no longer taste Vietnamese.  When I talked to the new owners, they told me they were planning to add Japanese food to the menu. Apparently they went for a Thai direction instead. I personally feel like their menu overall won't stabilize for another few months and I really don't know if this restaurant will survive at all for another year or two. Vietnamese food= 1/5 stars.

"321 Harding PlNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"Since the recent change from just a Vietnamese restaurant to adding along Sushi/Japanese cuisine and Thai, this is an excellent place to take a group of friends who cannot decide on which Asian cuisine to settle for.The service is better than it was before the new owners came along, however if you are looking for speed, this is not the place for you.  Your silverware will not come until your food comes, and it is normal in all the times that I have been for the food to come out one plate at a time, despite the fact that everyone orders at the same time.  I like to think that this is because the food is so fresh.I'm a huge fan of the Vietnamese Spring Rolls, and if you are looking for the ones with Shrimp and Beef, this is it for you!  In addition, the peanut sauce is awesome, with its crumbled peanuts on top.  I have yet to try the Thai food, except for some of the stir fried rice that I tasted from my friends' plate---it is good, and not bad as a leftover.  I am a fan of the Pho noodles, with rare beef steak.  I enjoy it, although I noticed that they do not serve it with fresh basil, just the mint, soybean sprouts, lime slices and sliced jalepeno's.  The vegetables are a lot fresher than the previous owner.If you are a fan of Sushi, they have that as well---it'll get your fix, but it's not the best in town.  The miso soup is good, according to my friend, and if you are into Bubble Tea, I have yet to try one of their flavors that have let me down.  They make their Bubble tea with FRESH fruits, and of course, the tapioca balls.You want not so cold beer?  They have that as well.  Tsing Tao, as well as regular domestic beers.In addition, they now offer a delivery service ($30 minimum) and only a 3 mile radius from their location....this is information taken off of their printed menu from about 1 month ago.",Thai Papaya,6153311527,25 reviews,2011-10-17,"Nashville, TN",/biz/thai-papaya-nashville-2,4.0,65,"Washington, DC",Crystal J.

Unfortunately this round I didn't try the french coffee. The banh mi was good. The bread was crispy but had a softer texture than what I am used to.  The pho was above average.

At its worst night maybe a 3 bc of slow service, but we have never had a bad meal or bad service.We come here for good food, good conversation, good service, not for a ""seen and be seen"" ambiance. If you're looking for trendy or new Nashville, you won't find it here.  If you're looking for linen service, authentic, quaint, where a ""Godfather would go to just like in Chicago or New York"", come here.  They know good Italian food.I had dinner tonight with a party of 6 and we stayed until 11pm, when the restaurant closed at 10pm.  Not once did we feel rushed.  We had 2 large appetizers, drinks, 5 different entrees and shared 3 desserts and everybody was happy and couldn't stop raving about the food.  Every time I come here it is always a 4-5 star experience, no less.  I gave 4 tonight, bc they stopped serving my lamb and mussels appetizer.

"311 3rd Avenue SouthNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"We stopped in for a lunch before heading back home. Amex concierge recommended the place. It was Jan. 2 and the waiter said it was perhaps the slowest day of the year. It certainly seemed that way as there were only three other tables during our lunch. We ordered a glass of prosecco to begin the meal which was tasty but served in a red wine glass instead of a flute.We got the flatbread to start which was a little chewy rather than crisp. But it was thick with cheese. We had caesar salad - the kitchen forgot to put the dressing on. My wife had the eggplant parmesan which was served with marinara. I had the carbonara - lots of sauce, peas and pancetta. The waiter mentioned that the pasta was all made in house, so my wife also ordered a side of spaghetti with butter and garlic. The first time it came it was undercooked and without any butter or garlic. After another tour through the kitchen, it was still undercooked and the butter and garlic were not well integrated. We mentioned it to the waiter who took it off the bill. In contrast, the fettucine was cooked perfectly. We had some wine by the glass since the bottles quickly escalated to $60 or more. The wine complemented the dishes nicely.Time determined that we not sample the desserts or coffee. Overall, the service was good but the kitchen was quite spotty in the execution. So given the numerous options in downtown Nashville, we would not likely return to Sole Mio. Of course, the kitchen might have been staffed by the third string given our waiter's comment about the expected light attendance.

"311 3rd Avenue SouthNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"We checked in at the Hampton Inn behind Sole Mio after a long drive from Atlanta.  There was a storm approaching and we didn't want to search any further for a family meal.At first glance this does not look kid friendly.  There is no kid menu.  BUT they were very accommodating and my children were happier with the accommodation than if they had the worn out other option (ie freaking boring chicken tenders).My picky teenager does not like anything tomato sauce not a very good italian food eater.  But they made him what he phrased as ""The Best Plain Butter Spaghetti"" he'd ever had or will have.  Visually I can vouch for that - they were not plain as I saw some herbs were added but in a way Mr. OCD didn't care.My young foodie and I had the Eggplant Parmesan (Melanzane Parmigianno).  It was brought out on one plate and we were each given plates for splitting the dish.  This was not runny soaked in marinara sauce eggplant parmesan.  Where I grew up, lots of my friends were only second generation American born from their Italian immigrant grandparents.  I was in homes of their parents making old world Italian dishes - this eggplant parmesan was that!  It was just like the parent taking the slices of eggplant and weighing them down in a colander with an overturned plate and bricks to remove the moisture.  The individual treatment of each slice to make the larger dish makes a difference.  It was a wonderful return to childhood.I can't remember exactly what my husband ordered but it was a special.  It was salmon with some type of noodle, pancetta (I think).  Anyway, he was in heaven too.So a family of four - (teenager and ten year old) and all four were happy.  But keep in mind this is NOT a kid menu coloring book franchise place, it is for kids who can handle the atmosphere and do not need to be entertained with that overstimulating crap.And if you want to say the prices were high; please keep in mind these are fresh ingredients and not one thing tasted like it rolled off the sysco truck.  In my book that is worth paying more for!",Sole Mio,6152564013,29 reviews,2014-08-04,"Marietta, GA",/biz/sole-mio-nashville-2,5.0,132,"Washington, DC",J.

"311 3rd Avenue SouthNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"Was at the NAMM show last week and checked out Sole Mio for dinner on Friday night. Wow. That's what I can come up with right now as I think back on the deliciousness that was our meal.First off, their bread is crazy good. I know they say don't fill up on it, but I love carbs and I sort of did. But I don't regret it. Also, try the caprese - it was perfect.For dinner I did a pre fixe option with a Cesar salad, stuffed salmon with vegetable risotto and for dessert I got the chocolate amaretto cake. How I wish I could have that entire meal right here, right now!The salad was fantastic - everything seemed from scratch and the dressing was out of this world. The salmon - a huge portion and stuffed with yummy goodness like shrimp and other things. It came on a bed of vegetable risotto and although that was just slightly overcooked, the salmon more than made up for it. The chocolate amaretto cake was decent - good even - but I was missing the amaretto. Just not quite enough kick there.They've got a GREAT wine list and even though the service was a little slow, our waiter was pretty on top of it and attentive. He knew the menu well and gave some great suggestions.

"311 3rd Avenue SouthNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"Absolutely horrible. I am from Detroit, Michigan and I have been to Nashville 5-6 times. My husband asked me to pick any cuisine, so I chose Italian. I looked for 2 days for the perfect place. After all the negative comments on yelp I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. I was so disappointed. I am in the business and work at a fine dining Italian restaurant and I would and could never treat a guest the way we were treated. First of all, our service was so slow, our server was arrogant and didn't really have much knowledge about the food. I work in a high end Italian restaurant and I know all about the food. This place had maybe 4 tables and it still took at least 10 minutes to receive water. My sister in law asked for blue cheese olives and the server said he had to stuff them. It literally took 15 minutes. Her martini was half gone when he finally reappeared. She asked another  server: ""What is taking so long?"", and his response was: ""He is stuffing your olives (with hand gestures) then said,""you did ask for stuffed olives? Didn't you?"" How unprofessional!!! Very ignorant behavior with no customer service knowledge. Food was average at MOST. I have never left less then 20% EVER. It was the first time!This is also the first time review for me and I have had bad service before.

Had lots of flavor too!I had the spinach gnocchi with the Mama Rosa sauce and chicken for an entree. It was nice and creamy. Gnocchi was really soft though.

"311 3rd Avenue SouthNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"Just for the record: you may see 4 stars here, but it's really 3.5.After seeing a show at TPAC last night, my boyfriend and I were famished and on the prowl for grub. Our first choice was Indian on Demonbreun but they close at 9:30pm on Fridays (whaaat?). Next up... Sole Mio! This place has always been recommended to me and based on the reviews of my fellow yelpers, it looked like a hit or miss. ""What've we got to lose?"" I said. We decided to give it a shot.The valet parking was full so we drove around until we could find street parking. No problem since it was a nice night and both of us like to walk. Upon arriving, the host commented that we'd just missed the theater rush, and he was right. We were one of maybe five parties in the place.On first impression, the restaurant was a nice size. Lots of tables, good dimly lit ambiance, but not so intimate where I felt I had to whisper. For only five occupied tables in the house though, it seemed that service was a tad slow to start. Our waitress was friendly and VERY complimentary, however. (""You have beautiful hair. And beautiful eyes!"" Hello, ego boost.) And after that, it seemed to pick right up.For me, a glass of Chianti Classico - a new wine on their menu that is surprisingly not bitter or dry for a chianti. Quite delicious, in fact! For him, a Manhattan on the Rocks. Stout, as always (she says not being a whiskey drinker), but noted that this drink was shaken not stirred. And that surprised my boy, for whatever reason.An incredible fresh Caprese starter with some of the best mozzarella either of us have had. Chicken Marsala for him... which I thought was good, but nothing special. My entree on the other hand was outstanding. Rich, but outstanding. Do yourself a favor and order the Pumpkin Tortelloni with Sage Butter sauce at least once in your life. And don't skimp on the fresh parmesan and ground pepper.No dessert for either of us, as the bill had already come to $70+ at that point, but they did bring out two adorable biscotti with our check.So, yes. 3.5 stars for great food and good service, but expensive fare and smallish portions for the price.

"311 3rd Avenue SouthNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"When I think of great Italian, I think of mobsters, The Godfather, and the rotund Italian grandmothers that make their food.So heading to Sole Mio wearing a fine suit, I prepared to eat dinner before heading to the opera at the Schermerhohn a few blocks away. It was truly an Italian Mob Boss experience.Flaw #1. The place has no ambiance. On one wall you are staring at the street. A mostly empty parking lot with an aging 1970's building in the background. A view of a garbage dump may have been preferable. Or curtains. Instead, any Mob Boss eating here is just asking to be whacked in a drive-by, or to be watched by the Feds that are surely watching from a parked van, or the re-purposed building.Not expecting to be whacked tonight, I decided to sit with my back to the horrid view. What I got, was a mural of the SAME GODDAMN VIEW!OK, ambiance:0The waiter came, and I have mentioned many times in my reviews, I don't like to ding a place because I happened to get a poor waiter, but seeing how this buffoon knew nothing about the menu, and didn't understand our time constraints with the Schermerhohn (though since this is one of the closest restaurants, it must be a common request), I had half a mind to throw him into the Cumberland (a river running through Nashville for you out of towners) with a pair of concrete shoes. The feds must be trying a set-up here.Staff: 0The final insult - no not the final one, that comes with the bill - but the tasteless one was the food itself. We ordered the Sole Mio's Symphony Special, and started with the Antipasto Platter for Two. Cold cuts, jarred veggies, and cheese, all clearly made earlier in the day and held in the walk-in until it was served. Cheese flavors bloom with warmth, so cold from the fridge is simply terrible. Then the main course. It wasn't the worst, but the owner should be smacked for calling it Italian. The food was bland. It was as if there was a global shortage on basil, oregano, and garlic. If they couldn't season it with salt and pepper, they didn't season it at all. I wonder if there are windows in the kitchen, or can the cook (I won't call him a chef) be rubbed out without witnesses?Food: 1Then came the bill. $120 for dinner and wine, not including tip. I could see being upset about paying $40 for food so lackluster, in a McDonalds quality atmosphere. That's right boys and girls, 57 reviews (at the time of this writing), and only one place is so awful based on quality and value, that I will give it my 1st ever 1-star rating.Seriously, if you rated this place 5-stars, your idea of Italian up to this point was the high school cafeteria or Chef Boyardee.

While we have been here many times before it was  the first time I recognized the grape vines growing on the outside balcony. A really nice touch for an Italian restaurant. The antipasta appetizer was the perfect portion to share between two. The table bread was the best we have had and this restaurant provides both balsamic and olive oil on the table as a condiment, which is quite convenient for those of those who love olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette with our bread. Our entrées were as good as they usually are but they tend to be rather pedestrian. We really like this restaurant for its wine selection, appetizers and desserts. You could have all of the three above and skip the entrée and still have an enjoyable evening and have the full experience this restaurant provides, which would save you a lot of money.  Another option is the sharing of an entrée which are generally large portions and again are tasty but nothing spectacular.

"311 3rd Avenue SouthNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"There are so many mixed reviews about Sole Mio that I figure I best put in my two (or ten )cents...There is a fine line between love and hate....that would explain all experiences I've had, but I do love it. I was torn between giving Sole Mio a three or four star and ultimately have decided on four because I have been there about a dozen times and intend to go back.  I've never had the lunch so I have no idea about that. This is a great date place, but I have also been with a friend and it was equally as wonderful. Now as far as the bathroom water being hot? Yes, it can be, but they post a warning. Also a one personer. Not the best, but the the place is not huge so not usually a line, maybe one person ahead of you...I have been there sometimes and have been so in love with the restaurant that I would of made out with it if it were a person, but I have also been there sometimes and would of punched it in the face. Why the array of feelings? Service and food. Its serious hit or miss. Its a shame that a place with such lovely atmosphere and in a prime location (we park there before going to the Symphony) wouldn't be more consistent. I have had waiters that were amazing and some that looked and acted like they just rolled out of bed. I have to say though I have been there so often that I have fine tuned MY experience so there is no longer a ""miss"" regardless of the staff. The food? I always get the same thing now. I've had dishes that were so/so so now I always order off The Symphony Special. I always have a nice red wine which varies. The waiters are really good about recommending and allowing ""tastes"" for you to decide. I like the bread they give you. Yum yum. I follow that with the Antipasto Platter for Two. An Exquisite selection of meats, marinated vegetables and choice cheese. For main course order the Cioppino ($6.00 extra)Fresh Red Snapper, Mahi, Clams, Swordfish, and Scallops preparedin a light tomato sauce and served over Linguini. It is SOOOOO good. Good and full. They don't skimp on the amount of seafoods that are in the dish. Totally worth the extra charge. Dessert? Whatever you are in the mood for.

We went there for lunch recently and had an excellent experience. The decor was not that impressive so my first impression was not that positive. Our server was a great guy and he knew the menu very well. We decided to go with his recommendations mostly. We picked our order from the Lunch Specials menu and started with antipasto plate for two which had some cured meats, artichokes, grilled red pepper, cheese, and walnuts and was pretty generous in size. We did not have intentions to have wine for lunch but once we ordered the antipasto plate, ordering wine was inevitable. From there on, it was a smooth experience. Although this place is known for the home made pasta, we ordered fresh grilled salmon stuffed with spinach, some asparagus on the side, and some sauce which i don't remember. The portion was pretty big and I can tell you that it was one of the best grilled salmon dishes I had here in Nashville. It turned out to be an excellent plate!We also ordered desert and decided to share a carrot cake. The carrot cake was huge and was more than enough for two.

"311 3rd Avenue SouthNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"I must admit, I ended up at this restaurant primarily due to circumstance. The owner of this fine, Italian Restaurant ended up being one of my mothers clients at our work. The topic of our Nashville vacation came up, which is when she mentioned how she owned this restaurant. After looking up some information and hearing mixed reviews around downtown Nashville, we ended up giving it a try. The warm, delicious bread that they served once we were first seated was an instant hit at our table. However, once our homemade Sangria was brought to our table I instantly fell in love! Following was our appetizers which ranged from Cesar salad to the Eggplant Rollatini to the Manicotti which was all delicious.

"311 3rd Avenue SouthNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"DH and I ate here while attending a conference in Nashville last Friday.. We were looking for something within walking distance of the Renaissance hotel downtown and this sounded good. While we enjoyed most of our food, I felt it was not a good value for the amount we paid. I expected Nashville prices to be lower than Chicago, not higher.The room was very cozy; not a particularly Italian ambiance but definitely cozy and welcoming. We liked the soft jazz music instead of hokey Italian tunes playing in the background. The wine list was fairly limited and pricey ($9.00 for chianti). Dh had a Dos Perros from Yazoo - a local brewery which he had discovered the day before at our hotel bar and enjoyed.We found the waitress to be extremely pleasant, warm and welcoming - no complaints about the service at all! The bread, however, was another story. Now, I am a huge carb-lover but this bread was inedible - absolutely no taste (think it was salt-free or something). It came to the table already buttered so there was no way to improve the flavor with oil (no cheese was offered). After one bite, I set the bread aside and hoped for the best from our entrees.I was very pleased with the veal marsala I ordered (22.95). It was very tender and the slightly creamy marsala sauce was delicious as were the side of roasted vegetables that were perfectly seasoned. DH ordered the lasagna (14.95) that I felt was too dense and undersauced. He liked it ok, but wouldn't put it in his top 5 list! I should add that no salad and/or soup was included with the entrees.After seeing several intriguing desserts being delivered to other tables we had to try one at least! We took the waitress' recommendation to try the evening's special - the zabaglione. It was a semi-frozen round of custard flavored with Marsala bathed in Grand Marnier and topped with a spun sugar fan. It certainly made for a satisfying end to the meal. We were glad we had to walk back to our hotel to walk off some of those calories.",Sole Mio,6152564013,109 reviews,2009-04-06,"Crest Hill, IL",/biz/sole-mio-nashville-2,3.0,132,"Washington, DC",Sandi P.

It was grilled with lemon and served with capers and penne pasta in a pomodoro sauce.  The meal was well planned and balanced.  The use of fresh ingredients brought out the flavors in the fish and pasta, while keeping things light.  I should add that the other seafood dishes looked equally tasty.  I couldn't bring myself to try the cheesecake or chocolate deserts - I was too full - so I tried the tangerine sorbet, which was also made on site.  It was perfectly refreshing and tart, with nice little sections of tangerine mixed in.  I'd love to come back for dinner, although I hear that this place fills up on symphony nights, so plan accordingly.",Sole Mio,6152564013,198 reviews,2007-06-15,"Nashville, TN",/biz/sole-mio-nashville-2,5.0,132,"Washington, DC",Paul H.

Ever wanted to play Russian roulette with your sushi? Now you can.  They have a Dare Devil roll, in which ONE random piece is loaded with Habanero Bullseye sauce.

I got the mayo on the side because I don't handle spicy very well, but trust me when I say it's not hot at all, just delightful. I'm not big on fries, but the fries here are actually fantastic. The meal was wonderful. My friend ordered a cheeseburger with a jalapeño aioli and she really enjoyed her meal too and said she will be bringing more friends back soon. I also grabbed a side of eel nigiri because I wanted to try the sushi. Unfortunately, the sushi didn't quite measure up for me.

"2119 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"I heard about Lucky Belly through Eater and after I got off work tonight, my boyfriend and I decided to get a spontaneous dinner here. The ambiance is very hipster/mellow/cool and I loved the graffiti artwork found throughout the place. I decided to get a virgin Cookies and Cream shake and a Surf n Turf roll without the jalapeno and a side of eel sauce. My boyfriend opted for a House Salad and the Truck Stop Burger. Be warned: the dressing on the House Salad is not the typical dressing you find at Japanese places, as it has a peanut-y flavor to it. My boyfriend's burger was incredible and the fries were phenomenal. My roll came with the jalapenos I didn't want and a .50 cent charge for eel sauce on the side (one of my biggest pet peeves at sushi places). I felt like the amount of food we got wasn't worth the price. However, my roll was really, really good.The thing that really irked me about this place is that the virgin shakes are the same price as the spiked ones. I just don't understand how that works or whose idea that was but it's stupid and needs to be changed. If I wanted to pay for booze, I would have ordered booze.Overall this place was okay, but it would take fixing logistical and price point issues before we return.",Lucky Belly,6153835770,11 reviews,2015-01-30,"Nashville, TN",/biz/lucky-belly-nashville,3.0,57,"Washington, DC",Katherine H.

I had the truck stop burger and it was delicious. I love thin burger patties and so few places offer it in Nashville so I really enjoyed the two thin patties with the cheese and ""secret sauce"" (which was very similar to a thousand island). What really stole the show was the fries. They were perfectly crispy and had tons of flavor. Lucky Belly really seasons them well.My wife had the chicken burger and loved it. I had a bite and I may order that next time for something a bit lighter.

"2204 Elliston PlNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"First, the reviews here. Saying ""Some of the best sushi I've had in Nashville"" is already a tip-off. Nashville is not known for its sushi. Additionally, most of the Japanese restaurants in Nashville specialize in rolls, sometimes the weirder the better. Regular Japanese fare, like tsukemono (pickles), or good rice, go by the wayside.My wife and I had a sudden hunger for Japanese food - sushi for me, stir fry and gyoza for her. After checking the reviews here and on other sites, and looking at on-line menus, we set out for Osake (or O'sake) with high hopes, already hungry for agedashi tofu, Japanese pickles, miso-yaki (cod) and several other dishes hard to find in Nashville. Let me say this first - they have finally posted a correct menu on their own website. Almost every other menu, including their Facebook site, is wrong. The Menuism site in particular has their old menu, with mouth-watering items like soft shell crab and Nabeyaki Udon. None of them were available.Apparently, the original menu, which looked fantastic, needed to be ""dumbed down"" for Nashville and the Vanderbilt students who frequent this area. So no agedashi tofu. No Japanese pickles. No anything we'd gone for in the first place.The waitress was very nice, but seemed stunned that any online menu was incorrect. (Of course, she also thought their delivery service delivered to the local hospital wards, which was completely incorrect as well.)We were mightily disappointed, but starving, so we went ahead and ordered a few things. Here's the list:-- Vegetable gyoza, one order, very average. Tasted like the ones you buy from Trader Joe's, only not as well cooked. Sauce that came with them was miniscule, we had to ask for more.-- Shrimp shumai, one order, also average. Small amount of sauce but enough. However, no mustard, though they brought it on request.-- House salad with ginger dressing (came with stir fry). The dressing resembled the old Ben Kay dressing , very creamy and tasting of mayonnaise, weirdly enough. No discernable ginger. Basic iceberg lettuce. -- Shrimp stir fry noodles (one order) were good enough that we'd order them again. A surprising amount of large shrimp, everything tasted very fresh. Unusual for a stir fry restaurant around here.-- Salmon sushi (one order, two pieces, same as the below) - average at best. Pretty tasteless.-- Tuna sushi - ditto.-- Ikura sushi - slightly better than average. -- Steamed pork bun (one order) - good, would order again.The chef was good, I'll give them that. But our meal for two - consisting of the above, lunch menu, was over $50!!!Given that the place was completely empty at lunch hour, if I were them I'd go back to what the previous owner was doing. We were all set to make this our ""go-to"" Japanese restaurant, but I don't think we'll be back.",O’Sake Japanese restaurant,6153400058,144 reviews,2015-05-23,"Utrecht, The Netherlands",/biz/o-sake-japanese-restaurant-nashville,2.0,60,"Washington, DC",Krash T.

"2204 Elliston PlNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"I think I was more letdown by the sort of half-hearted attempt at service here. It was only a third full but everything seemed to take forever. Ironically, they initially tried to rush us (asking if we were ready to order when we basically sat down) and then seemed to disappear for a while. The sushi was passable. Anymore, a lot of sushi places make essentially the same rolls, just with different names, and O'Sake was no different. Most of the flavor came from spicy rolls.

I also tried the yaki udon, the ramen, and the bulgogi (yes, I know, it's not Japanese food, but still..) and I moderately enjoyed all three items.

That being said, my fiance and I started with the gyoza and squid tempura which were perfectly cooked and delicious! As for the sushi it was very flavorful and fresh, but unlike their across the street competition, not overpriced. Moreover, they have a huge variety of combos which for me is almost unheard of to find, and the only other place with that amount of variety is Arigatos (Surprise).

"2204 Elliston PlNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"Like most people on a budget, I love deals, especially easily attainable ones. So when I had a deal on my Scout Mob app for 50% off of O'Sake, of course I walked over and wanted to take part in some sushi!Looking at the menu, I decided on the two for $9.99. I read the menu thoroughly to see if any where it noted it wouldn't be included in a discounted price, but I couldn't find it (I could be wrong). The server asked if I wanted soup or salad, and I told her to surprise me and she brought me out both! I was happy with that (she didn't charge me extra either). I ordered a crunchy crab and california roll; i figured something a little different and something basic. I was not pleased at all with the california roll. I wish i could note why, but I'm not quite sure what it was. The crunchy crab roll was SO DELICIOUS!! I want to go back and order it again and try the crunchy shrimp.When it came time to get my check, I showed her my Scout Mob and of course, the deal didn't work towards it. I was kinda bummed I didn't know prior, since I wasn't happy with half my order, but the service was really good from the server, and the crunchy crab was so yummy, that I really didn't care.Can't wait to try that crunchy shrimp!!",O’Sake Japanese restaurant,6153400058,20 reviews,2013-01-07,"Mt Juliet, TN",/biz/o-sake-japanese-restaurant-nashville,4.0,60,"Washington, DC",Jessica T.

"2204 Elliston PlNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"Some of the worst sushi I've had in Nashville, including the refrigerated grocery store variety. Really, it was that bad. I went during lunch and maybe this just isn't the time to go, but the rice seemed stale and was not seasoned properly. Most of the ""special"" rolls seemed to rely a bit too much on fried ingredients and overpowering sauces. A friend ordered a special spicy soft-shell crab roll that was actually covered in lumps of fried tempura batter and shredded surimi (AKA fake crab). It was by far one of the nastiest looking rolls I've encountered and may have been responsible for my friend's post-lunch stomachache.The name O'Sake should have been a tip off not to go, you're not going to find amazing and authentic sushi at a place that thinks sushi and sake make a good pair, but I'm the kind of sometime sushi snob that can appreciate overwrought nouveau-sushi when it tastes good.

It originally attracted me because it bills itself as an izakaya (a sort of melding of a bar and a restaurant). Inside it reminded me of many of the joints I'd hung out at in Matsuyama, Japan. Since then I've been many times.The sashimi is usually very good and the rolls are excellent. I'd recommend the Cherry Blossom roll most definitely. The Caterpillar roll is also a great one to check out. Wash all of that down with one of their sakes or (my favorite) one of their large bottles of Orion beer. The atmosphere of the place is very intimate. The chef, Jae, will often chat you up, and the waitress is very sweet.I guess I have to put at least one complaint in here...

"239 4th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",4.0,"Last year one of my uncles invited me to go to lunch at Varallo's Chili Parlor.  Until then, I had never heard of this place after being in Nashville for over 15 years.  Last week I was headed across town for lunch break errands, and traffic on 40 was gridlocked.  Me and a buddy got off the interstate, and ventured downtown.  After circling a few times looking for a place to park, we finally found a place on the street a block or so away.Probably my favorite part of the trip was walking through the arcade.  Again, being in Nashville for over 15 years, I didn't know this place existed. Most of my downtown experiences had been on Broadway, 2nd ave, and SoBro.  I was blown away at the atmosphere and dining selections in the arcade.  There were so many choices that it was difficult to make it all the way to Varallo's.Once we arrived, there was a steady line and a nice lunch crowd.  It was easy to tell the crowd were regulars by the conversations they were having with the staff.  At a chili parlor, what else do you order besides chili?  I was expecting some revolutionary chili that would blow my mind.  Honestly, if you would've told me that I was eating Hormel, I wouldn't have been surprised.This little diner had the greasy spoon ambiance that is so closely associated with a great burger, so I also ordered a steak burger.  The burger was good, but was obviously made from a frozen patty that lacked the flavor and sear that only comes from fresh beef. I was expecting something different, something better.Overall, I'm glad I tried a place with such a rich history in Nashville.  Unfortunately, I wasn't overly impressed with the food or the experience.  I'd go again, but wouldn't make this part of a regular routine.",Varallo’s Chili Parlor and Restaurant,6152561907,68 reviews,2014-12-23,"Nashville, TN",/biz/varallos-chili-parlor-and-restaurant-nashville,2.0,38,"Washington, DC",Jason B.

"239 4th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",4.0,"Varallo's is one of those time machine type restaurants where as soon as you step in the door you feel like you have been transported to a different era.  Makes sense as Varallo's has been around since 1907.  To stick around that long you have to be doing something right.  In Varallo's case they do a couple of things pretty darn well, specifically, homestyle southern cooking and old school chili.  The chili is probably the best place to start since it is right there in the restaurant title.  I called it old school and I think that is the best description.  This is straight up middle america chili.  It is red, beefy and tastes a lot like chili powder.  If you grew up eating your mom's chili then this is probably not too far from your childhood memories (unless your mom is from the southwest in which case this is not the chili you are looking for.)  I am partial to the hot chili which comes with tamales in the bottom and is extremely filling for under $5.  They also have chili on spaghetti for those from North of Kentucky.  Adding on a grilled cheese sandwich also seams like the move for long time customers and makes sense as it just backs up the whole comfort food/mom factor.  For my $5 there are not many better meals on a cold dreary day than a hot bowl of Varallo's chili.  The Southern meat and 3 options are also surprising good.  I have not explored many of the main course options as the fried fish is the only thing I ever get.  I am not a huge fried fish fan (usually gives me a stomach ache from the grease), but the fish at Varallo's is crispy, fresh, and to my taste almost grease free.  Add a some greens and beans and bit of hot sauce and you have got a mean meal.  Allegedly, they also have some tasty breakfast options with the county ham biscuit being the standout, but since I am usually running late to work I have not sampled them myself.  Overall Varallo's is a great establishment for the downtown crowd.  It is good, cheap, and historic.  Not bad for a place that your great- grandfather might have visited.",Varallo’s Chili Parlor and Restaurant,6152561907,214 reviews,2012-08-08,"Nashville, TN",/biz/varallos-chili-parlor-and-restaurant-nashville,4.0,38,"Washington, DC",Ian R.

"239 4th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",4.0,"Varallo's is a great little lunch spot for the downtown crowd.  I am a big fan of chili, and I am happy I found this place. Although it was not the number one tastiest bowl of chili I've eaten, it still hit the spot in a big way.I had the Chili Hot, which was a bowl of chili with a tamale at the bottom. I was worried at first that I would still be hungry, but I found it to be filling and tasty. The tamale was flavorful, and the chili's texture was nice and thick.They have a lot of other options on the menu aside from Chili. There were several Meat-And-Three options, along with a handful of chili derivatives (chili mac, chili 3-way, etc.). There were also breakfast/brunch options, although I did not try any of them this time.A lot of other reviewers have mentioned the friendly staff. I wholeheartedly agree. The owner personally took my order, and he certainly has a talent at putting a smile on your face. That counts for a lot.The only reason I'm not giving a fourth star is that I (just like another reviewer) usually like my chili a little more spicy and complex. This was more fall/winter comfort food than a delicacy.  While I disagree with the 1-Star reviewer who complained that it was no better than canned Hormel, it definitely tasted better after the addition of some Tabasco.

"239 4th Ave NNashville, TN 37219",4.0,"I read about Varallo's in the Tennessean. This is shocking since there is so rarely anything of value in the paper. Since I was working downtown, I stopped in one day, and it is good chili. I think my least favorite thing was they expected me to know exactly what I wanted right away. It was an odd experience for a first timer, if that makes sense. You know how some restaurants just expect you to know their menu and what you want and don't want to take time to explain things to you? Kind of like that.I had chili and a grilled cheese sandwich. Pretty basic comfort food on a cold day. They forgot my grilled cheese so I had to go back to the register to remind them. They brought it out lickety-split and were nice enough to give me some more chili to go with it. Lots of bonus points for that. Varallo's also has meat and three options, but I think people go for the chili and rightly so. A longstanding Nashville institution, you should check it out if you are downtown for lunch.

The feedback was mixed. I decided to not purchase the Groupon because were going to be dining at lunch time and I didn't think we'd spend the 30 bucks.We entered the restaurant at 11:45am on Sunday. It wasn't too busy at that point, but it did start to fill up around 12:15pm. Fill up, not overly crowed though. They have a full sushi, Japanese, and Chinese menu you can order from, but I feel if your going to a place called Sushi Train, you ride the train. The train is a long, covered and refrigerated train that takes 12 minutes and 49 seconds to make a lap. Yes, we timed it. The items on the train are on color coded plates, each color representing a different price. The lunch (11:am-2:30pm) prices are $.99, $1.25, $1.75, $2.25, $2.75 and $3.25. For dinner (4pm-Close) prices are $1.25, $2.00, $2.50, $3.00, $3.50, and $4.00.Our server was prompt & asked our drink order & we told him we were going to have the $8.99 lunch special. It really is special. For $8.99 you'll have your pick of ANY plate on the train, except the pricey red plates. It's ALL YOU CAN EAT. The train has different rolls, from cooked to raw. It also has desserts that coast around on it. The sushi. The sushi is good. It's comparable to what you'd get at a good sushi restaurant. It isn't AMAZING, but for the price you cannot beat it. From the rolls I had, only two I didn't care for. One was because I grabbed a ""Philadelphia roll"" that was cooked. I didn't see the cooked part & I hate smoked salmon. It tastes like cat food (I don't know what cat food tastes like). The second one I had was a tuna roll that had been on the train too long, the rice on the outside was dryish. Overall it's a neat little dining experience & a great value for the $8.99 lunch special.

The hostess sat us while taking a phone call (as in she picked up the phone as she was showing us to our seats and then scuttled off). The server was very thorough and genuine with his recommendations and catering to our needs even knowing we were primarily here for the a la carte sushi.

The one where I always thought, ""Wouldn't it be the coolest if this was an actual thing?""Turns out, that is an actual thing.Sushi Train is definitely an experience that everyone should try once. Sushi goes by your table on a conveyor belt, and it is your task to be attentive and quick enough to grab the good ones as they go by. You are charged based on the number of plates you have at the end of the meal (each color is worth a different amount, going up to $4  for the most expensive--prices are eminently reasonable). Of course, if you are not really a sushi eater, you can always skip the super-fun part of this whole restaurant experience and opt to try hibachi or Chinese food off the more traditional menu instead.

"94 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Sushi delivered fresh to your table via... conveyor belt? Yes it's exactly what it sounds like, my friends. I guess Sushi Conveyor Belt isn't quite as catchy. I love sushi and the concept is really fun. I usually feel like I'm going to explode when I eat sushi simply because I can't decide on one or two rolls and end up over eating due to my severe sushi FOMO. (Fear Of Missing Out). Since the whole concept of Sushi Train revolves around getting tiny plates of sushi samples I don't have that problem here. Anything I've ever ordered off the menu was fresh. However, I know you're really here for the ""train"". If you're going to use the train instead of the menu, you probably want to keep your table to 4-6 people. Beyond that, the people at the far end can't see anything as it whizzes by. This takes away from the experience and could cost you a few friendships if you're not careful. Sometimes the sushi on the train isn't very fresh and they seem to have trouble keeping certain rolls stocked. If you see something you like you better grab it fast because dinner will be over before it comes back around. The restaurant is clean and I've always experienced good service.

Unfortunately, they add up QUICK, so the R x R crossing can be dangerous if you don't look both ways.  There's also an average of three pieces per plate, so if you can, board the train with a group divisible by three. I would recommend the place, but we only go here when we can buy our train tickets on sale (groupon). Otherwise it's just too pricey.

"94 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"I am always hunting for new and exciting sushi places. This one was exciting, but not really for the food so much as the atmosphere.When you walk in, you can't tell if they were going for a nightclub or weird 70's diner feel. The neon and LED lights all over suggest nightclub, but the enormous windows have a screen or something over them, it always looks dreary outside no matter what the weather.The main attraction here isn't the sushi so much as how it gets to you. A waiter brings your drinks, and then, if you're ordering from the lunch menu as I have, you pay $8.99 for all the plates you want that aren't red (the red ones are extra).  A refrigerated conveyor belt snakes throughout the restaurant, with placards before each dish revealing what they are. When you spot a dish you like, simply lift up one of the tube doors and grab it! They don't seem to restock too often, so you might be out of luck if the dish you want doesn't appear on the first go round...or the second.The sushi itself is all right, but it didn't stand out to me in any way. The dishes seemed heavy on the tempura and spicy mayo, and the healthier options seemed smaller and less exciting on the plate. My verdict: Sushi Train will satisfy a sushi craving (on the cheap), and give you some novelty along the way.

"94 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,This is the first conveyor belt style sushi place I've visited thus far and truthfully the whole concept of it is pretty neat. There is a lot of convenience in being able to pick and choose from different sets of rolls and paying for them in a sort of a la carte fashion. What they do is color code the plates and then price them out at different levels depending on that color. At the table I was at one could see the chart with the colors and prices fairly easily.As far as the food quality goes the sushi was around the average for what I've had in my travels to date. I would definitely say that for the cost the sushi is a rather decent deal and it's quite easy to get a full belly without losing an arm and a leg.

There was ample California roll, and some other creepy rolls, but the standout dragon roll went by once never to be seen again.  About 30% of what was in there was some bizarre dessert concoctions that I think they served pilots before the bombing of Pearl Harbor to reinforce the idea that life was not worth living.  Thirty minutes of nothing but *blargh* rolling by and my chidren getting increasingly cranky when the waitress finally offered to have the chef make us what we were waiting for.

I would have given Sushi Train a solid 3 stars after my first lunch experience a while back.  My mistake was trying it again for dinner last night.Yeah, yeah, the sushi is on a conveyor belt and you grab what you want. Neat. Except the sushi is mediocre at best and the selection is terrible (unless you like every single sushi roll fried). And if you aren't sitting near the front of the 'train' don't count on getting anything you want during dinner.  They tell you to take the sign out and place it on your table if you want something that they're out of.   I tried that, and the inattentive waitresses noticed about 30 minutes later.  (And one of them angrily exclaimed ""GOOD LORD!"" when told by another waitress that she was about to hand us the wrong plate)IMPORTANT: BEWARE THE LETTUCE WRAPS!!  If you're picturing something on par with, or slightly cheaper quality than Pei Wei, think again.  It was basically dog food served with limp, wilted lettuce.  I still can't figure out what all was in there, but there were chunks of corn, slimy mushroom bits (i hope) and chicken that looks and tastes like it came from a Fancy Feast can.  Our first choice appetizer was edamame, but the browning, sad looking stuff on the conveyor belt made us look at the menu. Also, don't expect your appetizer to be an appetizer.  By the time we got said dog food, we had already finished everything else. Sushi Train hangs on to a second star by the skin of its teeth due to our first experience.  If you're going to brave the train, I'd recommend going early for lunch (cheaper train prices) and insisting on sitting near the front.  And dear God don't order the lettuce wraps.",Sushi Train,6153538000,188 reviews,2013-10-24,"Nashville, TN",/biz/sushi-train-nashville,2.0,103,"Washington, DC",Lisa B.

It ended up being kinda expensive for mediocre sushi, but I had a nice time. I opted to try the hot dinner meal the next time and asked our waitress for details regarding a specific tofu menu item (Ma Po) and all she could tell me was that it was a tofu dish with spicy sauce. No other details. So I went for it (was this a mistake? maybe). And, just as she told me, out came a plate with tofu and a red, gelatinous spicy sauce. It was like an entire grocery store block of medium-firm tofu chopped up on a plate with sauce. No vegetables. No frills. Just tofu. With sauce. The tofu was just heated, not pan fried or anything so it was really soft which some people may prefer, but I certainly do not. It was definitely edible. My boyfriend gave me his mushrooms from his Yang's spicy chicken to give me some texture to my mush pile. It just really wasn't my favorite, but it WAS cheap and a huge portion (comes with rice, salad and soup too!), so there's that. Additionally, I never got a water refill. The waitresses were nice and all, but really couldn't give us ANYTHING when it came to our menu questions.  The restaurant is huge, which I think might be a detriment.

"94 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"This place is cool! My wife and I have been looking for a sushi restaurant with the conveyer belt system for awhile now, as it creates a kind of novelty dining experience. We've only lived in Nashville a few months now, so when my wife saw their ad in the Scene, we jumped at the chance to eat mobile sushi. The overall atmosphere is semi intimate and somewhat communal with small tables and bright colors.The conveyer belt winds through most of the restaurant offering small plates of sushi at interval pricing. Pricing per plate also varies by lunch or dinner times. We happened to go on my wife's birthday during lunch. When we got there, there were only about 5 other people which was good, because it meant that we wouldn't have to wait long for sushi or worry about missing out by being at the end of the train. During lunch, prices range from $0.99 to $3.25. And if you go on your birthday you get $15 off if you spend $50 or more. It's quite a deal during lunch, because we had a hard time reaching $50 to begin with. My favorite thing about the train is that they offer more than just sushi on the train. They have appetizers like edamame and Asian style salads, and desserts like cheesecake and brownies. Sushi Train also offers food other than sushi. They have a menu with noodle dishes and other items. They also have tables away from the conveyer belt for larger parties.

The good thing about this is you're likely to try things you wouldn't normally try. Jalapeno, apple, steak roll for four bucks? Why not! The bad side of this is it's sushi on a conveyor belt.I'll confess I never ordered anything off of the menu. Friends of mine did and said it was very good. (The sesame tofu dish.) It takes forever for the menu food to come, which is brilliant on their part, because guess what you'll end up doing while you wait? That' s right. Eating sushi off of the conveyor belt.When the novelty wears off, check out Samurai. ;)",Sushi Train,6153538000,33 reviews,2014-01-31,"Nashville, TN",/biz/sushi-train-nashville,2.0,103,"Washington, DC",Michelle H.
"94 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"So I've been to this place four times now with mixed results but overall I would give them good marks.First the service. The servers have always been very accommodating. You can tell they are new at it but always very accommodating and friendly. A few of them need to work on their English, but their friendliness always made up for this. All but the first time I went it has had fairly good foot traffic and the first time I went was a week after it opened. Never had a bad wait except on Sunday when they had an all you can eat Sushi train.Now the food. So I have had both off the train and off the menu. All the off the menu items I thoroughly enjoyed. It's mostly Japanese with a few other Asian dishes. If you find the train off putting (your loss) you can order rolls off the menu. Definitely try their tempura banana's and ice cream for desert. Now for the train. The novelty alone makes the trip worth it. Me not being terribly patient love the fact I can sit down and be eating within minutes. I timed it, it does take about 15min for the conveyor to make one full pass but I usually find something I like after a minute or 2. The other thing I love is I can get just 3-4 pieces from 3 or 4 different rolls for the same price I could get one roll of all the same. One issue you will have though, if you come on at a time they are packed and your at the end of the train it will be hard to get something you want. I've gone on a Friday night though and was sat at about the middle and had no troubles. Go on a Sunday and get seated at the end and you'll feel like the guy who went stag to the prom. Sitting by the punch bowl hungrily eying all the rejects no one else wanted.Some are scared off by the thought of sushi sitting around, but it travels in a refrigerated tube, and last time I checked they are touting a score by the local health department of a 98. If you don't like the thought of it being in a perfectly fine REFRIGERATED tube for 30 min or so before you eat it, order a roll off the menu.",Sushi Train,6153538000,146 reviews,2013-03-25,"Nashville, TN",/biz/sushi-train-nashville,4.0,103,"Washington, DC",Corey W.
"94 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"I give them 6 months top.Tried about 5 different kinds of sushi on the sushi ""train."" It tasted like krogers sushi. Everything tastes premade and the salmon was far from sushi grade quality. Ordered my kids chicken yakitori and rice. The yakitori was huge chunks of chicken with red and green peppers on a skewer. It was more like kabobs than traditionally thin sliced teriyaki tasting yakitori. The chicken was terribly seasoned. It had hues of cinnamon and cumin, I believe. Kids wouldn't touch it and my kids love all foods, especially any type of chicken. We decided to get out while we could and ended up shelling out $30 for hardly anything- we were starving. Then as we are paying, my son projectile vomits his entire dinner everywhere. It was a terrible experience.

"94 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Horrible experience for the whole family, especially for my son.  He thought train meant ""train"", yet it was a conveyor belt of ugliness.  There's no comparison to Genki Sushi in Hawaii, where a bullet train speeds up your order in style with touch screen ordering, extremely high-tech.  This place is so lame, they outta be ashamed of how they're fooling customers...false advertising.  All the items looked dry going 'round & 'round, tasted stale.  I can only imagine the plastic screens cover some of the unfreshness, as most sushi places are served open air.  Our waiter couldn't juggle more than two tables, and forgot my son's drink.  I gave them benefit of the doubt and ordered some items off their menu and Chinese food, which I should have known any place that does Chinese & Japanese is not authentic.  I was right, everything tasted nasty, my son disliked their kung pao chicken...it didn't even taste like chicken.  My husband refused to eat, and he's Caucasian, a country cowboy who has been spoiled in SF to know the true meaning of authentic Asian food.  Yuck, yuck, yuck!!!",Sushi Train,6153538000,715 reviews,2014-05-16,"Larkspur, CA",/biz/sushi-train-nashville,1.0,103,"Washington, DC",Christine R.

"94 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Come on ride the train!  Choo choo ride it WOO WOO!So my brother and I sometimes have sushi dates and we decided to go try the train now located near Target on White Bridge Road.  It is in the old Chinese place, but even farther back in the day it used to be a Quincy's.  Yeah.  Old skooool.We had to wait for a seat near the train, but only for a few minutes.  The train is actually a glassed in, refrigerated, conveyor belt that snakes throughout the seats in the restaurant.  Just the idea of it is pretty fun.  The food is on different colored plates and the charges for each color are posted.  There are signs in the conveyor belt beside each type of sushi so you know what it is.  All you have to do is reach in and grab it.  You can also order off the menu so we got some pot stickers from there and started grabbing sushi.The pot stickers were pretty good and the sauce they came with had nice flavor.  As for the sushi...well...it is a step above Kroger sushi but it isn't going to blow your mind.  It is very average at best.  I had the basic salmon sushi, yellowtail sushi, and tuna sushi and they weren't bad but not awesome either.  The surf and turf roll was good.  Some of the rolls had fried components and it kind of lost the flavor of that since it is cold in the conveyor belt.  Some of the rolls were good, some were weird, but it was fun to just grab whatever you want at that very moment.  I suspect a lot of this is much better when ordered straight off the menu.  Plus I could have had sashimi and avoided a lot of that rice that just fills you up.  Oh, note that they do have wine/beer.  And that they bring a fortune cookie at the end of dinner (isn't that Chinese and sushi is Japanese?  No matter, I liked it.) Our waitress was sweet and quick to get our check and fill up drinks.  The manager of the joint was a sassy fun Asian girl that came over to chat with us, semi-flirt with my brother, and even offered us a beverage.  As I was already on glass 2 of chardonnay I passed.  But she was fun!Is the sushi going to blow your mind?  Not likely.  But don't overlook the novelty and FUN of the sushi train.  It's nifty.",Sushi Train,6153538000,1027 reviews,2013-01-20,"Nashville, TN",/biz/sushi-train-nashville,3.0,103,"Washington, DC",Nickie G.

We had heard about the restaurant while it was under construction, so we were excited to find out that it just opened. The atmosphere was very nice and I loved the look of the restaurant...it had its own modern uniqueness to it. The staff was very friendly and also took the time to explain the concept of conveyor belt sushi to us. I loved the variety of sushi that was offered on the conveyor belt and tried different ones, including the California Roll, the Crunchy Shrimp Roll, and the Shrimp Avocado roll. All were very tasty and fresh! One of the things I loved about the conveyor belt was that they also included a sign that showed the name of the roll and the ingredients in it. Once we were full, our waitress added up our total by the number of color-coded  plates we had (prices ranged from 99 cents to $4.00), which were quite a bit since we were very hungry, lol. They also offer traditional Japanese and Chinese food on a separate menu, which was a plus.I haven't stopped thinking about their sushi all day since we left the restaurant because it was very delicious...I hope to go back soon to try more of their food!",Sushi Train,6153538000,152 reviews,2012-11-30,"Nashville, TN",/biz/sushi-train-nashville,5.0,103,"Washington, DC",Kaleena 'Kala' H.

That was pretty neat. Like the serving style, the atmosphere was very modern too. Lots of natural textures and bright colors. Sure, the sushi isn't the best Nashville has to offer but I thought all around it was alright. Some of it was definitely Publix quality, but you'll have that. The best roll I had was some Crazy Girl roll that had eel.

"94 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"I actually signed up for a yelp account just to write this review, that's how bad it was. Being a sucker for both sushi and all things gimmicky, I had been wanting to check this place out for awhile. Finally went a couple of night ago for dinner before a night out. I can be a bit of a picky eater when it comes to certain ingredients, so I opted to order off of the menu rather than get my food off of the train. I should have known what I was in for when my miso soup came. It tasted like somebody had dumped a whole shaker of salt into it, and had only a single piece of tofu that might have been the tiniest I've ever seen.My friend ordered the tempura appetizer, and the shrimp was not tempura battered, but breaded with panko. Strangely, the veggies that came with it actually were battered, so it's probably a good indicator that the shrimp came out of a box. My boyfriend ordered some Chinese dish of chicken and broccoli, but couldn't eat it as the chicken was very undercooked. I got the Dream Roll without cucumber, and had to force myself to finish it only because I was starving and didn't have time to get food elsewhere afterwards. I kept taking out components to figure out what was making it taste so awful, but I never could pinpoint the culprit. It was all bad. I had intended on getting desert off of the train, I assumed the Oreo mouse pie was probably made elsewhere and therefore might be ok (which it was) but the waitress was really pushy about asking which one I wanted and insisted on finding it along the conveyer belt for me, rather than letting me get it myself, thus taking away even the gimmicky fun of the experience. Also, around halfway through our meal, we all noticed little bits of something floating in our water. Overall, the only good thing was the unopened bottle of nigori we ordered, but even that was overpriced.

"94 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"2013/071I'm going to buck the trend to say that I actually liked it here.Of course, my friend and I had the luxury of:a.) Time. We arrived at 4:37, a few minutes after they started their dinner service.b.) Location. We were seated near the front of the conveyer belt.c.) Attentive service. Coming in early, we didn't have to compete with other diners for the waitress' attention. She filled our waters several times.We're both from the west coast, so the novelty of ""kaiten zushi"" / conveyer belt sushi wasn't what we came here for (although I did find the conveyer belt longer than I expected it to be).  We both have husbands who don't like sushi so we decided we could go together.Although we got there early, the chefs were still rushing to get the sushi prepared. I'd say it was still a good 10-15 minutes until the conveyer belt started moving. We were in no hurry.Place is new, so it was clean. I didn't care much for the lighting -- it was too low / yellow. My vision isn't the greatest. so low lighting made the large font announcing the food slightly harder to read than it should.We both ordered miso soup from the menu, but we intended to get whatever interested us from the belt. Because they had just started dinner service, the same dishes came around about twice. By the time we left, there were definitely a lot more variety. Unfortunately for my friend, the one dish she wanted (her go-to dish) came after we had settled the bill. We were surprised that the belt started off with a lot of desserts. Maybe they were intended to be there a while. There were a lot of sushi with random fruit on top or cream cheese. And there was the traditional fare, both cold and hot. Because we were there early, I could have confidently tried the hot food; any later and I would have stuck with the cold.The belt was slow enough that you shouldn't miss what you wanted, but fast enough that the food cycled through in time for you to get what you want. I'd say the sushi was good. I still won't question where they source the fish. I've been dying for sushi that I didn't care. Overall, because we were able to get (mostly) what we wanted and got out within 45 minutes, it was an enjoyable experience. Perhaps this review would be reduced by a star had we come in after 5.

"94 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"I am not afraid to admit that I enjoy a good gimmick with my meal, so here is your third star, Sushi Train.  If the spectacle of conveyor belt sushi is alluring to you, as well, and you find yourself here, my advice would be to find a seat in the first third of the line, preferably somewhere that gives you ample time to make your decisions as the plates approach, but also a wide selection.  Take what you like and enjoy the disappointment of those further down the line when their favorite dishes are already snatched up.The sushi tastes fine, except for the Surf and Turf roll, which I thought was above average yummy, with a good marriage of beef, apple, jalapeno, and seafood.  The steak was especially nice, with a light torching on the outside and a rareness on the inside that made it go along nicely with the texture of the sushi roll.Alas, my sushi math--which consists of adding red plate plus blue plate plus yellow, etc., then subtracting the total from the amount you intended to spend on dinner, then calculating the velocity of the approaching train car of tamago and factoring that against the statistical probability and length of time until you will see it again in the next sushi cycle--is not especially good, so I ended up spending more than I typically would on sushi that was not as tasty as I would typically expect it to be.",Sushi Train,6153538000,18 reviews,2013-08-13,"Austin, TX",/biz/sushi-train-nashville,3.0,103,"Washington, DC",Matt S.

"94 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Ok, so I noticed that whatever this used to be (it escapes me...was it Chinese?) had suddenly turned into something called Sushi Train when I was running over to Target on my lunch break one day. I was like ""and so close to Sonobana?"" The only reason I even noticed it is because the building that housed Calhoun's is gone and you can see in that direction now. I remember thinking ""Well, I'll look that up on Yelp later and see what other braver-than-me people are saying."" I'm very particular about sushi...if it's a new place I want other people to have tried it first. So, thanks, all who have written reviews before me. AnywayIt was the Friday before Christmas, and my husband and I actually had the same day off of work (you'd think that since I'm off for a whole week every other week this would happen more often, but it doesn't). We had already had cheeseburgers from Hoss's Loaded Burgers for breakfast-starting the day off right and all that-and we were trying to decide what to do for lunch (to give you a time frame, breakfast was at 1 in the afternoon, so it was about 6:30 when we were trying to decide this). I suggested this place because my husband has always been enamored of kaiten sushi bars as was beyond excited when I told him we had one now. We hopped in the car and made the trek from Smyrna to White Bridge Road. Since it was the Friday before Christmas, I don't know if the crowd there was indicative of a normal Friday night crowd, but it wasn't that busy. The hostess told us it would be about 20 minutes. We were seated in under 10 minutes. We got lucky and got the two seats at the very beginning of the conveyor belt...as in, we were the first ones to see what was coming around. It doesn't take much to excite me. As mentioned in previous reviews, the plates are different colors, and each color is for a different price. Off the top of my head, red is $4.00 (the most expensive) and light blue is the cheapest ($1, I think). When you see something you want, lift the door and grab it. I was elated to find out that the conveyor belt was covered and refrigerated. I have a thing about people potentially breathing on my food. I want as little of it done as possible. I can't stand buffets. Also, no hot sushi. Yay! I'm getting off track...You can have your meal two ways: order off the menu (you can get larger sushi rolls, noodle dishes, rice dishes, appetizers, etc) or grab your whole meal off the conveyor belt. My husband and I had the bright idea that to save money we were going to order something off the menu and then 'supplement' it with a couple of plates of sushi a piece. Yeah...don't do that. After I saw all of the different kinds of sushi go by, that's all I wanted. I think I ate one noodle out of my plate of chicken udon (I didn't like it very much, either...but I think it was me, not the noodles). We ended up grabbing like 8 plates of sushi. I recommend the 'Crazy Girl' roll. It's a $4 one, but it's worth it. There was one roll that looked very interesting, but we were too chicken to try it. I think it was called 'Surf and Turf,' and it had several types of fish and green apple. Their Spider roll is good as well. There was also one called the Naruto roll that went around right when we sat down, but by the time that part of the belt came back to us it was all gone. We waited for it the entire time we were eating and for about 30 minutes afterward. Finally my husband mentioned it to our server, and she was like ""Oh, I can tell them to make it for you!"" So if there's ever something you're craving or wanting to try and you don't see it, just ask for it. The roll was on the conveyor belt in less than 5 minutes, and it was well worth the ""if we had known to ask for it"" wait. Long story short: we loved it. It's a fun thing to do for date night.

"94 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Finally, a kaiten sushi bar closer to home. What was once a ho-hum asian buffet is now an awesome sushi restaurant featuring conveyer belt sushi! The prices for any given plate range from 99 cents (for an all veggie roll), to $4.00.My fiancee and I waited for what seemed like forever for this place to open, and when it did we were not disappointed. They have a great variety of sushi rolls and even some nigiri that circulate on the enclosed, chilled, conveyor. All you do is lift up the door next to your table, and reach in and grab what you want. I will say that this place just barely makes 5 stars as some of the rolls fell apart (never a good thing); but they make up for it with the variety and the fact that each line of sushi is preceded by a sign traveling on the conveyor telling you what type of sushi is next. Their spicy salmon and tuna rolls were amazing as were the regular ones. I did not find one bad roll on the line.So bring your money, cause it can add up really fast, and a big appetite, you will not be disappointed.

The train is novel. The sushi is just fine, but not stellar. And expensive. Seats are hard to get because everyone is excited about a train of sushi. If you, like me, ignore these reviews and go because this place has the market cornered on trains of sushi in Nashville, then here are your tips.Go early on a weeknight. If you have to wait, ask the hostess for a drink menu and someone will come by and take your drink order. When you get to the train, you'll be tempted to take a familiar roll (like salmon and cucumber), because you're hungry. Be patient. Sushi Train doesn't do basic rolls better than your favorite sushi place (and your favorite sushi place is Ginza, right??), so don't waste your money on them. Instead, wait for the specialty rolls to come around and get the surf and turf. In fact, get all of the surf and turf rolls you see. This is the one shining gem of sushi train. The uncommon ingredients blend to a bright and pleasant flavor twist on typical sushi. If I were forced to return this place, I'd sit at a non-train table and order this roll, even though I stick to bonafide legitimate japanese sushi at other restaurants (If you tell me you usually order pansy-ass crazy fried rolls, I have stopped reading your reviews).choo choo, nashville.",Sushi Train,6153538000,119 reviews,2013-01-17,"Austin, TX",/biz/sushi-train-nashville,3.0,103,"Washington, DC",Micheal P.

"94 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"I'm so glad a kaiten sushi place opened in Nashville!!  I'm a big fan of the whole conveyor belt idea.  And I have high hopes for Sushi Train.First, the interior: pleasant, simple decor.  The belt is the longest I've seen, and features both tables and counter space.  There are lots of tables, which I really prefer; I like to face the people I'm talking to!  There are attractive soy sauce dispensers on the tables (NOT just the bottles the sauce came in & no ads for the maker on the container, a nice touch).  I do wish they'd provide both regular & low-sodium soy sauce; I think regular soy sauce sort of mugs all the other flavors.  I'm sure they'd provide it if I asked.Ok, on to the sushi itself: Yeah.  It's good.  There's a variety of rolls, and the rolls themselves are not too large.  Small rolls would seem to be a minus, but not to me.  I don't like those palm-sized rolls that you can't eat in one bite & that fall apart in your hand.  This does not happen here.  The little cards on the belt are a plus, as they not only name the roll & what's in it, they also indicate whether the roll contains raw or cooked fish.  Thus, sushi beginners can feel confident in their picks.  The rolls are well constructed, too.  Oh, and they have a menu with both more sushi choices and Japanese & Chinese entrees, so if your group includes those who won't eat sushi at all, they're covered too.Prices: reasonable!  The most expensive plate is $4.Minuses, and they are very minor ones: I'd like to see more nigiri sushi on the belt.  The tuna nigiri I snagged was yummy, give me more!  Like surf clam...masago...red snapper...mmm.  Oh, and the belt had lots of empty space, they need to work on keeping it reasonably filled....but hey, they just opened, I'm sure they're still getting the kinks out.  All in all: please, please mob this place!  I've noticed that the busier a kaiten sushi place is, oddly enough, the better the quality & variety.  And I definitely think Sushi Train is up to the challenge.",Sushi Train,6153538000,67 reviews,2012-12-01,"Mt Juliet, TN",/biz/sushi-train-nashville,4.0,103,"Washington, DC",Cara P.

I noticed near the end of the meal that more seemed to be coming through but it was a little late by then.It would have been nice if there had been signs or something telling what was what. You just had to be familiar enough with sushi to know what you were eating. I actually ordered off the menu, while the others did the all-you-can-eat thing. The sushi is fine, but very basic.

"94 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"A missed flight lead to an unexpected solo adventure day in Nashville (the kind of day in which a full-time resident can trick himself into feeling like a tourist).  So for dinner, I headed over to Sushi Train, with high expectations (I mean this in a genuine way, I left the big city version of me that might've scoffed at conveyor belt sushi in a strip mall at home).  I was excited by the idea of grabbing what I want, when I need it,  going at my own pace, a phenomenon usually reserved for traditional buffets (but let's be honest, there is nothing too 'personal' or intimate about the pace of life in such establishments).  As for the food, I was impressed by the mix of standards (pork gyoza appetizer, salmon roll, an incredibly fresh yellow tail sashimi) and the more exotic and inventive, such as a roll with tuna, apple, and jalepeno, which wasn't actually spicy but had a really bright fruity pop to it that I would've expected to taste at Las Paletas.  The value is there--if you're careful.  The better looking options are usually found on red plates ($4 each), with the enticing $1.25 price point reserved for simpler fare such as the asparagus roll (I didn't indulge).  I would recommend getting an appetizer or entree to supplement the conveyor belt options--just the pork gyoza for me--however, I imagine the temptation to grab many little colorful plates would still be there.  The stomach seems to trick the mind more at sushi restaurants than at most, I've found, and thus the little stack of empty plates builds ever higher, until some kid of will power says enough.  I will be going back, next time bringing some comrades with whom to fight over who gets the last piece of spicy tuna.",Sushi Train,6153538000,1 review,2012-12-22,"Nashville, TN",/biz/sushi-train-nashville,4.0,103,"Washington, DC",Jason H.

"2501 Gallatin AveNashville, TN 37206",4.5,"For me, Dolls was just alright. I ordered the fried tilapia plate that came with 2 sides and cornbread. My husband ordered the whiting plate. The girl working the front seemed really disinterested in helping us. She told us it would be 10 minutes on the fish, which was fine by us, so we paid and had a seat at a booth. The interior of the restaurant is not anything to write yelp about. They did have a pool table across the dining room though. Anyway, our fish came out and she seemed to dilly dally around while it sat in the boxes in the window. She finally grabbed them and we walked to the counter as she added our requested sides of mac & cheese and mashed potatoes. I asked her if they had cornbread and she said it would be another 4 minutes because they would have to cook them. I asked her if it was included with our meals (it said it was on the menu board) and she said yes but they would have to cook them because they didn't have any made up. If they knew our meals came with cornbread that takes 4 minutes to cook and we ordered fish that takes 10 minutes to cook, I'm confused as to why it wasn't made while the fish was cooking. Oh well, we didn't get cornbread. We got home and made corn and green beans (their corn looked really, really over cooked) and we ate. The fish was fine. It was seasoned and lightly breaded. The sides were good but needed a little extra seasoning.

It only takes a few minutes, and you don't have to chop anything or think about dinner too hard. There's just me and one other person eating the food, and we always have plenty of leftovers for another two or three meals, depending on how hearty the food it.

"1500 2nd Avenue SouthNashville, TN 37210",4.5,"I am in LOVE with this service. It has made my life so incredibly simple, and the food is delicious. I had been eyeing Blue Apron and Plated for months, but something always kept me from ordering. My Veggie Chef showed up in my Facebook news feed as a sponsored advertisement. I would usually scroll right over the sponsored ads, but it got my attention. My husband and I are not vegetarians or vegans, but we do try to limit our meat consumption, and it is a challenge for me to come up with creative vegetarian recipes. My Veggie Chef does a wonderful job of making great meals easy. They are usually all-in-one type dishes, but they don't get old because the flavors are so unique. I love the international flare they have in their menu. Lots of Indian and Mexican inspiration, which my husband and I love. The only 2 reasons I took away 1 star is the food does not arrive in refrigerated boxes like some of the bigger services. Luckily, I ended up being home for our delivery, but 12-6 PM, is a big window, much like waiting for the cable guy.... The bag was insulated, but I wonder how long it would last if you weren't home to receive it. They suggest you leave a cooler filled with ice if you won't be home, which is a pain to me, so I don't order on weeks I know we can't be present when it is delivered.  The other reason I removed 1 star is all essential ingredients aren't always included. It's not common, but if a recipe requires non-dairy milk or an avocado, I still have to go to the grocery store which defeats the purpose of this service. It would be nice if they included all necessary ingredients. (Other than oil, salt and pepper. Those are definitely essentials.)Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this service, and I will definitely continue to use them. I'm proud they are local too!",My Veggie Chef,6152008638,141 reviews,2015-10-01,"Nashville, TN",/biz/my-veggie-chef-nashville,4.0,15,"Washington, DC",Tyler B.
"1500 2nd Avenue SouthNashville, TN 37210",4.5,"I love this service.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I used to be (for 10 years) and I still love vegetarian food.  My Veggie Chef is very easy to use.  They publish the menu for the next week 10 days or so in advance; you sign up for delivery (usually with a $10 early bird coupon if you sign up by Sunday night; the deadline to sign up for Sunday delivery is Wednesday); and the next Sunday, they drop off your food, frozen in Ziploc bags.  The amount of cooking required on your part is minimal: sometimes just reheating everything together in a pot, sometimes you have to cook some rice, pasta or quinoa separately and add to the rest of the dish, which also has to be reheated, so you will dirty a couple of pots/pans.  The food is delicious and it's definitely enough for 4 meals. A prior reviewer commented on high sodium, but that wasn't the case for my meals; each serving was ~400-500 mg sodium, which is slightly less than in most calorie-equivalent frozen dinners and keeps you well under the AHA-recommended 2300 mg/day. Nutritional info, including calories/carbs/fat/protein/sodium/fiber, is provided, which is a plus. They also have a gluten-free menu each week, and since it's vegan, everything is dairy free.I would recommend the service to anyone, vegetarian or not (hey, you could always add some protein - chicken, fish, etc. - while you're reheating and still save yourself a ton of time in the kitchen). The only downside for me is that the delivery window is kind of big: between 12 and 6 pm on Sundays.  You can leave a cooler on the porch if you're not going to be home, but it would be nice if they could give you a narrower window the morning of delivery when they have their routes (12-2, 2-4 or 4-6, nothing too rigid).  I wanted to go for a walk this afternoon and felt kind of tied to the house. Just my 2 cents.  Still love the service!",My Veggie Chef,6152008638,71 reviews,2015-09-20,"Nashville, TN",/biz/my-veggie-chef-nashville,4.0,15,"Washington, DC",Briana P.
"1500 2nd Avenue SouthNashville, TN 37210",4.5,"I've ordered My Veggie Chef on three occasions so far. PROS: The delivery is consistent on Sundays with friendly drivers, the recipes are easy to follow, and if I ever have a question or problem, the owner is quick to respond. The serving sizes are listed for 2-3, and in my house there is enough for both of us to have lunches the next day. If you sign up for the newsletter you can see the menu before you order. The website sometimes has a $10 coupon for liking on Facebook or whatever.CONS:  It can be a pricey to pay $87 for 5 meals upfront, The first time I ordered I thought I might be able to do better. Most of the dishes are based on legumes and whole grains. But the fact is, I don't make the time to plan and prep and therefore end up eating the kids' leftover mac n cheese instead of something thoughtfully planned like Veggie Chef. Second, the food isn't all organic. When I asked the owner about it, she told me that she tries to buy as much organic as possible within her budget, and to avoid the ""dirty dozen"" as conventional veggies. I thought this was a problem so I tried to do the ""Fresh20"" vegan meal planning service instead, and buy all organic ingredients. I spent twice as much and still had to do all the prep work. Then I threw half the food away because I only used a portion of it or I was too busy to cook.  At least with veggie chef, the meals are safe in the freezer until I decide to cook them.VERDICT: I would definitely recommend trying it out for anyone that wants to ""beef up"" their veggie intake.",My Veggie Chef,6152008638,23 reviews,2015-01-15,"Nashville, TN",/biz/my-veggie-chef-nashville,5.0,15,"Washington, DC",Jena G.
"1500 2nd Avenue SouthNashville, TN 37210",4.5,"The term ""chef"" implies most of the work is done for you, and that the most you'll need to do is some simple reheating...NOT the case at all.  My veggie ""shopper"" would be a better term.We ordered a week of these meals for our convenience, to save time, and ended up spending far MORE time preparing these meals than the 15-20 mins claimed on the website.   Ingredients are pre-measured, but that's about it.   The quality of the ingredients isn't all that great, IMHO, and certainly doesn't justify the price when it's not all organic, etc.  As far as seasonings go, they're a 1 stop shop - SALT, SALT, and more SALT.  Several of these dishes were too salty to eat.  So I guess if you don't know how to go shopping and have unlimited cooking times (e.g. no kids or don't work and/or aren't looking to get a meal ready in less than 30-60 mins), this is for you.",My Veggie Chef,6152008638,8 reviews,2015-01-15,"Nashville, TN",/biz/my-veggie-chef-nashville,1.0,15,"Washington, DC",Michael M.
"1500 2nd Avenue SouthNashville, TN 37210",4.5,"I would really like to rate MVC 5 stars because of the concept, quality of the product for the value, friendly delivery lady, and ease of preparation... However, out of the five meals we received, the only one I would want to have again was the buffalo tempeh with greens and ranch dressing. It was really awesome the first time as well as reheated leftovers. The ranch dressing was incredibly watery but I guess that's my fault for adding the maximum suggested amount of liquid right off the bat. I also felt like there was the least amount of food in this dish out of all the meals. We only got about 3 ""adult servings"" out of the tempeh but felt like the included rice was beyond plentiful. But that would really be my only complaint for that dish. I wish that we had been able to order 5 days worth of it. Ha. Otherwise, none of the other meals were super impressive to me and I actually thought the one pot mac and cheese was kinda gross. I didn't finish that one. I had high hopes for my veggie chef, this particular menu especially, but I don't love it enough to order again. I will say that I do think $90 + tax ($108) for one week of vegan and gluten free dinner and leftover lunch the following day is a really good deal. You can also get $10 off for ordering early.

I zip around our fair city all the time and dining out can rack up some charges because I am super awkward in my kitchen. With My Veggie Chef, I come home and have a Vegan prepped meal ready to go. I usually just need to add some water and olive oil to a pan and do simple preparations that even I can complete. This past week, I enjoyed a delightful Aloo Gobi entree, Chili-Lime Tofu Tacos with Black Bean and Corn Salsa, Pasta Puttanesca, Seitan, Mushroom and Pineapple Stir Fr, and Creole Red Beans and Rice. Everything was filling and very tasty. The dishes come with suggestions for great side item pairings (your on your own to purchase and prepare) that have included items such as Coconut Rice, Sesame Green Beans, and Garlicky Broccoli.A few things that I would love to see get updated:Notate on the packaging what the nutritional information is for each entree.The Zip-Loc bags could used to contain the entrees an upgrade too. What can I say? I am all about the packaging and the entree bags didn't showcase the quality of the food and didn't make My Veggie Chef look like a professional operation. If the cost of packaging is the reason, perhaps offering an incentive program for consumers who return their packaging each week would help keep costs down?The once a week delivery is between 3-7pm on Sundays and include a My Veggie Chef Cooling bag.As someone who used to be on the Seattle Sutton food delivery service (very costly) and the food is pre-made with 2 deliveries a week, My Veggie Chef is priced fair and will likely be something that I will continue to use in 2012.

I literally had to turn the flashlight on my phone on so I could read both the menu and the check.  Second, if you order a sandwich, the sides are À la carte.  I was frustrated by what was basically ""French Fry Gravel"" but the waitress didn't charge me for it after I pointed it out.

"4041 Armory Oaks DrNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"This was my first time at a Raffertys, and the experience was rather unpleasant.I went here with a rather large group from work for a casual lunch meeting. We were told we'd be seated in fifteen minutes or so and ended up waiting an hour. Now I totally understand that it can often take a while to seat large parties, but just be honest about it. If it's going to take an hour, say it's going to take an hour. People have schedules to keep.We had an appetizer of fried pickles and they were decently good. The sauce they were served with was tasty, and the breading was nicely done. In fact, these pickles were the only positive thing about my experience, and the only reason I'm giving this place two stars instead of one.My actual lunch left much to be desired. I ordered the french dip sandwich, which is usually a safe bet at restaurants because they're simple, delicious (usually) and hard to screw up. Unfortunately, the prime rib they used was rather awful. It was a rather unattractive grey color, there were way too many big globs of fat (it seemed to compose about half the sandwich), and the parts that weren't pure fat were tough. At least the bread it was served on was good; I ended up pulling most of the meat out and having the bread for lunch. Several of my coworkers ordered this sandwich as well, and they were all equally as disappointed. I'm a big french dip fan; I love good ones and I even enjoy mediocre ones. For me to think that one is bad, it has to be *really* bad. The fries that accompanied the sandwich weren't much better; limp and soft. Their menu actually goes as far as to have a sidebar bragging about how their fries are cut just before cooking to make them extra-super-tasty and whatnot, so one would think that they'd be more particular about the quality. I tried a couple and didn't really touch them beyond that.One of my coworkers ordered a bowl of the potato soup and remarked that it was completely devoid of potatoes. It was just a bowl of creamy soup base with some cheese and a bit of bacon on top. Now I've been told by multiple people that there is good food to be had here, so maybe they were having an off day or perhaps they just make lousy french dips. Either way, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and try the restaurant again sometime, and update my review accordingly if I'm actually able to eat what I'm served.",Raffertys Restaurant & Bar,6152799660,62 reviews,2013-10-22,"Murfreesboro, TN",/biz/raffertys-restaurant-and-bar-nashville,2.0,45,"Washington, DC",Leigh M.

"4041 Armory Oaks DrNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"Not that impressed with this place. I've been here a few times and each time I wasn't knocked out with the food. It's average at best and I feel like their menu is limited. I've always felt like it was a struggle to find something good to order. What I mean is... do you know how when you go to a restaurant and you have several things that catch your eye and have to pick between a couple appealing options? Well, here I feel the exact opposite. I feel like I struggle to find just one that sounds good. Very meh. Kinda like a bland hotel room service menu at best. The servers have always been nice and attentive, so no complaints there. Lots of nice flat screen TVs around, so maybe a decent place to just go drink a lot of beer and eat finger food appetizers while enjoying a game of your favorite team.",Raffertys Restaurant & Bar,6152799660,108 reviews,2011-01-04,"Brentwood, TN",/biz/raffertys-restaurant-and-bar-nashville,2.0,45,"Washington, DC",Travis A.

"4041 Armory Oaks DrNashville, TN 37204",3.5,"This was my first, and last, visit to this Nashville restaurant.  My husband and I had been to the Rafferty's in Bowling Green, KY once before, and though we weren't crazy about it then, we decided to give Rafferty's another shot and ended up at this one. First let me say that the staff were all great.  Very friendly, very attentive and very quick to refill drinks (even when we didn't want a refill).  For an appetizer, we ordered the croissants that come with honey butter, with chopped pecans.  The croissants themselves tasted great.  However, the honey/butter proportion was way off.  The honey was very overpowering.  For our entrees, I got the BBQ chicken breast with broccoli, add a salad; my husband got the half rack of ribs/chicken tenders platter with loaded fries.  My food basically had no flavor.  It really seemed like the chefs had lost/were out of all of their spices, including simple salt and pepper.  The broccoli had no flavor, the cheese had no flavor, the garlic ranch salad dressing might as well have been water, because it had absolutely no flavor whatsover.  The BBQ sauce was the most flavorful thing on my plate, and it was a bit too sweet for my taste.  My husband's chicken tenders were similarly without flavor, but he did enjoy his ribs and fries.  We also ordered the White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie to split for dessert.  It was just ok.  The graham cracker crust was good, but the pie itself was, much like the rest of the food here, rather flavorless.Most times, I believe in the ""3 strikes, you're out"" policy, but with Rafferty's, I'm afraid it's 2 strikes and never returning.  We could have gone just about anywhere and have gotten a much more flavorful meal for less money than we paid here.",Raffertys Restaurant & Bar,6152799660,10 reviews,2012-02-25,"Nashville, TN",/biz/raffertys-restaurant-and-bar-nashville,2.0,45,"Washington, DC",Jaime T.

Got my entree in reasonable time, presentation of the food was boring, kinda sloppy, and my shells was swimming in a plate full of spaghetti sauce which by the way was NOT good. It would have been much better to pour a little of the sauce over the shells instead of sitting them in the sauce to drown, and maybe a parsley sprig on the side would have been nice.

"2121 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"The pizza and the restaurant had several issues. They got the crust right, which is the hardest part of the pizza to get right in my opinion. It is the foundation of any pizza. It was light, crispy and thin. Then they messed up the rest of it. They didn't put enough cheese on it. They're trying to be fancy and put little circles of mozzarella on it but the mozzarella isn't high quality enough to justify putting that small amount of cheese on it. The lack of cheese then threw off the rest of the pizza. The pizza needed the salt from the mozzarella to balance it out and i had to doctor it with salt and garlic powder to make it taste decent. The rice ball was tasty and it with the good crust were the highlights of the meal. Another disappointment was they're facebook page is covered with photos of delicious looking pastries and i get there and they don't have any. I was told they don't really make pastries in the summer because it gets too hot. That doesn't make any sense at all. Bakeries would be closed half the year, get some a/c.

I couldn't have been happier and my clean plate verified that! Some of my fellow diners noshed on pizza, eggplant parm, and other pasta dishes while I was already curious to try a sandwich for an upcoming lunch.I also loved that I was able to bring in my own bottle of vino that we guzzled while we played UNO with the Savarino family for hours.... literally one of the best times that I have had in a long time.

"2121 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"Went to Savarino's for the first time last week - I had the Ed Pontieri sandwich (mortadella, sopressata, cappicolla, provolone, lettuce, tomato, bomba calabrese)  and my father had the Mollini sandwich (chicken, prosciutto, fresh mozzarella roasted peppers.) Both were excellent and arrived within 15 minutes. The staff was friendly and my father liked the fact that they had his favorite Sicilian red wine. I really liked the bread the sandwiches were made with, the fresh greens served on top and the bomba calabrese (a spicy sauce that was basted below the cold cuts.)So fast forward to this week - we were in the mood for more Savarinos, we got there at 7:50 pm and the owner turned us away at the door, saying that they closed at 8. So when is 7:50 the same as 8 o'clock and besides that what self-respecting owner would close their restaurant at 8 pm? So subtract one star for apathy, three star restaurant.______________I'd like to edit this review somewhat because I forgot some important details. On the original trip we went in and were somewhat confused by the seating and ordering process. Fortunately there were some diners that noted our confusion and told us that more items were on the actual menu (as opposed to the sign.) They also told us where to place our order.Next to the ordering spot was the ""bar"" - it seemed to be fully stocked with Italian wines and liquors but lacked seating (so was it really a bar?) The dessert station was underwhelming - the cooler was empty and the gelato tins were 75% empty.  I also noticed a lot of dirty tables when we came in - the owner and another employee came out and bussed the tables.

"2121 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"I had seen Savarino's on the Food Channel and determined to try to start supporting them, especially since I live so close. I went to buy some good Italian cookies about 4:00 on a Saturday afternoon. They were VERY low on cookies, which wasn't a big concern for me as their Tira Misu looked fabulous. While I was there I figured I would give their pizza a shot. I'm from CT, so I'm used to really good pizza--a slice wih cheese only. IMO, Pizza Perfect is the absolute best Pizza in Nashville.  At Savarino's I asked if they served slices, and they said they just had to heat it. It took quite a while to heat the slices. I ordered the Tira Misu and one chocolate chip cookie, eventually got the slices, and went home. Once home the pizza was VERY disappointing. Big globs of cheese--didn't seem to be mozarella, though that is hard to find on pizza anywhere in Nashville. I did not like the sauce at all, and the crust was a bit soggy. The Tira Misu was good, and cookie--not so much.They seem like such nice people--a family restaurant, and I so wanted it to be good. I did notice that the reviews seem to be either really positive, or really negative. Maybe it's a matter of what you order, or when you order, or a little of both, but that's too risky a proposition for me.",Savarino’s Cucina,6154609878,3 reviews,2014-12-06,"Nashville, TN",/biz/savarinos-cucina-nashville,2.0,91,"Washington, DC",Claudia R.

"2121 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"With a daughter's wedding coming up and me being Sicilian, and new in town, we'd heard the rave reviews abt this place. One wedding tradition we have is trays of Italian cookies on the guests's tables, so we went to try the bakery. When we entered, it was very confusing bc there was no way of knowing what to do or where to stand and there was no one around to offer help. The place is dingey and unkempt and makes you wonder what they do to maintain their investment.  I also wondered: if this is what I see, what abt what I can't see? Kind of a stomach-rolling feeling.Oddly, for a restaurant, there were no scents or aromas, though there were ppl eating. I had to think abt how they could, given the lack of atmosphere.After a while a young lady came out and we explained ourselves to her, she went in the rear to tell someone and she came back to tell us that she would be giving us 3 of each kind to try, which sounded great. To get cannoli, I had to go to another case and talk to a man, personality-optional. What is it with Italian men? So much arrogance! Too much mama-doting. Glad I married otherwise! He had 1 or 2 made,, so we got 1 to try/buy and it was ok!While I asked the man some questions regarding the wedding, the girl made the box of cookies.  We brought home 3 lbs., to share with the bride and groom and the maid of honor, etc.,  When we opened our box there were so many different kinds, BUT, the cookies were disappointing bc each one was either singed black around the edges and tips or totally black on the bottom. Truthfully, not one cookie was well-baked. So, I ask you...if you knew this was for potential bigger business, wouldn't  you serve your very best? But if this IS your very best, shouldn't you be embarrassed? We did not contract with them. We flew-in cookies from Ferrara's  Bakery of Little Italy in NYC!!  Abbonddanza!!!

"2121 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"So I guess I belong to the group that was not impressed by this place.  This is a family restaurant, and many seem to argue that the long wait is part of the experience.  I say that is fine, if the food was that special and impressive-otherwise, I wish you well but I am going to eat somewhere else.  I have been here three times, and I have never waited less than 30 minutes to receive my meal; once, it took a full hour with no one else waiting for anything. Can you really be THAT slow?Savarino's serves a fairly Americanized Southern Italian cuisine with the usual sandwiches and pasta. The sandwiches were good, with some nice cuts of salami and other sausages, but they had a bad habit of arriving cold. They are also a bit on the expensive side, around $7-8 per 6-in sandwich, though they are still in the reasonably priced.  In summary, it is a fairly average Italian restaurant with a slow enough wait that knocks it down.  Or maybe I'm just biased, having enjoyed some good Italian sandwich shops in North Beach.  Since people can't seem to agree about this place, decide for yourself.  Or don't.     I should mention that there was also an impressive large and tasty-looking pastry display, which I admit I have never tried.

"2121 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"I have to preface this review by saying I haven't actually eaten here, but I want to SO badly!  The menu looks fantastic and I was really looking forward to trying it.  I am only writing this review to warn others about the nature of the service since it seems so out of the ordinary.My husband and I arrived at Savarino's at 6:30 on a Saturday night, waited at the counter while looking at the menu.  Finally after about 5 minutes a waitress came out of the kitchen to let us know ""it's going to be an hour and 45 minute wait"".  I have no problem waiting a reasonable amount of time for good food, but an hour and 45 minutes for a SANDWICH?  Do they bake the bread to order? (The waitress also acted like an hour and 45 minutes was totally normal.)All the tables were full, but there weren't that many tables to begin with, so I just don't understand how it could take an hour and 45 minutes for a sandwich unless they literally just have one person cooking.I am hoping someday to be able to try Savarino's since the menu looks great but I might just try to call it in ahead of time and get it to go.  Seems like a crapshoot if you actually want to walk in and be seated to eat.",Savarino’s Cucina,6154609878,8 reviews,2011-01-24,"Nashville, TN",/biz/savarinos-cucina-nashville,2.0,91,"Washington, DC",Charlene F.

"2121 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"Not coming back! Expect a super long wait!My Wife and I saw Savarino's on Diners, Drive-ins & Dives and got excited when we saw it was located here in Nashville. We live in Franklin, but made the small trip to downtown Nashville just to eat at Savarino's. Being a Saturday, free parking in the area was filled up, so we parked in the paid parking, which is like $3.00 an hour. We only paid for only an hour thinking there is no way we would be in Savarino's longer than that.But boy were we wrong! We simply ordered two sandwiches and we literally had to wait over 50 minutes for them! Then when we got them, I expected them to taste like heaven for that long of a wait, but instead it was something barely better than you could get at Subway. Our meal was over $20 Dollars for two sandwiches and two waters.While we were waiting for our sandwhiches, I had to go back and pay for another hour of parking, so I ended up spending $6.00 dollars in parking. I know the parking situation isn't necessarily Savarino's fault and it comes with the territory, but the main issue is having to wait over 50 minutes for just two semi-ok sandwhiches.Everyone around us was getting mad about their orders taking forever as well. An old couple near us who also ordered two sandwiches asked the rather large lady who works at the register, why it takes almost an hour for two sandwiches, and she just replied in an rude manner ""it's first come first serve!"" and then walked away from them.We were really disappointed with Savarino's and we don't plan on coming back. I really think they have big heads now that they have been on TV and they think they can treat customers like crap and still get our business!PROS-It was on TV?CONS-Wait time (Horrible!)-Number of tables-Rude employees-Food is overhyped",Savarino’s Cucina,6154609878,46 reviews,2011-02-06,"San Francisco, CA",/biz/savarinos-cucina-nashville,1.0,91,"Washington, DC",Steven S.
"2121 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"Some friends who moved here from New York turned me on to Savarino's. The sandwiches are awesome, and I really haven't experienced the long wait that other Yelpers complain about anytime I've been there. Or maybe that's because I haven't been there much since Guy Fieri let the world in on our secret. The family style dishes are also amazing. Eggplant parmigiana? Rice balls? Be still my heart. For some reason, the individual orders never stack up to the family style orders. The last time I got a single order eggplant parmigiana there, it was swimming in greasy sauce (but still tasty). The family style eggplant parm doesn't seem to have that problem. Don't waste your money on a side salad, it's just a bowl of iceberg lettuce and some bottled dressing for a pretty solid upcharge (Not sure how much, since it wasn't listed on the menu. I just know it made my $7.95 order leap to $12-something after taxes). Ah, but the sandwiches. And the cannoli. I'm not a meat eater, but I'm sure the sandwiches with meat are even better (hey, it's Italian food. I'm not above admitting that). Go for a lunch and get a sandwich. Any sandwich.

"2121 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"Let me preface this review by sharing my qualifications: I'm a New Haven girl born of Sicilian ancestry. I know my Italian food, both at home at Mama's and when I go out for a pie or a grinder.That being said, Savarino's wouldn't be in business 2 weeks if it was up north. But because there's literally no other place like it in town, they do well. I've given them plenty of chances...for both lunch and dinner, on weekdays and weekends, and the result is always the same. The slow service is just the tip of the iceberg. They've gotten orders completely wrong when they aren't even busy. I'm saying not even close... chicken when you order eggplant wrong. For a time, their grinders had shrunk to downright small, however last time I visited they were a good size again so gold star for you guys. One time, I swung by for dinner with some visiting northerners, and they were closed at 6:30...when the door clearly said 8. No note on the door, no nothing. Not how you should run a business.On top of it all, the food is ok. Not great. Pretty standard, but I guess it's exotic to Nashville. I've had a handful of the sandwiches, never any pasta/salad/soup. So maybe I'm missing out. Also, they never have pignoli cookies :( They are my favorite.

"2121 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"We gave this place a try because Guy Fieri had come here on an episode of Triple-D and he gave it a positive review.We ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana Sandwich.  It came on homemade bread.  The bread was good, but the sandwich as a whole was pretty much ordinary.The deserts (on display in a bakery style case) were completely unappetizing looking.  The Gelato had crystallized ice on it, and most of the baked goods had clearly been in the oven too long.  So, despite being desert-driven people, we opted to skip desert.Just before leaving, my wife headed to the restroom were she found the most disgusting facilities she has ever seen.  A Porta Potti at any construction site would be an improvement over what she encountered here.  Are these the same bathrooms that employees ""clean up"" in before returning to work?  Do they use the same level of detail when maintaining cleanliness standards in the kitchen?If she had used the facilities prior to ordering we would have left immediately.",Savarino’s Cucina,6154609878,4 reviews,2012-11-16,"Bolingbrook, IL",/biz/savarinos-cucina-nashville,1.0,91,"Washington, DC",Robert T.

It was a little over cooked not too bad though. The sausage was definitely the best part of this sandwich. Unfortunately, after the chef added the red wine to the sandwich ingredients, he let it reduce for too long which gave the ingredients a bitter flavor. I liked the chicken parm a lot better. However, it would have been way better with a little more sauce. The bread to chicken parm ratio was far too high for the amount of sauce they put on the sandwich. I would love to go back and try dinner sometime. I would worry what dinner service would be like though. We were one of two tables in the restaurant and it took about a half hour to get two sandwiches which is just ridicules. The owner was also not very friendly. There was a younger guy working who was friendly though. Have to admit, I lost a little respect for DDD after this visit. The 3 stars is for the service. The food is 4 stars for sure.

"2121 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"We arrived in Nashville from Atlanta on Fri 6/17/11, checked in at the Opryland Hotel, then went straight to Savarino's because I was so excited to try it. I had read the reviews about the wait and was glad it was an off time (2:30). There was no one in the place which we thought was a blessing, but I don't think the young woman working the counter thought so. She was clearly not happy to see us and was beyond rude. As we began to order the phone rang and without so much as a ""pardon me"", she picked up the phone to take a to go order. We stepped away from the counter to discuss leaving, but decided since we had come so far, to see the visit through. As we reapproached she was even more irritated and rude. We placed our order at the counter, took our cans of coke from the refrig as instructed and took our seats. The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time, but was horrible. My spaghetti was swimming in a greasy glob of sauce. My husbands chicken parm was hard and chewy and his penne was in the same glob of sauce I had. Our daughter had an overtoasted bun with a couple of dry meatballs inside and NO sauce.. No one was happy. Let me also say it is difficult to eat spaghetti and chicken parm with the plastic forks and knives we were given. We considered dessert and went to look at the display. We decided to place an order, but our hostess with the mostess attitude was sitting talking in the dining room to a friend. The friend told her she had customers, but she told him we were ""just looking"". (?) Instead of correcting her, we left. So, pitifully poor rude service and overrall bad attitude, bad food, mediocre ambiance, plastic untensils, I have nothing good to say.

"2121 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"Let me just start off by saying that never have I ever been compelled to write a bad review of a restaurant before, until now. I went in on a rainy afternoon because I was craving some pasta and this is the closest Italian place to my house. I came in to eat by myself and get some homework done. A nice, but slightly invasive, older gentleman who seemingly worked at the restaurant came over and wanted to have a conversation. For the record, just because people are eating alone doesn't mean they want to have conversations with strangers. Anyways, after asking me my life story, I mentioned that I wrote for a company that works with restaurants. I was not there representing this company in any way shape or form, just as a customer. He then sent the owner over my way to talk to me about what I do. Again, did not ask for any of this. I apologized to the owner, and said I was not there trying to sell him on anything, simply to eat dinner but his friend kept asking what I did. The owner continued to tell me he felt sorry for me and that I have no future in my job. WOW! Talk about grade-a customer service! I was dining at your completely deserted restaurant, hungry and excited, and you have the nerve to come over to me, sit at my table, look me in the face and tell me you feel sorry for me because of my choice of employment? Maybe this is the reason that despite their perfect location no one has ever heard of this place. Needless to say, I asked for my food to go.

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I would give this place a 3.5.....5 for ambiance and 2 for food.Let's start with the positive first. This place is unlike any other restaurant in Nashville. Though it is a national chain, I felt like it was extremely unique. The restaurant is dimly lit and in the center of it is a huge aquarium with all sorts of sea creatures. If you go at the right time, you can see the scuba divers feeding them! Even as an adult I enjoyed sipping my martini and watching a shark haha but I can imagine that younger children would LOVE this. All the booths are the round type that face the aquarium so everyone had a chance to see it! Also the servers were wonderful. Overall everything except the food was five stars. For the negative....the food was disgusting. Like seriously horrible. Maybe my mistake was not ordering seafood? But my sister and I both ordered the chicken fettuccine pasta. The chicken was ok, but the noodles were overcooked. You know that gross pastey ragu fettuccine sauce? I remember from my broke college years. I swear that is what they used. The Alfredo sauce wasn't creamy and parmesany, it was pastey and tasted fake. It was served with what tasted like microwaved bread. We had the sampler appetizer...it was mediocre. Everything is relatively expensive. I think my pasta was like 25 bucks.

So you go there and unfortunately you pay amounts it kind of reflect not only are you in Nashville but you're in there in an aquarium restaurant in Nashville. Seems really kind of pricey. Food was decent standard American fare. Our kids really enjoyed watching the divers feed the fish but I can't say I wasn't rooting for one of those little sharks to take a little nip out of the divers finger.

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I think the best thing about this place is the aquarium itself.

My entire table of 4 were unsatisfied their meals. Probably won't be back, unless the kid wants to stop in to see the fish. I will have to say our server was very knowledgable about the tank and gave us good information, and the hostess was super friendly which made the beginning of the experience very pleasant, but if you're a restaurant, the food has to be a huge focus as well, especially after you draw in crowds with the tank.",Aquarium Restaurant,6155143474,48 reviews,2015-10-13,"Memphis, TN",/biz/aquarium-restaurant-nashville,2.0,177,"Washington, DC",Steven M.

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I've always loved fish. Eat them, caring for them in fish tanks, fishing for them, love it all. I've never thought to eat at Aquarium until my sister told me she was coming down to visit us with her 3 year old son, Eli. I thought about Rainforest Cafe and this place. I've been to Rainforest before, however it's been probably 10-15 years but I remember I wasn't impressed with the overpriced food and that dusty animatronics. We decided on lunch at 1pm on a Sunday at Aquarium. You're able to make a reservation up to 2 hours before your selected reservation time. We made a reservation at 1pm. My sister arrived first and they said the whole part of 4 had to be present. I think that's a little silly, maybe a party of 8, but if you're going to sit someone at a 4 top, just sit them. I don't think we would've needed the reservation because they weren't very busy at all. Anyway, we arrived and Eli was so excited to go into the ""fish tunnel"".  The whole restaurant is a large circle, with the center being this huge, 220,000 gallon fish tank with all types of fish. Sharks, leopard sting rays, big fish, little fish, skinny fish, fat fish. You get the idea. They've got a sign near the tank that says ""please do not touch the glass"" which is very hard to get a 3 year old to follow. We looked at the fish for a little and then sat down to look at the menu. I'd actually had a late breakfast so I wasn't the most hungry. I also didn't want to spend 30 bucks on a fish dish at a themed restaurant. I ordered the mushroom burger for $13.99, and added fries for $1.99. Eli ordered the fish off the kids menu, my sister got the stuffed flounder or something and Phillip ordered the chicken wrap with their chips.Our server was friendly and competent. I read a lot of reviews on here that said the service was bad but I didn't have that experience. I'd say it took about 15 to 20 minutes for our food to arrive, which was okay because we let Eli look around at the fish. Our food arrived and the burger looked good. I'd ordered it a medium and it was. The fries were your normal restaurant fries. The burger had a good taste, the mushrooms tasted like they were from a can. It was good, not a great burger. I tried the chips and they tasted like they were fried in old oil. I tried the fish from Eli's kids meal and it was good. I actually liked it better than my burger. A moist fish with a crispy breading. I wished I was under ten so I could order the fish and chips meal for $5.99!!Overall this is a good place to take a kid for their entertainment. My nephew enjoyed the fish. I wouldn't come here to go on a date or with friends. They have a bar but it looks pretty small. On the way out I was trying to show Eli a sting ray and he was already over the fish and wanted to leave, so I don't think it's a place to bring kids all the time.",Aquarium Restaurant,6155143474,383 reviews,2015-03-23,"Nashville, TN",/biz/aquarium-restaurant-nashville,3.0,177,"Washington, DC",Billy H.

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I'm here now. I'll write as we go. 1. We are in Nashville on vacation with a toddler and a pre-schooler. A local suggested this place. Surprisingly positive yelp reviews convinced us to try it. 2. Pulling up, we realize it's in a mall. But it's next to the entrance to the Grand Ole Opty. So, theoretically, two birds one stone. (Park at the north end of the mall.)3. Walking in I'm having second thoughts. When the decor is the main attraction, how good can the food be? The kids are already thrilled with the fish. 4. Sure enough, everybody who says it's pricey is correct. $31.99 for a ribeye and mashed potatoes. $28ish for the fried sampler. $13 apps and $6.50 to add a side salad. But we are right next to a 30-foot long aquarium filled with tuna and sting rays and sharks. 5. The $13 red margarita in a souvenir glass is tasty. And enough for two if neither of you is a drunk. 6. On second thought, the drink is already done. Maybe it's just prices big enough for two. But it was good. We order another. 7. After a slightly too long wait when you've got little kids, Shrimp and Crab Dip arrives. It's the temperature of the sun. Good, if obvious. Tastes like a pizza topping full of crab. Good. Not amazeballs. A little spicy, for what it's worth. 8. The kids really like the stingray in the tank. 9. Food arrives quickly now. Mac n cheese for kids is room temperature, which is actually helpful. Their fried fish filet tastes fresh, crispy and moist. My plate looks like an amazing fried cornucopia. 10. The 2nd red margarita arrives and is quickly helping. 11. ""This is a cool dinner!"" The girl , age 4, spontaneously. 12. I think the tartar sauce has cinnamon in it. That's just weird. 13. The fried stuff is good! Not overdone, flavorful, crispy. I guess they know how to cook fish. It's a huge relief. Also... Margarita!14. I don't love the stuffed crab. It's like tuna ala king. 15. My side salad never arrived. But it's okay. The little cole slaw side that accompanies my plate of fried food is delightful!16. All the tables have at least one kid. (Except for one. Those poor women.) I don't think there's a great reason to come here without kids. But with them, provided you're not feeling strapped for cash, this place is a great choice. Gonna be one of the highlights of the vacation for my kids, I'm sure. 17. The dessert tray, presented vertically, is a chocolate nightmare. Each serving would feed a family of four in any country but this one. I pass, due to the sheer size. And I'm a pig. 18. The damage. Two souvenir red margaritas, a crab dip appetizer, two kids meals with milks, a captains platter and a fried shrimp platter: $109.17 plus tip. Worth it? Maybe. Maybe probably even. But only on vacation.19. 4 stars because it's exactly what you want for your kids, with better than expected food.

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I was impressed! Since it was a theme restaurant I was expecting expensive so-so food with a hyped experienced. What I found was an attentive friendly outgoing patient staff and a delicious experience. On a crazy busy weekend, the staff was on at 100%. One in my party had a gluten allergy and they gave her so much attention - from a hostess with a gluten allergy coming by to sit down and talk through the menu to give recommendations to the chef to hand deliver the dish on a separate tray to our man Segar giving our kids full attention when they were asking questions about the fish in the tank. Our meals were great and fresh, the presentation was impressive. I got the tower - great- my wife got the chicken pasta - great.

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Very pricey but like I told my granddaughter, some one has to pay for all these fish. This is the second time I was here and my granddaughter begged me to take her here. The coolest thing was it was feeding time with a diver at the bottom and all the fish were flocking to him. The stingrays were gobbling up the food and looked crazy. Now to the food for us...Ali had the salmon with asparagus, my wife had the cheesesteak sandwich, and I  had the Lobster Tower (cobb salad). Ali scrapped the sauce off the salmon and declared it ok, my wife's sandwich was delish, I ate a quarter of it. My salad was good, a black bean salsa came with it and greatly improved the flavor after I dumped it on the salad.

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I really had low expectations for the food here. Like most over-themed restaurants I expected the food to be mediocre at best and the prices to reflect the atmosphere.The service is very nice. They explain everything as you're going in. Our waiter was friendly and attentive but certainly not overbearing which could have easily distracted you from the attraction.We ordered the shrimp and crab dip appetizer. For some reason it comes out with pita triangles when you order it separate but with tortilla chips when it's with the sampler. We both thought it would have been better with the chips, maybe we could have asked for them. It was super hot and cheesy with a decent seafood flavor. Unfortunately it came out about 30 seconds before our entrees so we didn't have much of a chance to enjoy it.I ordered a Strawberry mojito. I'm not really a drinker but occasionally like to try drinks that will hopefully offer a lot of flavor. This one did, I enjoyed the flavors of strawberry, lime, mint, and soda. I meant to ask for just the drink as I really don't need another souvenir glass...but my forgetfulness means I now have a useless $3 glass that says Aquarium.I ordered the Seared Tuna Salad which had grapes, strawberries, mango, tortilla strips, and seared tuna atop leafy greens mixed with a small amount of vinaigrette. It's on their limited time menu so I don't know how long it will be around. Even for someone like me who doesn't use a lot of dressing I was kind of wishing there was more so be sure to ask for extra if you like a little salad with your dressing. The tuna had a great seasoning on the outside. It wasn't the best seared tuna I've ever had because it was a lot fatty and maybe cut a little too thick. Overall it was still a very good salad and I enjoyed the light summer flavors after a weekend of over-indulging on junk. My husband ordered the Bayou Shrimp pasta. This was a shot in the dark for him because he would normally have never considered a dish like this but he too was trying to stray from fried, heavy gut food. He really enjoyed the pasta.We both felt a little unimpressed that it's really only one aquarium in the center of the dining room. We thought the point was to be submerged and surrounded by water but the outer walls are simply murals of sea creatures. Kinda feels like they're cheating. Thought the restaurant still was very pretty and it was nice that there were no screaming kids because they were all entertained by the fish.I also liked that they seat you as close to the tank as they can get you on a first come first served basis. Not like some places that just try to even out the sections and even if they're are good tables available they'll seat you in the back. It was clear that here they fill the inner circle first and work their way outward.So the food was better than I expected but not necessarily worth the price tag. I think it would be worth coming with children because of the experience they'd have, but once you're an adult how many aquariums can be all that interesting?",Aquarium Restaurant,6155143474,333 reviews,2014-06-29,"Birmingham, AL",/biz/aquarium-restaurant-nashville,3.0,177,"Washington, DC",Ashley M.

It came with quartered tomatoes- old lettuce- a half of an avocado ontop - and ranch dressing... I think it probably was made wrong based on the description of the menu... But order something else if you go... Everything else that my family ordered looked good. We caved on getting our kiddos the ""shark lava cake dessert"" and of course it disappeared in 2 seconds!!!

And there was no one else there!  They also rudely instructed us that there is no strollers allowed behind the ""ropes"" and we MUST stroller park our stroller out in the mall.  We immediately were appalled by how rude they were!!!  If it weren't for the awesome fish tanks we would have left!!!

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Brought my niece here this evening and it was pretty decent. My niece had the cheese pizza and I stuck with getting an appetizer, the shrimp and crab dip. Beautiful place, pretty cool display of fish. However the food is quite pricey; thus my reasoning for getting an appetizer. The bill for the child's pizza, my appetizer(HUGE serving by the way) plus tip(required $3 ) was almost $30. So this will give you an idea of how much you'll spend. A little too pricey for my taste and I've been to places where shrimp baskets, fish tacos, and fish and chips were much cheaper and damn good. Oh, VERY LOUD KIDS! One little girl threw a big temper tantrum and two boys near by our table were screaming and yelling at the top of their lungs. The parents made it worse!!!! They were as loud as the kids and VERY country! Yea, this was unnerving and scared the hell out of my 6 year old niece. It was great all in all, good service, and deserved 4 stars.

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Let's start with we asked how long the wait was going to be for two people.  They said 60-70 min.  After about 10 min I got a text message that our table was ready.  We walked over and there was about 30 people who also got a text.  I went to the host stand and was told to stand in the crowed and it would be 5 more min.  Another 10 min went by and we were seated.  The host was difficult to hear as we were in the hallway of the mall and she didn't come out into the crowd to call names.  Upon being seated it took a little while for the waitress to come over.  It was obvious they over sat.  The drinks took a little while to come out.  Every time she visited the table she was short and rushed.  I swear she only heard half of what we said.  Boy was that true!We ordered an app and our meals.  First off, our app came out with the meal.  My fiancée's dinner was wrong.  $20 for fish n chips, okay a little over priced but they need to feed the fish.  What really bit me was the tarter sauce container.  It was the size of a quarter.  Once I finally was able to stop the waitress (this was the 3rd time to the table since getting food that she would let me talk) she brought out two identical size containers.  I still was not able to eat all of my fish with it but was so disappointed I wouldn't ask for more...Que the wrong meal.  The server (not even our waitress) took her meal back right away and put in her correct order.  Shortly after a guy with a plaid shirt comes over and says her meal will be right out, they were cooking it.  It was was really good upon arrival.  Not one person apologized or took responsibility for messing up the order.  The guy in the plaid shirt never introduced him self.Continue bad service...  The waitress seemed a little annoyed with getting me soda.  She asked if I still wanted refills on my soda.  I said no because I didn't want to pain her for doing her job.  About 5 min later I gave up eating.  I sat there twiddling my thumbs as I waited for my fiancée to finish her meal for another 15 min still no stop in from the waitress for dessert or anything.I finally flagged down someone with a walke talkie and asked for her to send the manager.  She wouldn't get him/her unless I stated what I wanted.  Moments after the waitress walked by so I asked for the check.  She quickly came back with it.  Moments after the same guy with the plaid shirt came over.  I explained how awful the service was and how annoying that it was I was paying $20 for fish and chips ($9.99 in NYC) and couldn't even get a sufficient amount of tarter sauce (well what they call tarter sauce).  He seamed bothered to have to talk to me, again didn't introduce himself.  He comped her meal and ran my card.Food tasted okay, presentation was good.  Service was poor but the atmosphere was awesome.",Aquarium Restaurant,6155143474,10 reviews,2014-08-30,"Ridgefield, CT",/biz/aquarium-restaurant-nashville,2.0,177,"Washington, DC",Chris M.

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"This place is both fun and romantic. My boyfriend and I are from New Jersey and came to Nashville for vacation and heard about this place from another couple we met at the hotel. So we decided to check it out. I made a reservation and got seated right away. Right next to us was a table of 15 young children celebrating a birthday party. Usually i don't mind this but this was our romantic dinner for the vacation and would have preferred it to be less loud. This is not the restaurants fault at all and I did make a last minute reservation so I took the blame for that and didn't say anything. The waitress was very nice and asked us what we wanted to drink. We  both wound up ordering Martinis and Loved them! We felt like we were underwater and got a seat right infront of the large aquarium that was in the middle of the place which was very nice.For an appetizer we ordered the bruschetta, it was excellent and the presentation was beautiful! We also ordered a salad to pick on and that was okay... was not as fresh as I would have liked it to be but we still ate it. For dinner we ate the Broiled Fisherman's Platter which was excellent! All the fish was fresh and it was a reasonable price! Definitely made up for the salad! What I didn't like however, was they brought it before we were even close to finishing our appetizers. We didn't complain then because I think it's just rude to send back food unless something is seriously wrong with it.  But did feel like we were being rushed.We then ordered dessert, by that time the birthday party left (thank goodness). They presented a lovely try of samples of what their desserts looked like which i love to see in resturants. It's pretty awsome seeing what your going to get before you get it hoping it looks like what you want it to look like. The surprise, the dessert we got was even bigger than the one they presented to us on the tray and was soooooooooooooo good! It's came with a giant thin fish cookie also that was both good and tasted good. We ordered the lava cake and it was one of the best lava cakes I ever had! At the end of dinner we walked around and took some pictures of the beautiful fish they had. So for now I give this place 3 stars, when I go back to Nashville I would like to try this place again because I believe it has the potential to reach 5 stars.",Aquarium Restaurant,6155143474,239 reviews,2013-11-18,"Palisades Park, NJ",/biz/aquarium-restaurant-nashville,3.0,177,"Washington, DC",Alyssa G.
"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"The place was very clean and well maintained. All the staff seemed knowledgeable about the fish in the main aquarium and were able to answer many questions about the fish, all the way down to which ones can and can not see outside of the glass. The food was delicious, although the server seemed to be having an off day. Forgot one entree and brought out the incorrect entree for another. However, he was apologetic and recognized his mistakes and took responsibility for them instead of trying to blame them on an unseen source (chef, perhaps) He was a little slow at refilling drinks, and the restaurant was not crowded at all. It was quite empty, actually. But, that is not surprising for a Thursday evening. Not terrible service, but definitely room for improvement.We went there for a birthday and she was slightly sad that they didn't do anything for birthdays (she chose Aquarium over Rainforest for her 13th) One would think a place like that would have a little something, even just a scoop of ice cream. Overall, everything was okay, but not overly impressive - besides the in depth knowledge about the fish from the staff.

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Note: this review is not based on food.The boyfriend and I walked past Aquarium several times on a recent trip to Nashville and we were lured in probably the same way many of the other patrons are--the pretty fishes, the alluring décor, the wonder of what happens when you take a left at the host stand. An under-water dining adventure? Count me in!Not hungry enough for food and not wanting to spoil our appetites for dinner, we chose to sit at the bar and enjoy a couple of drinks. We then met Chris, who is probably one of the coolest bartenders I've ever had--we talked everything from sports, the outcome of the NFL draft, to Game of Thrones and how to adjust his work schedule to accommodate watching Game of Thrones at the time it airs. A veteran employee at Aquarium, he recommended I try the mango mojito--and boy, does Chris make a mean mango mojito! On my next trip back, this will be the drink of choice.Although we chose not to eat here, we were able to enjoy being in the restaurant, which is, I have to admit, pretty neat! There were a bunch of families with their kids but the restaurant doesn't give off a kid's playground vibe. The gentleman at the bar next to us was a business traveler enjoying lunch. It's definitely an experience to be had, and I'd be delighted to go back and dine with all the gorgeous fish surrounding me.",Aquarium Restaurant,6155143474,424 reviews,2014-05-14,"Atlanta, GA",/biz/aquarium-restaurant-nashville,4.0,177,"Washington, DC",Ashley M.
"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I wouldn't normally go to a themed restaurant like this, but I couldn't pass this up, because I'm a SF writer who wrote a book about an underwater colony and I wanted to hopefully simulate the feeling of being in an underwater colony. Of course, it want anything like if expected, but it was till quite the experience. I really enjoyed the restaurant, despite my reservations (again I'm not really a seafood fan). The service was good and the wait for the food wasn't too long, despite how busy they were. I absolutely loved the gorgeous aquarium they had and the way they made it try and feel like you were underwater. They had a diver in with the sharks and other fish and it was adorable how she held a sign that said, ""welcome to the aquarium.""The fried shrimp was about average, not better than the cheaper places I've eaten at, but not less either. I went with a friend to catch up and I really liked how they seated us in a quieter part of the restaurant, so we could talk. The best part of the restaurant was their signature drinks however. A little pricey, but everything was here due to it's nature I suppose, but you get to keep the glass. They made a mistake on my friend's wine, but replaced it immediately with the right one and didn't charge her for the drink.

As for butter in the side dishes...mine didn't have enough ;).  And the bread was a couple of slices of day-old sandwich bread.

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Aquarium is definitely one of the more tourist focused restaurants (although that could be said for pretty much everything at Opry Mills) but the inside is pretty cool. All of the fish, eel, and even baby sharks were really interesting to look at and provide a lot of entertainment throughout your meal.I've been here a couple times since I've moved to the area and both times were pretty good, but nothing memorable. The first time I had the fried fish tacos, which actually had a pretty good flavor, but the sides that came with them were completely bland and pointless, in my opinion. The second time I had the Pico Tilapia (or something to that effect) which was pretty decent as well. The fish and the sides were all cooked in a whole lot of butter though, so that kind of overpowered everything on the plate.The prices here are outrageous for what you get, but I understand because I'm sure the cost to run that place is insane with all the tanks. Plus I'm sure they can upcharge the crap out of everything since it is geared more toward tourists. This is a pretty cool place to visit, and the food is decent. But be prepared to shell out quite a bit, especially if you want an appetizer or dessert.

Some kids might like the aquarium but my nearly 3 year old was frightened at times when the animls would get loud. And their food just isn't that great.My daughter loves fish however and I know this place has excellent food. The first time I checked it out the hostess was kind of rude so we decided to eat somewhere else. We went back the next day and rude hostess was gone and we decided to eat there. The food was great. And the atmosphere was very 3 and under friendly. Instead of my daughter crying from being scared of the loud animals at rainforest. I think she'd like rainforest when she gets older although because of the quality of the food I doubt we will be back to rainforest.

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Interesting concept: Dinner is watching the diners, and vice versa.  Not only is it in the mall, but it's in the Opryland Mall, so don't be surprised if it's expensive and touristy.  But it is fun, and it's fascinating watching the various sea creatures swimming around in the floor-to-ceiling aquarium while you're dining on seafood.  I got a kick out of watching all the little kids walking around, looking at all the fish.We started with the castaway combo, and the calamari and seafood dip were both very good.  I could have done without the mozzarella sticks, though.  My daughter enjoyed her shrimp po-boy and my wife enjoyed her broiled stuffed shrimp.  I had the broiled captain's platter and thought it was great.  I especially liked the stuffed crab.  For dessert, we shared a key lime pie, and it was so rich that we couldn't finish it.Our waitress was Kelley, who did an outstanding job.  She was obviously used to dealing with tourists, and she really seemed to enjoy being helpful.",Aquarium Restaurant,6155143474,282 reviews,2013-06-21,"Hendersonville, TN",/biz/aquarium-restaurant-nashville,4.0,177,"Washington, DC",Larry S.
"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Fun place to eat.  Kids had a blast looking at fish and adults did too.  Service was good and everyone was friendly.  Restaurant was clean.  Tanks were clean.  I really don't know why so many give bad ratings.  Maybe it's the food? Food is just ok.  Not fantastic but not bad either.  Shrimp crab dip for an app is really good. Calamari was just ok.  Kids all had normal kids food. Chicken fingers etc. Adults seemed fine with their meals.  Ahi salad was good and filling. Shrimp scampi was a bit skimpy and fish tacos were ok. Oh and the drinks were good too. We all had two rounds of drinks. : ). My recommendation would be to go for the atmosphere not the food.  It's so fun and the desserts are really cool too.  Lastly, it IS pricey but you are in a touristy area of Nash and you are paying for the atmosphere too.  Just know that going in.  Bill was $123 before tip for 3 adults and 2 kids.  We ate 2 appetizers , 3 adult entrees , 2 kids entrees and 1 dessert.  3 alcoholic beverages.",Aquarium Restaurant,6155143474,2 reviews,2014-11-28,"Franklin, TN",/biz/aquarium-restaurant-nashville,4.0,177,"Washington, DC",Kristen S.
"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I actually planned a trip to Nashville just to go to this restaurant, because it looked so cool! I was not disappointed. I knew what to expect, it is owned by Landry's - the same company that owns Rainforest Cafe, so you know it will be expensive, and not that great cuisine-wise, but a great visual experience. I was pleasantly surprised by our meal.We were seated right away since we had a reservation and I have a Landry's Select card for priority seating - which works at Disney as well if you want to go to Rainforest or T-Rex, plus you get rewards based on purchases at any of their restaurants. My little guy decided on the shrimp cocktail as his meal, since he won't eat it any other way, oldest and hubby both had fish and chips,and I had the Mahi and shrimp.The views of the aquariums were spectacular, we were disappointed that they no longer had the sting ray pond at this location, apparently the mall flooded and the pond was a casualty of the renovations. We had a wonderful time, met Sharkey the mascot, our food was quite possibly some of the best I have had at a ""Rainforest"" chain.

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"We went on last night, Tuesday night, and did not have to wait for a table. (630pm) The place was not very busy which was nice. The kids loved the set up. HUGE tank with lots of fish, some interacted with you too. Look up and it looks like you are sitting at the bottom of a reef. Too cool. Our waiter was fairly new, 2 weeks, I believe he said he had worked there. He asked the kids if they wanted to know about the tanks and fish and they said yes. He was very good about telling the kids which fish were what and anwering their questions. His name I believe was Zachary. I had the fresh tortilla wrap, my fiance has the Captains Broil, my son had the Top sirloin and shrimp, and my daughter had the philly cheese steak. All was very tasty. My only complaint about the food is the we wanted to order the onion rings but after 5 minutes was told they are out so we had to opt for something else. We chose the mozt sticks. Very tasty and the sauce for dipping reminded me of the kind you get at Ocharley with their mozt wedges. The manager came by and asked how things were and my son asked for A-1. He said sure, I can get that for you. Then we never saw him again. Finally, the waiter brought it to us. Another BOO at this place is we wanted the Arctic Indulgence (dessert) for my sons birthday but then again was told they are out of that so we had to choose something else. He chose the shark attack. This thing is HUGE! It is basically a big molten chocolate cake with lots of hot chocolate in the middle, scoop of ice cream on top, white choc drizzle, milk choc drizzle, crushed up heath bar, and a flat fortune cookie in the shape of a shark. All four of us could not eat the whole thing. There was about half of the cake left. Very good though. They even wrote Happy Birthday in chocolate on the side of the plate. TIP- if you order the shark attack please note it takes 15-20 minutes for them to cook/prepare it so order it before you are done eating your food!!The food is pricey but you get big portions. We will be back, but only for special occasions only because its about 45 minutes away from home. Definately something to bring the kiddies to!

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I went here for dinner while shopping around in the mall. I have a lot of allergies so a restaurant's ability to be patient and cooperative with me while running back and forth from the kitchen, making sure the food I'm ordering is ok for me to eat, is very important. Unfortunately in this case, the waitress I had was extremely rude and disrespectful when it came to my serious restrictions. Usually when I go to restaurants, the waiter or waitress will take down the list of allergies and ask the chef if my meal can be modified. In this case, the waitress immediately dismissed my allergies as too much of a hassle, making me feel like a burden to her and the restaurant. In the end she called over her manager and he took good care of me. He brought over an allergen sheet, and took notes on what I can and cannot (wheat, corn, rice, black pepper) have. He had the chef make me a new meal- that was allergen free and absolutely delicious. Overall my bad experience really only had to do with the waitress.

I had the captain's fried plate, a raspberry daquiri, and the bf had herb-crusted salmon. The food was really good, but very overpriced. I was able to try fried oysters and had some really good crab with my meal, but for the most part we felt that we could have gotten about the same thing for less at another restaurant.  We decided to have the ""shark attack"" dessert. It's a chocolate lava cake with ice cream and a shark-shaped sugar cookie on top. The portion was a bit large for two people. That was the only part of the meal that I didn't really enjoy. The cake had gotten soggy by absorbing the ""lava,"" so the texture was a little gross. Other than that, we really enjoyed our dinner.

We live in the Orlando area and my daughter had been wanting to go to an Aquarium restaurant so we stopped during a road trip. Going in, I actually said to my hubby to remember that the food is pretty bad so don't be disappointed. I was wrong! We started with the onion stack. It was perfectly breaded and fried and the jalapenos and pickles in there were a nice treat. My husband and I are vegetarians so we had the natural burger. It's one of the better veggie burgers I've had. The portions were huge. My son had a philly sandwich and he loved it. My daughter had the ahi tacos. The waitress warned they were small but she actually couldn't finish the 3rd one so it wasn't a problem. The service was super slow. It wasn't because our waitress was slow. She was working her butt off. So I didn't deduct anything for that. I'm not exactly sure what  the issue was because the kitchen was fast as heck. We just waited a while for refills, the check, boxes etc. The manager visited a couple times and they were really trying. I feel bad for the wait staff here because everyone is walking around and backing up and taking pics and the staff is trying to maneuver around the tourists. So when you go, be courteous about it. I saw a lady back into a server carrying a drink tray that crashed to the ground and the lady didn't even apologize to the server. One other tip: get the Landry's Select Club.

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Oooooverrated. I first took my mom here for her birthday on a trip to Nashville because I thought it'd be a little nicer than Rainforest Cafe. It was definitely nice, though it was disappointing.Even though it's more upscale, it doesn't stop parents from letting kids tap on the glass of the big aquarium circling the dining area and basically pressing their entire bodies against it. Not only can it be loud if you're near the aquarium area, but it's distracting and just rude. If you want to see fish, there's a petting area outside the restaurant where you can touch stingrays and such. This isn't a zoo.The food wasn't too terrible, but at these prices I expected better. Though the food wasn't inedible or anything. Just the whole time I kept thinking I could get probably the same thing at Rainforest Cafe for cheaper, or even Red Lobster.The service was kind of crappy. It wasn't slow, but he was the kind of waiter who immediately didn't fawn over us simply because we didn't order any alcohol. Sorry, not everyone needs a mixed drink or three to go with their food, and I don't think it's right to give someone less service because of it. Just because the bill will supposedly be smaller (even though one beer can be cheaper than a dessert, and you never know who's gonna order dessert) doesn't mean you should ignore a table because it means you'll get a smaller tip.

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"The only cool thing about this place is the actual aquarium within the restaurant.  Our server, Christopher, had a pretty good knowledge about the many variety of fish and that's the only positive feedback I can give.  We were seated by our server and he was somewhat pleasant, but also more bland than anything and not much character.  We're still in the car saying how shitty our experience was there!  I decided to order the herb-encrusted salmon entree which was quite delicious!  My boyfriend ordered the Cajun mahi mahi dish and that was absolutely awful!! He likes spicy, I hate spicy.. I tried it and there was NO FLAVOR, NO SPICE whatsoever.  On top of that, it tasted frozen and not fresh at all.  So, he returned it and ordered what I had- the herb-encrusted salmon.  After about 30-40 MINUTES LATER, the salmon came out and it tasted super over cooked and mash potatoes had no flavor.  It definitely didn't taste like what I had ordered!  The manager came over once saying the salmon will be right out.  They all clearly forgot about it.  He didn't eat that, either.  The server, nor the manager, did not offer anything to compensate for our awful experience!  The manager did not even make an effort to converse with us!  I had to ask that our bill only had my entree and beverage on it!  Just ridiculous.  THE SHITTY CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT!!

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,So this place is inside the mall.  My expectations were1)  It would be expensive for the type of food served2)  The food would be mehSo I was correct about one of my expectations.  It's a little high but you have to expect that from a restaurant inside a tourist outlet mall.  What I was wrong about was the quality of the meal.  Surprisingly very good.  We started off with the crab and shrimp dip.  Highly recommend.  My entree was the sautéed gulf Snapper.  They rocked it.If you have kids then they are going to love this place.,Aquarium Restaurant,6155143474,271 reviews,2012-11-28,"Winston-Salem, NC",/biz/aquarium-restaurant-nashville,4.0,177,"Washington, DC",Tim S.
"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I wish I could rate it a zero. This was the worst service experience we have ever had. Our server took our order and then we saw her 1 time after that. We had to order a glass of water 3 times. Our empty dishes from our appetizer and drinks stayed on our table the entire time because she never bothered to clear them or check on us. As seafood lovers, when the food came we were excited, only to be disappointed. Our scallops and lobster were overcooked almost to the point of making them inedible. The mahi mahi was tasteless and definitely needed to be seasoned. The shrimp was okay, but not stellar, and the stuffed crab was so spicy I couldn't even eat it. The best part of our dinner was the RICE. For $35 a piece, this was extremely ridiculous and disappointing.

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I really liked our visit to Aquarium, as an alternative to Ranforest Cafe. Really, it was super cool :) We did have a 45 minute wait, but they can send you off with a pager or text you when your table is ready, so you can peruse the mall or something. Appreciated that opportuinity, as opposed to standing around the gift shop the whole time.All servers and hosts are trained to be very knowledgable about the marine life they harbor, and it is truly a treat. At the main entrance they have smaller aquariums with tropical fish / young large fish, but inside they move the growing specimens and also have rays, eels, sharks, parrotfish, and the most amazing grouper ever. Staff is happy to tell you all about their aquariums, and you're free to get up and look around while waiting for your food.Now, the food was pretty good, and being on a trip we didn't really spare expenses and got what we wanted, which was the tilapia and the mahi mahi. We also got the castaway combo platter, which wasn't worth it really, but the seafood dip in the middle was very good. We both really loved our meals and were stuffed for HOURS to come. I went to bed feeling overstuffed 4 hours after we left, and I hadn't finished my plate... so this is definitely a place you could take leftovers from.We also had a pait of cocktails. They're a bit steep at 11.99, but they're 21 ounces and you get to keep a souvenir glass for each one, so it's actually pretty reasonable. I had the mango mojito and he had the mai tai... both were wonderful, but the mango mojito did not disappoint :)With 2 cocktails, a beer, the mahi mahi, tilapia, and castaway combo plus tax, our bill rang in at $99, so it is a bit pricey for a dinner out for two.... but I really thouight it was a fun, unique experience.Our server (Ashley!) was a doll!",Aquarium Restaurant,6155143474,155 reviews,2013-03-27,"Philadelphia, PA",/biz/aquarium-restaurant-nashville,4.0,177,"Washington, DC",Autumn E.

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Short version - The dinner from Hell.  Four of us arrived, with reservations, on a Thursday evening for dinner.  We had been here six years ago and enjoyed the experience, good food, good service, interesting ambiance with the fish tanks.  We are coming back through the area with another couple this year, we say, ""have to go to the Aquarium, great place."" We got seated immediately, but it took ten minutes for a waiter to get our drink order and another 15 for it to arrive.  The appetizer platter took over 30 minutes and the waiter tried to serve us our soup before the appetizer even arrived.  The main course arrived cold and when reheated at least one of the lobster tails turned to mush.  My steak was cooked just how I like it, very rare, but it was so tough you almost needed a chain saw to cut it.  The grilled shrimp was excellent, my lobster pretty good.  One of our party ordered the Mahi Mahi and shrimp and it was so spicy she couldn't eat it, so she sent it back.The place was so cold we had to change tables to try and get out from under the cold air blowing from the registers.  The service was some of the worst I have ever seen.  We complained to the manager twice, the waiter didn't even take the meal we sent back off the bill, we had to call the manager over again to get that taken care of.  The place was filled with impolite, screaming kids, running all over the place, yelling and hollering and half the adults were hopping in and out of the chairs and booths as much as the kids.  You can see the damn fish from the table, you don't have to put your nose on the tank glass.  I realize that the restaurant can't control that part of the dining experience, but I bring it up because if you are looking for a fine dining experience the only part of it you will get here will be the price.  The four of us ended up paying $250 for one of the worst overall dining experiences I have ever had.  Never again, and probably not just Aquarium, but probably any Landry property.  We had a similar experience with service and poor food quality at Landry's in San Antonio a month ago.Ugly ugly ugly.",Aquarium Restaurant,6155143474,71 reviews,2012-08-02,"Pahrump, NV",/biz/aquarium-restaurant-nashville,1.0,177,"Washington, DC",Roy H.

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I was in Tennessee for vacation and made a reservation for 4. When we arrived at the restaurant they said they received no such reservation but were able to seat us immediately anyways. We got seated at a booth far away from seeing the fish up close which was a disappointment especially since they clearly had better seating available. The restaurant is basically a marine version of the Rainforest Cafe (which ironically was located in the same mall). The only thing worth going back to this restaurant for was to watch the fish. The service was absolutely terrible and the food was similar to that of the Rainforest Cafe - mediocre. Nothing special about the food, just your basic mozzarella sticks, burgers, fish platters, etc. Of course, for a vegetarian like myself it was hard to find things on the menu without having to ask our waitress for alterations. Focusing now on the service our waitress was in a sour mood the entire time and came off as even a tad rude. She didn't come back often either so we were stuck waiting to ask her questions for long periods of time. She wasn't patient at all when we said we needed more time to decide either and was annoyed with us. It was my first time trying sweet tea and I hated it. Their sweet tea was WAY too sweet so I sent it back. She still charged me for it though. Towards the end of the meal I asked for a refill of water which never came too. Overall, I wasn't impressed with the restaurant.

He was overly friendly, but had the car salesman attitude about him and made me feel uncomfortable. Our food took a LONG time to come out, despite being very quiet when we visited.

I was really hesitant to order the mahi mahi tacos but I was pretty clear that I hoped they were good! They actually were pretty good! I was impressed for sure, but the sides were only so-so. In the end, we WAY overpaid for the food, but I figure the higher price of the food supports the upkeep of the aquarium, so I'm okay with that. Our kids loved the aquarium and my older son really enjoyed ""painting"" his own shark rice crispy treat. We'll have to carry that idea over for dessert nights at home!We would go back, but I really hope I don't get a pushy server like this guy was again.

Every plate came out correct :)   I do not eat seafood and this seemed like a sea-foody kinda place-- best food I ate on the trip was at The Aquarium.  In the middle of the restaurant is a huge fish tank that the kids can go look at, they even have a diver in there holding up a sign and stopping in the tank so parents can take pictures with her and their children.  The waiter knew so much about the fish in the tank.

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"This was a toughie for me. I teetered on 4 or 5 stars. Why? Because I have been here 3 times now and the 3rd time just wasn't the same as years past. 2 experiences were before the Nashville flood and 1 experience was just last week soon after Opry Mills had reopened. Before the flood: I would have given this place 6 stars if it was possible. Everything was perfect. My steak was so tender you could literally cut it with a spoon. The onion straws atop the steak were quite delightful and made the meal standout aesthetically. The potatoes were perfectly seasoned and moist. Everything from start to finish was incredible in the past. The atmosphere, the service, the cleanliness of my surroundings......and don't forget, the giant aquarium you are surrounded by while eating. After the flood: The food was still excellent but not as good as I had remembered. The steak was cooked just how I had asked but didn't look that fabulous on my plate (no presentation). I had the green beans and taters as my sides. The green beans were good but I had more onion in the mix than actual green beans. The taters were still the whip but again, there was absolutely no presentation. The plate looked sad. The server was HORRIBLE. He was over-friendly in a cheesy kind of way. He started talking about a subject mid-sentence so you had no idea what he was talking about. He did not inform us on any species of the fish as I had experienced in the past. I wanted this experience because I was with someone that had never been there before. When we arrived, we had 3 different servers piece together our drink order, find us some silverware, and re-clean our table as it was quite nasty when we sat down. This place has declined which is a shame because I LOVED this restaurant so much in the past. I am still giving them 4 stars because the flavor of my steak was excellent, it was cooked perfectly, and all remaining food items were mighty tasty. The Aquarium itself is still really cool. And I have taken into account that Opry Mills JUST reopened like a week prior so maybe they hadn't got all their ducks in a row just yet. As for the server we had, he should find a new career. I literally thought it was his first day because he seemed ditzty, nervous, and uneducated about the establishment. But as the evening continued, he explained that he worked there before the flood too. Damn, I cannot believe he is a waiter. Shocking! Overall, I still suggest this place for a nice night out. It is even great for kids as they get a kick out of watching the fish/sharks/stingrays swim. I do find it quite mean that they have fish on the menu though. LOL. I always order the steak!!!! ;-)",Aquarium Restaurant,6155143474,109 reviews,2012-05-16,"Ann Arbor, MI",/biz/aquarium-restaurant-nashville,4.0,177,"Washington, DC",Jenee M.

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Not the worst themed restaurant in existence, but certainly no where near the best. I came here with my mom and my sister for the sister's birthday lunch. Sister picked this place over Macaroni Grill and Tony Roma's, also both in the Opry Mills Mall. We were seated right away on a weekday at around 1 p.m. at a table with a great view of the aquarium.And the aquarium is nice. It is by far the best thing about the joint. When we arrived there was a diver feeding the fish, so that was neat. But everything went downhill from there. The menu is way to expensive for the items listed, which are very typical seafood items. Think Red Lobster, but even more pricey.The wine list was pretty pitiful, but I did find a decent sauvignon blanc for just over 7 dollars. The server, Randall, recommended the crab dip, and it was pretty good, once it arrived. The food all came out super-slow. I got a side salad, mom got the fish tacos and Amy got chicken lettuce wraps. Like I said, they took forever to arrive. Randall was competent (and I think I may have gone to high school with him), but the kitchen was obviously having problems getting entrees out, even with the place nearly empty.It is a decent place to take kids, I'd imagine, but the menu is expensive. Take the rugrats in to see the aquarium for free--you can do that--despite it being a distraction to paying diners.Simply put this is a tourist trap with average food.

Some of the best buttery cheesy pasta I've ever eaten. The veggies weren't soggy and overcooked they were just right! The fish swimming around in the Aquarium wall next to me were probably glad that i wasn't eating their brother. Prices are within the 10-12 dollar range for fish and chicken, beef was more. People at my booth were saying that their fish was the best they'd ever eaten. Wow!! The service was quick, pleasant and knowledgeable.This is a great place for kids small or large--like me.

We spent the next two hours ordering and waiting to receive - one pepsi, one daiquiri and one order of bread pudding. We didn't even meet our waiter until we'd been sitting there for 15 minutes.

"516 Opry Mills DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"Let's just be honest about this, Aquarium Restaurant is not about the food.  I  That being said the Aquarium Restaurant takes the experience part of ""dining experience"" very seriously.  They have a huge aquarium in the center of the restaurant that houses many different kinds of fish.  After an ungodly long wait to be seated (this place draws tourists like whoa) we managed to talk the host into getting us one of the tables closest to the aquarium.  A little flat red fish that I named Philip sat and stared at us the whole time.  Fish like Philip and the rest made me feel a little guilty about eating their kind so I made sure to order a plate that was mostly crab and shrimp.  The food was actually far from terrible, but it's obvious that the experience is built into the price more than any sort of gourmet focus.The gift shop is great if you have kids or dorks like me who are easily charmed.  Don't be put off by the strong fish smell when you approach the restaurant like I was.  Usually that's a deal-breaker sign when coming to a seafood restaurant, but the smell actually comes from the Stingray Reef interactive exhibit across from Aquarium Restaurant.",Aquarium Restaurant,6155143474,241 reviews,2008-10-05,"Austin, TX",/biz/aquarium-restaurant-nashville,4.0,177,"Washington, DC",Kyla A.

The waiter explained to us that that Guitar Fish was the offspring of a manta ray and a nurse shark. So if you can imagine, it had a head like a ray but a tail like a nurse shark.

"154 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"After attending a show I wanted to grab a bite to eat downtown, but still avoid the more popular places that were busy. The person working outside of Coyote Ugly/Buffalo Billiards told my fiance and I that this place had a much better atmosphere and more food options than the bar, so we opted to give it a try. I wish we had just left the downtown area altogether and found a real restaurant.The service was terrible! There were about 15 people sitting around the bar drinking and watching football and a handful of people in booths lining the wall so we grabbed a table on the backside of the bar. There were several guys working the bar and one came back to get a drink order. A few minutes later he brought menus, then drinks, and not long after he took our order - which was all fine. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. He finally brought out the only thing we ordered - the calamari appetizer which the person outside had recommended. It was horrible. I'm not sure if it was undercooked or overcooked but it was rubbery - I chewed and chewed and nothing happened. I had to spit it out. I thought maybe it was a fluke piece and tried again, nope, just as rubbery.On top of that I didn't like the drink I ordered and wanted something else the next time our server/bartender came to our table, but he never did. My fiance finished his drink and wanted to order another as well. We even tried multiple times as he passed by our table to get his attention no avail. I ended up passing him my drink and giving up on the entire idea of ordering anything else at all. There may have been other bartenders/servers pass by, but since everyone dressed in regular jeans, tees, and baseball caps we have no idea who actually worked there.When he finally did come around to our table it was with the check. I told him that the calamari was cooked wrong and I wasn't able to eat it - proof being that the entire plate was full of it- and he offered to take it off the ticket, good, because the last thing I wanted to do was pay for it.This may be a great bar to hang out in, but if you're looking for food I strongly recommend you look elsewhere.

I walked up to the bar where there was only one bartender but he was professional and broke away from a conversation with two ladies to pour me my beer.

"154 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"Just the mention of the name Buffalo Billiards takes me back to the early-mid 90s when every summer weekend night ended up with a foray down 2nd Ave.  It typically ended up at Buffalo Billiards or the upstairs Havana Lounge where the cigars smoked and the swing band played.  Ah college!After moving away for 11 years and getting a little above the age of the usual suspects down on 2nd Ave I could barely believe it when I heard that they were still open.  A friend decided to get togther at BB this weekend and I was pleased to ""party like its '95"" again!  Thisplace has changed considerably from the old days but not in a bad way.  Downstairs is now a Dick's Last Resort so gone is the huge room full of pool tables and cute boys.  Upstairs where the Havana Lounge was is now the entirety of Buffalo Billiards.  Don't worry though, it is still a pretty sizeable bar!  The huge round bar still exists and these great big Samsung HDTVs are all around the bar.  (Bonus - they had the one in front of me on the NASCAR race!!)  Tables are also available on the left side of the bar.  In the back is another bar and two rooms with pool tables.  Note that you can reserve one or both of these two rooms for private parties (as I have for my December birthday)!  They had good 90s rock playing (Soundgarden! Pearl Jam!  Alice in Chains!) which will take you back ,again, in a good way.  The vibe is chill and you can actually hear each other talk.  Drinks were strong - they were not playing around with these.  And all the bartender/bartendress staff I saw were good lookin, so you can have some eye candy with your drink.  Also noticed a dart board in the back too so you can challenge your friends to a duo of bar games (maybe a trio if you play quarters or something?  No?  But it's 1995 man!)So yeah, I loved the vibe and the whole feel of this place and am glad I have it reserved for my birthday in a few months.  Give it a try if you are downtown and want to get away from crazy tourist traps and Irish-pub-dance-club places!",Buffalo’s Nashville,6153137665,1027 reviews,2011-07-25,"Nashville, TN",/biz/buffalos-nashville-nashville,4.0,23,"Washington, DC",Nickie G.

"154 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"Buffalo Billiards offers a perfect low key respite from the throngs on Broadway- a place to shoot pool, play darts or shuffleboard or just enjoy a beer on the comfy couches. Tucked upstairs from 2 other raucous bars, be sure not to enter the wrong place- you maybe sorely disappointed. Even on a weekend night, Buffalo Billiards doesn't get too crowded until late night, so you have time and space to really spread out if you're with a large group. Where else can you say that in downtown Nashville? Even more surprising was the fact that the food is not your typical bar schlock-  yes, there is a plethora of fried indulgences, but the offerings are tasty.

"154 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"This is the main reason I find myself back on 2nd Ave from time to time. Such a difference between the relaxed casual environment inside and the trashy Coyote Ugly crowd that you can see from out the window of Buffalo Billiards. Bar: Fairly good sized. Well tended. Decent drink specials. Not too crowded. Darts: Any good pool hall will have a darts area. This is no different. Standard, but fun. Pool: There are quite a lot of pool tables. As someone who used to bartend at a billiard parlor and played on a great many tables, I can say that these leave a little to be desired. The cloth plays REALLY slow and should be replaced. The rails are adequate. However, there are not a lot of good tables in Nashville, so this is where I find myself playing the most. For the casual player, this is everything you need. Be aware, the prices change depending on when you are there. Pool is free before 7 and all day Sunday. Friday and Saturday nights see a hefty increase in prices. You are paying per hour based on the number of people that are playing on that table. Plan accordingly and check out the website for more pricing info.Bathrooms: Cleaner than expected. Sports section of the day's newspaper hung on the walls. Odd, but a nice touch. Misc: Large TV's playing sports offer a good place to watch the game while you hang out with a crowd that might not be that interested in it. There are also some comfortable seating areas with couches and chairs.

"154 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",4.0,"So Buffalo Billiards was my first foray into Nashville. I flew in from NYC for the weekend and headed straight to Buffalo Billiards where Vanderbilt Law was having its Bar Review. $7 for two beers and a HUGE Long Island iced tea? Are you kidding me? Are all southern bars like this?? A friend got the beers and I got the LI tea...times two. Now, I can hold my liquor with the best of them, but these teas did me in. And all I spent was $7 plus tip (having split the cost with my friend). Since I'll be going from making a good living in NYC to about $120k in the hole for the next three years, cheap drinking is a necessity.

"209 10th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I love a good, cheap Mexican eatery. I'm the furthest thing from a food snob (mini rant: how can you be pretentious about a necessity that so many people don't have?), so when the craving hits me, I just require cheap, yummy food, free (unlimited) chips and salsa, and friendly service. I got all of this here at Cinco de Mayo, located in downtown Nashville.Cinco was about a .5 mile mark from my hotel. I had already had my barbecue fix for the day, so what I really wanted was an icy margarita (rare, for me, as I'm not much of a drinker) and cheesy, crunchy, grilled, spicy eats. The restaurant is kind of oddly located inside a nice, sort of flex space building. We almost missed it, because all the signs are tiny and in black-and-white (don't be deterred by the boring signage, we found out that this is just a local ordinance requirement). They do not have patio seating available yet, but the host said that they are working on it and expect there to be patio seating available next week.We were seated very quickly, and I will say that we had the friendliest, most smiley server. One Modelo and one frozen margarita later (the margarita was lime green, refreshingly tangy and quite stout), we had noshed to our hearts' content on the warm chips and salsa (nothing special but quite tasty). My dinner partner ordered the chicken fajitas: they came with rice, refried beans, guacamole, sour cream and some type of side salad. I ordered the number 30 on the menu, 'camarones con piña', but swapped out the shrimps for grilled chicken. I also ordered a side of guacamole, and they bright out a generous bowl of it. It was a little bland and overly mashed for me, I would have liked some more chunky texture and garlicky, lime-y zing, but it was still adequate.I found my dish to be hearty and delicious - just what I was a craving. A big portion of Mexican rice topped with chunks of tender grilled chicken, grilled pineapple, and sautéed onions and bell peppers, and smothered in white cheese sauce. It was standard, familiar Mexican fare, and I dare say some foodies would turn up their noses at such an inauthentic dish - but I just loved it and gobbled it up with gusto. The portions were so generous that we were both too full to finish our meals.The tab before tip (two entrees, 1 Modelo, 1 regular margarita, and an order of guacamole) came to about $38 - more than reasonable for such satisfying, hearty portions. Cinco is a little away from the strip of bars and the live music; but I needed a little break from the inflated prices and nonstop, raucous noise. I will definitely visit here again the next time I am downtown and I hope their outdoor seating is available by then!",Cinco de Mayo,6158734296,181 reviews,2014-04-09,"Cincinnati, OH",/biz/cinco-de-mayo-nashville-2,4.0,31,"Washington, DC",Anna S.

You'll find hard shell tacos, fajitas, sour cream and all that stuff Americans associate with Mexican cuisine but isn't actually eaten in Mexico. However, it's pretty damn good. I've yet to try a dish that I didn't find tasty. The Mexican style chicken soup they serve is the best chicken soup I've had in my life, it's very hearty and will keep you full for hours and it is just so flavorful. I know most people don't go to Mexican restaurants for a bowl of chicken soup, but don't sleep on this soup, it's awesome! I think the salsa is satisfying for a standard restaurant. Only mildly spicy. I wish they had a few different salsa options with more bite.Prices are great. The lunch specials are so cheap that I wonder if this restaurant can even make money.

"209 10th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"So I frequented this place weekly due to the convenience of it being in the same building as my office. And it was pretty standard fare, cheap Mexican with some pretty killer lunchtime deals. Solid 3 stars from me. Decent service, decent food, better than decent price. No complaints here...until this fateful evening about a week ago. Now I've been too ashamed/traumatized to share my story, until now. (Cue law and order music) I like to think I'm an easy customer, I never complicate my order, I always know what I want when the server comes to the table and if I don't- I wing it. I've never sent food back, even if it nowhere near even resembles what I ordered, and I always tip a minimum of 20% regardless of service. That's just how I roll, I understand that other people roll in different directions. Take my coworker for example, she needs to customize, I doubt there's ever been a time where she ordered right off of the menu, the food is always sent back, and the tip, well... we'll just say it's below my standard but to each his own right? Who am I to tell someone how to live their life? Well, you see, here's a problem with eating out with people you don't know too well, who just so happen to frequent the same little eateries you do -you become guilty by association. My co-worker and I walk in the doors of Cinco De Mayo at around 9pm and the host tells us to sit wherever we'd like and hands us some menus. I scan it quickly, already knowing what I want, the usual quesadilla and queso and chips. (I swear if you cut my veins open cheese would probably just pour out at this point) and wait for my associate to figure out what she wants. We silently close our menus and discuss a future project. 10 minutes in, my stomach reminds me that I haven't eaten yet. It also says ""hey girl, I'm thirsty, quit playing around and pay attention, I have needs too"" whatever stomach, quit your grumbling. It yells at me again 10 minutes later, pretty sure at this point that my ex and my tummy having been sharing notes. I'm also pretty sure that it's entirely too long to be waiting for food here, not to mention a drink or even a hello from the server. My co worker picks up on my desperate scan around the restaurant and decides to go straight to the host and ask what the deal is. After some shouting back and forth between the host and the server, I catch wind of what's going on, and let me tell you it stinks. The server comes over to greet us and casually explains that they're closed. My coworker replies ""but you close at 10, we have menus!"" Server simply responds ""tonight we close at 9:25"" before turning to walk away. I know he sees the desperation in my eyes. I silently plead with him for just one chip dipped in salsa. Alas, my silent cries fall on deaf ears. My coworker heads to the bathroom before we leave, and an unsweetened iced tea is sat on the table. A quiet and quick peace offering. I slurp it down and wait for my associate outside, vowing to never eat with her anywhere I respect ever again. Basically this place gets 3 stars from me on a good day, knocking a star off for leaving me go hungry and the sketchy service but I'll adjust after my likely return, solo.",Cinco de Mayo,6158734296,6 reviews,2014-10-03,"Nashville, TN",/biz/cinco-de-mayo-nashville-2,2.0,31,"Washington, DC",Meghan B.

I'm thinking about moving to Nashville and considering my love of Mexican food, I needed to find a restaurant that was at least decent. This one was even better than that! Their tamales were to die for. They even rivaled the ones from my favorite Mexican place, which is saying something. The sauce on the tamale was so good and the outside was perfect. The steak fajitas were also really great, as well as the salsa. The only reason it's not 5 stars is the queso.

The burrito had ground beef inside, maybe some sort of queso dip? Sprinkled with cheese. The enchilada had the queso dip and sprinkled with cheese. Super bland, unexciting.

Now if the same dish was prepared maybe in some red wine, some organic hen instead of chicken and served in expensive cutlery, it becomes fine dining and yet it gets sold in mid towns of usa.Basically, I want to tell a lot of fine dining chefs who think they are creating innovative stuff to shut up.

Nothing amazing, but if you aren't too far away its worth a pit stop. The lunch special ($6 including the tax and a drink) is hard to beat, and the overall value is very solid. Waitstaff were all friendly and attentive. Really wanted to give this place 4 stars, but it's just not somewhere that's worth going out of the way for, so 3 stars it is.

"3754 Nolensville PikeNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"My cousin introduced me to Couser's Southern Restaurant this afternoon. The first thing I noticed as we approached the building (which was nice enough) was the lack of signage. Had I not been with someone who knew the place was there, I would never have noticed the unassuming white sided Southern house looking establishment. As we parked right in front of the door, and walked up the sidewalk to enter, it began to feel more like a restaurant. Inside, the decor was sparse, but considerably better than overdone, as so many family owned businesses tend to be. I did notice two lovely large portraits on the left going inside, an older gentleman, and a pleasant, sweet looking older woman, in beautiful frames. I had to get a closer look, and was intrigued with them. I am not a local, only visiting the city, so I had no clue as to who the people were, or why their portraits would be hanging inside the restaurant. As I glanced around the dining room, I noticed a nice looking more mature couple dining at a corner table, then we were led to our table by one of the nicest waitresses I have ever encountered. We made our selection from the ample menu, and decided to take a picture of the two of us for a keepsake of my visit to Nashville. There were several Nashville themed posters around, all nice, and we stood to include one next to our table in the picture between us. Another sweet waitress ran over and offered to snap our picture for us. We were most grateful, since selfies are difficult most times, especially when you want to have a large poster in the picture with two faces. We thanked her and as we sat back down, our food was arriving. We were rather surprised since we had not been there very long. We were both very happy with the appearance of our food, and began to eat. I ordered a side of Mac & Cheese, which looked amazing. One bite and I knew all other Mac & Cheese I had ever eaten in my 58 years was slightly superior to gruel. This was a taste bud sensation I had never experienced. Fantastic! I ordered another side of the amazing cheese-laden delight. Pure bliss. Put my own mother's Mac & Cheese to shame, and that woman could do no wrong. My cousin got Salmon Croquettes, which she claimed to be the best she had ever eaten. I had the chicken tenders, also, which were perfectly prepared, and probably up to par with any restaurants tenders. Of course we had other items, all of which were very good, but the Mac & Cheese and Salmon Croquettes were beyond all expectation for any Southern style restaurant.Afterward, we went to pay (incredibly pleased with the charge), and I inquired about the portraits, and was told that was Mr. & Mrs. Couser, then I asked if the older couple dining were that couple, and my suspicion was confirmed. One thing I know is Couser's will be on my list of places to visit every time I come to Nashville. Thank you, Mr. & Mrs. Couser for a wonderful dining experience. I will see you again.

The Roast Beef was served as generous slices of tender meat covered in gravy. The gravy and the meat lacked flavor. I am not into salt these days, but I had to reach for the shaker to give this gray beef and almost colorless gravy some flavor. The same can be said for the Pintos. The Okra was ordered ""crispy"" and arrived soggy. Ok. The cole slaw was really good, sweet and tangy. One dining buddy had the Hamburger Steak which could have used some gravy to keep it from being so dry. No gravy was ordered and requested by him because he could tell that my gravy was not up to par. He seemed to down the Mac and Cheese and Green Beans without a word. My dining princess had the kids hamburger and Mashed Potatoes with Gravy. She took care of both seemingly enjoying the taste. The Fudge Pie, well, I am not sure.

Sitting at the corner in a strip mall near green hills, your next dining experience awaits. You order at a counter and can either do carry out or dine in. Very clean inside, good for lunch or a casual dinner. Imagine a Mediterranean panera. I came here for lunch on a Saturday and ordered the chicken gyro. The meal comes with potato chips and a choice of a side, I had the basmati rice. This pita sandwich came with homemade tzatzicki sauce, which was good but also a little heavy on the dill. Also not enough of it in my opinion, but I'm one of those people that must have it covering every bite or I'm not satisfied.

"2190 Bandywood DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"The service has always been a little spotty and I usually get take-out here. Slow and confused is the best way to describe itRarely crowded. There is a musty smell here today - to be fair, it is raining, but still. Have been eating egg and olive salad since I was a kid so was excited (and a bit puzzled) to see it here. It's okay, but has too much bacon. Words I rarely say, but it throws off the balance of the flavors. The special I got, a spanakopita wrap - spinach, feta, grilled chicken in a flour tortilla was mediocre at best - stringy spinach, dry tenders and feta with no seasonings or spice to elevate the flavor. There was a side of salsa for dipping, but that wasn't the flavor I envisioned when I ordered Spanakopita. Mediterranean food is usually simple, which means you have to start with quality, fresh ingredients and add at least some seasoning perhaps garlic and oregano, to bring it to life. I haven't noticed Taziki's doing either. My suggestion for people coming here is come on Wednesday for half price wine and stick to appetizers that are hard to mess up, like hummus. There are better",Taziki’s Mediterranean Cafe,6158731027,78 reviews,2014-05-14,"Nashville, TN",/biz/tazikis-mediterranean-cafe-nashville-2,2.0,32,"Washington, DC",Diana S.
"2190 Bandywood DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,Fresh Greek/Mediterranean food.The food is always fresh.  Their salads are huge.  I usually get their chicken rolls with cucumber-tomato salad.  I've had their lamb/beef gyro and it's pretty good.  If it's busy you may wait a while for your food.  Beware of the random little girl that is sometimes outside the front door selling Paletas (Mexican ice cream)... unless you like Paletas.Location - Good.Parking - Fair.Service - Fair/Good.Food - Good.Pricing - Fair/Good.,Taziki’s Mediterranean Cafe,6158731027,29 reviews,2014-07-25,"Nashville, TN",/biz/tazikis-mediterranean-cafe-nashville-2,3.0,32,"Washington, DC",Mary V.
"2190 Bandywood DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I really like Taziki's!  They gave a nice face-lift to an old, dark sushi  restaurant that occupied that spot.  The food is very good and I usually stop by at least once every two weeks.This is obviously a Mediterranean style restaurant, but the food is much better than most places serving this style of cuisine.  Their normal dishes are very good--gyros, salads, and humus.  Their baklava is excellent!However, my recommendation would be to go with the special of the day.  It's always very good and I love their pasta salad.  It rotates each day, but is consistent week by week if you find a special that you like.This spot also gives you a reasonable chance of seeing a celebrity.  Kirk Herbstreit, Matt Hasselbeck, and Kenny Chesney are all on my celebrity sightings list for Taziki's.  The best part about seeing a celebrity in Nashville is that we leave them alone and let them eat in peace.  I think that's pretty cool.I've always gone with a take-out order here, but they do serve wine and beer.  The food is quite good and the wait is usually reasonable, even during normal lunch hours.  This is an excellent restaurant for Mediterranean food and I'll continue to frequent Taziki's.",Taziki’s Mediterranean Cafe,6158731027,171 reviews,2013-11-27,"Franklin, TN",/biz/tazikis-mediterranean-cafe-nashville-2,4.0,32,"Washington, DC",Adam V.
"2190 Bandywood DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I came to Taziki's because a friend recommended to me that it was one of the best ""Mediterranean"" restaurants in town.After eating here I felt obligated to lecture him for hours on what ""Mediterranean"" food truly is. This place was such a disappointment. I ordered the Chicken ""Feast"" with a side of potatoes and salad. The chicken was obviously not fresh and frozen beforehand. The tzatziki sauce was so viscous! Tzatziki is not supposed to be thick! The potatoes tasted like a salt grenade went off in my mouth. And the salad dressing tasted like Kraft's Italian dressing with some feta sprinkled in. Then there was a little pita chip on my plate. Where is the pita bread?!? That is essential to the dinner! Not this chip nonsense.If you think this is authentic Mediterranean food then you might as well think a Chinese buffet is authentic Chinese food.  They really sell the image well. Pictures of Greece all around, and a wine menu. Bravo. Sell an upscale image  so people will pay a higher premium. I get it. Great strategy. But the food speaks for itself. The food is garbage.

"2190 Bandywood DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"This will not replace my usual Greek place. We were over in the area & thought we'd try it. I love hummus & gyros. The place was just okay. Service is a little weird. It's at the counter, which is fine if it's a typical Greek place. But with the cost of the food double your typical place, the service should reflect that. The best part of the meal: The soft pillowy pita & hummus. The worst part: The lamb meat. Overdone & dried out. Charred. Also I prefer my gyro inside the pocket & not with the flatbread wrapped around. However if the meat had been delicious, it wouldn't be a big deal. Even though the menu doesn't mention, our gyros came with chips. Plain Ruffles, nothing spectacular.

"2190 Bandywood DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"In no way, shape or form am I well-versed in Mediterranean cuisine.  I am not an expert in what things are or are not supposed to taste like.  I do know what I like and I like Taziki's.  This was my first visit.  I was on a lunch run for a few of us at the office and this is what was suggested.  I am a ""go with the flow"" kind of girl, so I was all for trying someplace I had not been before.  I called in our order.  Personally, I got the lamb gyro.  It wasn't stuffed into the pita, but was more like a wrap instead.  However, the food all tasted fresh - the lettuce and cucumbers were crisp, the tomato ripe and it was not drenched in tzatziki sauce - instead it was dressed to perfection.  For my side, I had the pasta salad with feta.  It (the pasta salad) was okay, nothing over the top.  The star; however, was the appetizer of hummus my friend and I shared.  It was smooth, creamy and had that hint of lemon to it.  It was a delight to smear (I'm not a spreader, so to speak) over warm, soft pita.  I'd have licked the bowl, but that would have been rude, not to mention, disgusting.  So on my first visit, I was impressed.  There was a dedicated line for pick-ups and designated to-go parking to boot.  Bonus points on both of those!  The interior was clean, service was prompt and the place was filled to the gills.  I look forward to seeing what tasty treat I can get the next time I swing through.  I can; however, tell you, the hummus is definitely going to be on that list!",Taziki’s Mediterranean Cafe,6158731027,152 reviews,2013-11-06,"Hermitage, TN",/biz/tazikis-mediterranean-cafe-nashville-2,4.0,32,"Washington, DC",Kristina L.

"2190 Bandywood DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"Taziki's is a sweet little place that I have found in Green Hills.  I have eaten here for lunch and find the food to be pretty good.  The gyro wraps are soft and chewy and the produce is fresh.  If I can give you one pointer...  Go for the lamb!  It's worth every extra penny and is highlighted better than any other meat on the menu, thanks to the creamy tzatziki sauce.  I am a huge fan of tzatziki sauce in general and do wish theirs had a bit more cucumber, bit less dill... but overall it's a great compliment to seasonings they put on everything else.Check your sides before you leave if you're carrying out; the last two times I have ordered the tomato-cucumber salad and received the pasta salad (which is pretty good) instead.I just wish they didn't Americanize their name with the misspelling!  At least they don't cell it a ""Yuroh"" on the menu :)",Taziki’s Mediterranean Cafe,6158731027,62 reviews,2012-10-18,"Nashville, TN",/biz/tazikis-mediterranean-cafe-nashville-2,3.0,32,"Washington, DC",Charli J.

"2190 Bandywood DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"I am not a fan of traditional Mediterranean food. Sorry. I don't love olives, I can't get into stuffed grape leaves, and baklava is not my idea of a yummy dessert. Earlier this year, a friend from Alabama was raving about Taziki's (I believe it may have been started there?). I figured a Mediterranean joint that was successful in Alabama couldn't be all THAT authentic (sorry, Alabama natives), so I decided to give it a try. We went to the location on West End and I fell in love. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that there was a location in Green Hills, which came in handy as I needed to pick up dinner for a friend with a new baby on the way home from the dentist.LOCATION/ATMOSPHERE: The location is great - plenty of parking (or at least the times I've been for dinner), it's away from the hustle and bustle of Hillsboro Road and there is a cute little patio out front. Inside, the atmosphere is relaxing with dark woods and candles on each table. I assume the place fills up at lunch, but at dinnertime, it's pleasantly quiet and welcoming. I like a quick-service restaurant that dedicated a lot of attention to its dining area. It's not like eating at a McDonald's or a Chipotle.SERVICE: Other than witnessing an awkward flirtation by one of the staff members on a girl also waiting for a carry-out order, everyone at this location has been very nice and helpful.FOOD: At both the West End and Bandywood locations, I've enjoyed the food for the most part. The lemon herb chicken gyro is like the chicken fingers of gyros - simple and is a great introduction to non-Mediterranean fans. I like it okay - my most recent trip had a piece of chicken with bone in it, which kinda threw me off for the rest of my meal. But, overall, it's a solid go-to. My favorite entree, though, is the lamb and skordalio gyro. It's a little messy, but very yummy - especially if you like lamb on your gyro. The spicy jalapeno pimento cheese (obviously the entire menu is not strictly Mediterranean) is delicious, as is the hummus. The accompanying pita chips are amazing - if they don't put pita slices in the toaster in-house, don't tell me otherwise. They are yummy.I'll probably keep frequenting both locations of Taziki's for an inexpensive bite to eat with friends - as long as no more bones appear in my gyros.

My shrimp feast had 5 or 6 baby shrimp on it. The prices are reasonable, but if you eat an average amount, don't except to leave here stuffed. It's a moderate lunch sized portion.

Examples: dolmades were overstuffed with extremely spiced rice to the point you cannot even taste the grape leaf which is the whole point of the dish. Tjatjiki sauce was pathetic. Gyro was terrible. Nashville is generally very weak as a restaurant city and there is NO good ethnic restaurants. This no exception. Taziki fare is ok for what it is: grilled meats competently prepared; but Greek food it isn't. So as a grill I would rate it average plus, as a Greek restaurant I would rate it a zero.

"2190 Bandywood DrNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"Located on the site of the old Shintomi , I had high hopes for this chain restaurant. It's in my neighborhood, perfect for a quick lunch. I invited a friend and we met at 11.30 on a weekday. I entered, was a bit confused because I couldn't find any server to help me - located the cash register, cashier, and a server moments later.Having no idea whether to seat myself or ask for help, I said politely ""How does this work?"" The cashier barked ""I'll take your order now!"" Nonplussed, I stepped back and my friend said ""No, how does it work? do we get our own table?"" and the cashier again said ""I'll take the order now!!"" I finally took a deep breath and said ""Forgive us, we have not been here before. Do we seat ourselves, is there waiter service, where are the menus?"" At that point we were finally told to seat ourselves and given menus. My friend ordered a salad with chicken; I made the mistake of ordering the pork loin. We were quite specific - dressing on the side, blue cheese please, no dressing  or sauce on the pork. Although there were only two other tables seated, the waitress rushed away before we could tell her she'd brought the wrong dressing.  Portions were average, lettuce was what you'd expect from a chain restaurant. The chicken and pork, however, were so salty they were almost inedible. (And I love my salt!)When the manager asked how our meal was, we told him the truth. He explained that their recipes came from the main office, and he wasn't allowed to change them. My friend had eaten at another Tzatiki's, though, and said this was much much saltier. When she suggested he tell the chef not to add additional salt, he just shrugged.I really miss the days when a bad meal and polite complaint brought apologies instead of excuses! We won't be back.OH.

I waited until my second visit to write a review to make sure I got a consistent experience. On my first visit, I ordered the ""hot"" breast quarter. It was excellent, but could have been a little hotter for my liking. DISCLAIMER: I easily tolerate hot food. I love hot food. I want the pain...it's part of the experience. That said, the hot would be plenty hot for most folks. My co-worker, who is also a hot food lover, was satisfied with the hot. On my second visit, I went for what Helen's calls ""Hella Hot"". And yes...it's hot. Hot enough to get my nose running, my lips burning, and my eyes watering a bit. But not so hot that it masked the flavor of the chicken. I'm not a big fan of hot food that's just painfully hot. I enjoy the burn, but I want it to also be tasty so you can't wait to take the next bite even though you know it's gonna bite back. In my humble opinion, ""Hella Hot"" was just right. Plenty hot, but very flavorful. It also didn't leave a lasting painful burn like some hot food does.The chicken was cooked to perfection. Crispy skin, with juicy meat that wasn't overcooked. The spices were delicious. Hot, flavorful, and absolutely delicious when you get down to those two pieces of hot sauce soaked white bread.

Come on, Yelp, allow us to make that happen!We came here on a Saturday night for a relaxed dinner, and literally wobbled out from being so full of delicious Korean food!  We ordered 3 of our standard Korean favorites: seafood pancake, bim-bim bop, and spicy squid and vegetables.  The food came out hot, fresh and perfectly cooked.  The seafood pancake was HUGE and chock full of squid, shrimp and green onions and topped with a delicious sauce.  Our only complaint was that the pancake was a bit thick compared to others we've tried elsewhere (but we'll let that one go on account of the pancake being, overall, quite delicious).  The bim bim bop (my personal favorite) was good as well, full of veggies and accompanied by a perfectly spiced sauce.  I would have liked more beef in the dish, but it was otherwise very tasty.  The spicy squid dish had plenty of squid, big chunks of zucchini and a variety of other vegetables.  Our main courses were served with the standard Korean appetizers: kimchi, spicy daikon radish, bean sprouts, potatoes, and other fun dishes you just need to try to complete your experience.  The waitstaff was very friendly and eager to make our meal a good one.Both my fiance and I were spoiled by Koreatown in NYC, where we ate some of the best Korean food in the USA.  While Midori isn't quite up to par with the amazing Korean BBQ joints in New York, this is certainly some of the best Korean food we've found in Nashville.  It's definitely worth the 30-minute drive from Bellevue to fulfill our Korean food cravings.  We didn't try either, but the other Korean dishes, as well as the sushi, looked delicious.  We'll be back!",Midori Japanese Korean Restaurant,6158311203,126 reviews,2013-08-11,"Nashville, TN",/biz/midori-japanese-korean-restaurant-nashville,4.0,57,"Washington, DC",Tracy F.

Especially my mother was from south coast in Korea - their foods are a little more spicy and seasoned than people up further north due to warmer weather - and this suits my appetite very well.The atmosphere isn't the nicest and they don't have the nicest furniture but everything tastes great. All their ingredients are fresh and I was actually pretty impressed with the quality of raw fish they served, especially regarding this is Tennessee.I have not been disappointed by their food ever. I must be honest and point out their Japanese food is a little Koreanized but that is what I am used to so I love it, and it's not far off the charts from authentic Japanese food as some of the American-owned Japanese restaurants.My boyfriend's never been to Korea, and never tried Korean food but he loves the food here as well.

I tried it out and loved it so much I took a friend visiting from Australia a few days later and he loved the food as well. Unlike most places here in town they have a choice of 4 or 5 different types of sake (and soju if you are lucky). It's a small place, mom and pop nothing fancy but the food is far better than i expected. Service was attentive even though they were busy both times we went recently. It's not fast, there is a little lady in the kitchen cooking. team of one. don't get in a hurry good things take time. What really makes it a great experience for me is when the staff are willing to answer questions and make recommendations, and these folks are super nice and helpful. Several ladies came by to ask us how we liked everything and help us with the more exotic choices we made (they kept warning us to stir the hot pot so the rice wouldn't brown, but that is my favorite part!). The seafood pancake is an enormous yummy fried miracle. trust me if you like seafood/octopus you will love this. The ribs are awesome but you will have to fight the other people at your table for them. don't say i didn't warn you. If you go on friday night at 7 don't expect to be out of there in 30 minutes.

"5628 Nolensville PikeNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"Please allow me to validate all reviews that mentioned how bomb the spicy tuna roll is....yep, yep!  The best I've ever had, and that's saying a lot since I've eaten a LOT of sushi.  Maybe it's because the tuna is so fresh, maybe because they use my love, Sriracha (instead of wasabi which I despise)?  Maybe it's just because it's the best!I also made a successful foray into the Korean cuisine.  I sampled the spicy Korean seafood stew with noodles, and the hubs tried the seafood pancake.  Both were diggity.  Tip: if you're the average joe, order the seafood stew mild, but if you can handle some heat like me, then order it spicy.  My only criticism is that I didn't eat all the seafood in the stew immediately (mussels, octopus tentacles, shrimp), and by the time I got around to it all it was a little tough.  BUT, I would definitely order it again and just eat all the seafood first.  I'm not quite sure how they pulled it off, but the stew was still steaming hot after 20 minutes (and no, it was not in a stone pot!).  The seafood pancake was amazing, but the hubs would have prefered it as an appetizer.  While it was SO good - seafood cooked perfectly, seasoned spot-on, texture just right - it was just a lot of the same dish.As others have mentioned, the ambiance isn't the best - very bright, no music, slightly dingy - it was good enough.  Everything was very clean & tidy which is what catches my attention.  They also offer wine & beer which we of course had to partake in.  Also the Korean dishes aren't cheap, but they are worth it.  And I had a giant portion to take home.All in all, we'll certainly be back.  Amazing sushi AND great Korean food....how cool is that?",Midori Japanese Korean Restaurant,6158311203,201 reviews,2011-03-14,"Brentwood, TN",/biz/midori-japanese-korean-restaurant-nashville,4.0,57,"Washington, DC",Erin J.

Oh, what to say about the kimchi.  It was pickled sweet, and it had LOTS of reddish sauce dumped all over it.  The bean sprouts were good, but bland.  The cucumbers were spicy, sweet, and bland.  The broccoli was decent, but also bland.  *sigh*My one foray into Japanese was the edamame and that was both overcooked on the outside (WAY too hot!) and undercooked on the inside.  I was wondering if it had been freezer burnt, and then tried to be salvaged, it is was so bad.The service was pleasant enough, though our waiter was new and couldn't tell us much about some of the options.

The tenders tasted fresh battered. The waffle would have been delicious with no butter or syrup. I like a waffle batter that has flavor all by itself. I also tasted a biscuit and it was pretty good.The waitress was good, and the atmosphere was casual and family friendly.

The stale old smoke smell is a bit in your face, I won't deny, but I'm guessing that resorts back to the days where smoking and eating were hand in hand.  The service also was slightly lacking. I was nervous that being seated in front of the live band would limit our dinner conversation, but actually we scored by finding Forlorn Strangers, a new to Nashville bluegrass quartet. Anyway back to the food....I ordered a burger and onion rings, but lets be honest ... It was average at best. However, I also ordered  a pancake and some eggs for my one year old and DANG!!!

"1330 Dickerson PikeNashville, TN 37207",3.5,"Psssst...  This is not a dive.This is a little diner that is in very good condition and probably been here for decades.  It's not smelly, not dirty, the upholstery is not worn, neither are the floors. So calling it a dive is not a true statement.This is a little well established diner on Dickerson Pike, in the industrial area. Well known to locals, the place fills up very quickly at mealtime.Being a BIG fan of the TV show, ""Nashville,"" I really wanted to know where it was that Deacon and Coleman sat around discussing stuff in a booth with bright windows.  The place looked quaint.  So I was on the hunt to find this place.After questioning people, I was directed to Charlie Bob's on Dickerson Pike, right outside of downtown Nashville.  When I walked in, there were a few people in there, very quiet, TV on the wall was silent, chalkboard menu listed tons of items including ""milkshakes.""I grabbed a booth, looked at the menu, ordered the BIG ASS Thumper burger, sans the bun, lots of lettuce, pickle, mayo, and raw onion.. plus a side of sweet potato fries.Within minutes, cars drove up, parked and in walked suits, laborers, couples, Vandy suited people and the next thing you know, it's filled to capacity.  Just like that!I sat and read my phone, and within minutes, my meal came.  Waitress got so bogged down, I never saw her again.  I didn't get my pickles, mayo, or onions.. or lettuce. I never got a refill on my coffee or water.  I'm not going to penalize her for this. It became so crowded so quickly, she never got a chance to check to see if  I needed anything.  Sweet potato fries were hot and crunchy! Very good!After finishing my meal, I asked the cashier when a better time to come back would be, and she started telling me about all the things Charlie Bob does at night. I mean, she talked about chips and salsa, queso, open jam, all the fish you can eat, you name it, she was listing all the things that happen at this place.I will come back one Wednesday evening and check out the open mike, try another dish, and hopefully get better service.

The Food: I had one egg, bacon, biscuits/gravy, hashbrowns and coffee for right around $6.  Yes, $6, the price of your Starbucks latte this morning.  The biscuits were so light and fluffy, if I ever had the chance to eat a cloud--  this is what I would imagine it tasting like. All joking aside, it was probably the best biscuit I've ever had in my life.  The rest of the meal was just as I expected, greasy southern breakfast goodness.  Looking forward to going back and trying some of the non-breakfast items.The Service:While I'm pretty sure the waitress didn't smile at us once, she was still timely, consistent, and I never had an empty cup of coffee.  Not too shabby.If you are like most people I know in Nashville, you haven't made the venture out to Charlie Bob's, and you're missing out!  Get out and get you some quality southern diner fare today!",Charlie Bob’s Restaurant,6152622244,22 reviews,2013-02-13,"Nashville, TN",/biz/charlie-bobs-restaurant-nashville,4.0,38,"Washington, DC",Matt N.

As the customers were getting there food and seemed happy. I had ate there a week earlier got a burger and fries that were okay and after telling my wife not to worry about eating we could eat there it left us both very disappointed and starved. I will be back for the Comedy but I won't ever order food there again. Finally when I went to pay for my meal the same waitress kept looking over me as I had my money in my hand to pay my tab.

Bad news: it's a cut below Waffle House, quality wise. Maybe it was a bad day, I say. It's right across the street and it's cheap, I say. Let's give them another chance, I say.So we do, a week later. This time we order dinner. Fried chicken tenders for her and fried catfish for me. First of all, they tell me it'll be ten minutes and it's actually 25. Not cool. Then they're out of the sides we want because they turned the steam trays off or something. Then the food is a step below their breakfast food, which was already a step below greasy spoon diner food. My catfish was way over-fried, making it chewy and inedible, and the chicken tenders had breading just falling off of them. And the ranch that came with them tasted a bit funky.Two meals: one three star experience (generously speaking with a boost from the food value), and one one star experience (which is to say I'd have sent the entire meal back and gone home had we been dining in).Eat here if you dare, but be forewarned. Truthfully, it's convenient enough that I'd probably dine in and eat breakfast again (if my girlfriend were out of town or died tragically in a car explosion) -- I'm very lazy and the place IS right across the street. But I wouldn't expect to enjoy it.",Charlie Bob’s Restaurant,6152622244,17 reviews,2011-09-13,"Nashville, TN",/biz/charlie-bobs-restaurant-nashville,2.0,38,"Washington, DC",JT S.

I recently visited with my boyfriend on crutches and the manager ran to the front door to open the door for him. Not necessary, but very much appreciated all the same.

"7114 Memphis-Bristol HwyNashville, TN 37221",4.5,"I've driven by Sam's a million times but never stopped in. Mediterranean food in Nashville is atrociously vanilla at best (in ""pop-in"" store fronts that is). I was starved so I set my phaser on mediocrity and popped inside. Boy was I was in for a surprise. The 6 or 7 people in queue went fast. Friendly older guy took my order of combo plate (rice, gyro meat, chicken, pita, Greek salad). Salad ingredients looked (and were) very fresh. I cringed at first that the meat was coming from a covered tin instead of being cooked fresh. (it was 1:30ish, who knows how long had it been there? Would it be dry?) Turns out the meat was very fresh. Gyro meat was especially tasty, just enough flavorful spice to eat on its own with frequent pauses to enjoy the taste. Chicken was safely tasteful, if not uneventful. Definitely fresh, tender, and a kind of BBQ moist (if that makes sense...all of that a plus) but the ""spices"" seemed to only color the meat, no burst of  yummy like its plate date, the gyro meat. Rice was perfectly cooked. Firm, moist, a hair more flavor than the chicken (although rice and chicken together made up for their individual blandiness). Pita was a warm, balance of fluffy and dense. Substance without being a brick, also fresh, which seems to be the running theme of the meal. Portions were big, and I only spent $8 for the combo and drink. I'll definitely be back (construction worker guy in the next booth had an awesome looking Philly sandwich I'd like to try!) My Nashville gyro dry spell seems to finally be over.

"7114 Memphis-Bristol HwyNashville, TN 37221",4.5,"I have already reviewed Athens, across the street from Sam's, and felt it was only fair to review Sam's, one of my favorite take out restaurants in Nashville. I like both of the restaurants, for different reasons.If I had to pick the best take out Greek in Nashville, it would be Chicago Style Gyros on Harding, but it is on the other side of town. Sam's is a close seconjd and much closer to the house. IN Bellevue, Sam's is the best take out, Athens (across the street) the best sit down.Most times I go into Sam's the owner is there, serving food. He greets everyone with a smile and makes you feel at home. The portions at Sam's are ample, perhaps even too much so. If you order the gyro platter, you get a large portion of rice, nearly completely hidden with gyro. It also comes with a side salad and you get to choose the toppings. I would personally skip the ranch dressing (homemade, nice) and go for the tzadziki (cucumber yoghurt -- yum).My favorite is to get a sampler. For a bit more, you can add gyro and you still get more than enough gyro to fill your stomach. The hummus is very nice and creamy. The dolmades are very nice. The falafel is decent enough, although I have had better (I still order from time to time). I am grab some of the spanikopita (spinach cheese and filo) from time to time.The best part of Sam's is the price value ratio.

The portions are huge, the gyro meat and chicken are always juicy and fresh. Falafel is good, I've had better, but only because it was fried a little hard for my taste, but I'm also not the biggest falafel fan in general. The hummus is silky smooth with a nice touch of olive oil on top. Stuffed grape leaves are magnificent and perfectly spiced. I always get the gyro platter or gyro salad, both 6.87+ tax. Both options provide enough food for 2 meals! Just as important to me as food quality is service and Sam's never disappoints. I've been a frequent customer (at least a couple times a month) for a few years now and it never fails that the owner already remembers my order when I step up to the counter. I even took my parents in once when they were visiting town (they're requested to go back several times now) they were new to Mediterranean food and  were unsure of what to order. After the meal, the owner inquired if they enjoyed the food and they raved. Since then, he often asks me how my folks are and sends his regards to them during the holidays.

"7114 Memphis-Bristol HwyNashville, TN 37221",4.5,"This is one of a few places I will eat at on my occasional way through Bellevue. The other main one is Penn Station kitty corner from Sam's. This place is also known as ""The Sauce"" because of the way the owner, taking his place behind the employee, will patiently instruct him in the fine art of adding sauce (i.e., tzatziki) into the pita gradually and mix the ingredients about two or three times during the preparation of the sandwich: ""Sauce."" (Nods. A couple more ingredients.) ""Sauce."" (A couple more ingredients are mixed in. An approving nod.) ""Sauce."" etc. The service, to say the least, is friendly and attentive. However, it is advisable not to let one's guard down, or one will be persuaded to accept the ""homemade ranch"" instead of the tzatziki. It is not as good. If you don't want to bust your belly, it is possible to get a light snack here, too. In such cases, I like to get a couple warm, sliced pitas and the smallest-sized cup (about 4 or 6 oz.) of hummus with a little olive oil drizzled on top, and wash it down with an unsweet tea.

I'm not kidding, he once stopped mid-way through making my gyro to watch part of a soccer game. Finally, the tables and bench seating rarely get wiped down.

The tabbouleh is clearly home-made and it is absolutely delicious, with a nice dominance of parsley and mint as opposed to bulgur.  The hummus is quite peanut-buttery and seems homemade, but lacks some of the lightness that I associate with the dip, while the felafels are at times quite hard to bite down on. As I am disinclined to eat beef, it also bothers me when the water comes with pieces of beef strips stuck on like remoras. Still its cheap, and for the people in Bellevue it gives me a bit more choice than the usual line of fast foods.  For some reason every time I visited the television was on with some CNN broadcast involving some issue in the Middle East: first the start of the Arab Spring, then the Libyan War, then bin Laden's death, then fighting in Yemen.  Very strange.",Sam’s Kabab Gyro,6156623114,110 reviews,2011-05-31,"Nashville, TN",/biz/sams-kabab-gyro-nashville,3.0,68,"Washington, DC",Wayne H.

That being said, even if you don't like country music you will have a blast here.Top 5 Reasons Why I LOVE Honky Tonk Central1) You never know who you are going to meet here. Seriously, I have met people from all over the world here! One time I had a conversation with an astronaut from Australia. I know locals get sick of the tourists, but honestly I love them!2) The crowd is always rowdy. If you are looking for chill vibes then don't come here. The crowd is always so much fun! Everyone is mingling, dancing, drinking and it makes for an awesome environment.3) Celebrations get special treatment. We came here for my friends 21st and ended up on stage/getting a ton of free drinks. I always see bachelorette parties here and it is a great place to celebrate anything.4) They don't solely play country music. There is some rock, top 40 and throwbacks into the mix. I always love it when they play the old 90's song! And everyone goes to the stage and dances! Seriously love this place.5) Three stories, three different vibes, and three balconies. Enough said!PS: 1st floor is where a lot of the older people stay and they play a lot of 80's rock/famous older songs. 2nd floor is a lot more chill. 3rd floor is my favorite, a lot of young people, locals and newer country/music.

There was always great live music (mostly acoustic when the sun was out). The bartenders are nice.I had to eat lunch here out of necessity, and it was surprisingly decent for bar food. The fried catfish basket was a lot of food, and was nice and flakey. I also substituted the fries for onion rings.They had a problem with beer delivery due to the weather - they only had Yazoo Dos Perros, but that's not a problem because Dos Perros is delicious.Sadly, I was unable to attend one of the crazy nights here because they never opened up the second and third floors again after the storm while I was there.So basically, to me, it was a low-key, family-friendly music bar with acceptable food.

We got the fried pickles, chicken nachos, and tator tots.  Food came with paper plates and plastic ware, totally appropriate.  The Tators took me back to my 1st grade cafeteria and I LOVED IT!! Perfectly fried and sans the grease! The fried pickles are piping HOT so wait for a minute before you burn your taste buds..

"329 BroadwayNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"So overall, this is a good bar that you can count on enjoying. But there's one main reason this place isn't getting 5 stars from me: the female waitresses/bartenders are pretty reliable with trying to rip people off. Honestly, it's happened 4/5 times I've come to this bar. By this I mean, shorting me on $10-20 change or bringing/charging me for drinks I didn't order. Seriously, just remember to double check your bill/change every time, ESPECIALLY when you're paying cash. If they leave before you can count your change and make any corrections, they'll insist they brought you the right amount and refuse to give you the rest of what you're owed.  Otherwise, Honky Tonk is where I take friends who come to visit Nashville for the first time. It's a fun bar-- there's usually a fun crowd, night and day with both mostly tourists. There's three floors/stages to check out when you get bored or aren't feeling the vibe on one floor. Decent drinks and bar food when you need it. I usually have a good time here, but having to keep on eye on my bill and trying to reason with them when I catch them leaves me with a bitter taste in my mouth every time. Horrible service.

"329 BroadwayNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"Honky Tonk Central is proof that Nashville has a *lot* of tourists. Don't get me wrong: I appreciate the fact that HTC helped to revitalize lower Broad (I remember when there wasn't much Downtown that wasn't on 2nd Ave) but this sort of Nashville experience is definitely one you're going to want to wait and bring your out of town friends or hit up as part of a lower Broad crawl. I can see the appeal HTC has for tourists but it's the local landscape that has me a bit confused.*By now, you know the score: no cover (much appreciated), multiple levels, big crowds of folks committed to woo-hooing their way to a good time, live music that may or may not be pleasing to the ear, tvs, drinks of fluctuating strength, etc. You know what to expect. If, for some reason, you find yourself drawn to HTC, make your way to the balcony. The breeze and view are the star attractions at this Downtown Nashville mainstay. To be able to look out and see the sea of humanity bathed in neon and walking the street in droves is a pretty powerful scene for anyone who can remember a time when such a scene wasn't common. HTC may not be my cup of tea (or, jug of moonshine) but I recognize its importance in the Downtown Nashville landscape and appreciate its role in changing a dead scene into a thriving one. It may not be a place I'd go every weekend but when I have friends in town, I wouldn't doubt that I'll be sucked into its orbit... along with the rest of you. You can't fight the moonlight.*Which brings me back to my opening sentence: there are so many tourists coming to Nashville, HTC doesn't have to worry about a locals contingent.",Honky Tonk Central,6157429095,1642 reviews,2015-06-03,"Nashville, TN",/biz/honky-tonk-central-nashville,3.0,209,"Washington, DC",Johnny T.

"329 BroadwayNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"Walking into Honky Tonk Central, all I could think was, ""This is my worst nightmare."" If you're not a major fan of crowds & country music, this might not be the bar for you. As my friends & I (a bachelorette party) wove our way through the first-floor throngs of people, we passed deeply accented folks wearing cowboy hats & flannel shirts, all fist-pumping to a live rendition of a VERY country song I'd never heard before. It was like a slow-motion scene from a movie, looking into all these people's eyes & seeing how much joy they felt at being there while I felt *completely the opposite.* Oh my God, it was gonna be a bad night.But this is a four-star review, see? Which means things changed. This bar has multiple floors, & when we got to the second floor, we found things to be a lot more chill, much more our style. Did I mention that we're all Northerners? Country isn't quite our jam (why did we come to Nashville? Beats me), so we were thrilled to find that the live music on the second floor was more rock with a country twist - Tom Petty, Rolling Stones, Johnny Cash, The Eagles. The kind of music you know in your soul. We claimed a corner of the room - which wasn't nearly as busy as downstairs - where we piled our coats & got to dancing. We had a great time, & we got fairly hammered because this bar is surprisingly inexpensive.The people-watching is great, too. The second floor was filled with all kinds of characters, & the atmosphere in the bar was friendly & low-key enough that we struck up conversations & danced with some of them. Lots of interesting folks & good tunes. But beyond all that, it was a great space for dancing & not giving a damn who else was around, the way a bachelorette party & a good vacation ought to be.The only negative is that the top floors close earlier than the first floor, so we were all sent back downstairs at some point. My friends & I still had a bucket of beers, so we settled into that terrible downstairs crowd to finish off our drinks before heading home. While we were watching the live band, one of my friends was robbed - like, someone just pickpocketed her wallet right out of her purse. She felt it, but thought it was because the place was so busy. By the time she realized what had happened, the perpetrator was long gone. As she sobbed & I made my way to a bouncer to tell them what had happened, some guy overheard me saying what had just happened, & he passed her wallet over to me. He'd found it on the floor, minus $150 cash but with all cards & her IDs still inside. It was the best-case scenario after being robbed, to be sure, but it was a low point of our visit. In other words: When you find yourself at Honky Tonk Central, grab a bucket of beer, head up to the second floor, prepare to dance, & don't forget to bring a very, very secure purse.",Honky Tonk Central,6157429095,320 reviews,2015-03-11,"Cleveland, OH",/biz/honky-tonk-central-nashville,4.0,209,"Washington, DC",Kate B.

"329 BroadwayNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"We had time for just a few songs (and drinks) on Broadway before heading over to Monnel's to stuff ourselves silly and ended up at Honky Tonk Central due to there being enough room without having to wait in a line. We could easily tell upon entering that this bar catered to the out-of-town crowd. Hints: the layout, a half dozen bachelorette parties sprawling throughout the three floors of the bar and the general ""lets get shitfaced"" vibe.  We found a perch at the bar and ordered our drinks - ginger and Jameson and a Bloody Mary. Yes, it was 5 p.m. and yes, I wanted a Bloody Mary. Yes, the bartender could have looked at me a little less like I had two heads. The drinks were standard - nothing to write home about yet no complaints. Unfortunately, we must have arrived at a bad time on the schedule because live music was only playing for about 50% of the time we were there - est. 1.5 hours. Lucky for us, the remaining 50% of the time was filled with a drunken shitshow of a fella from Columbus, Ohio who seemed to take a great interest in my boyfriend and me. Visual: fairly sober us trapped by spitting, red-cheeked, and offensive him. The bar probably should have cut him off. Don't get me wrong. I am down to get down, it's just that in between making offensive statements he probably could have wet himself without thinking twice about it.In conclusion, great bar for your standard tourist-style Nashville visit.

The live music is of course awesome and a band on each floor is pretty cool. I thought that the bands would drown each other out, but the floors are very distinct. We stayed on the second floor for most of our first visit by the balcony which was nice. Our 2nd and 3rd visit was before and after the Browns/Titans football game and it was awesome how many Browns fans were there. It was also pretty awesome that Honky Tonk Central was one of only 2 bars that were open around 10am. I'm not sure why they other bars are not open but Honky Tonk definitely caters to the ""early drinker"". It does get crowded there, I mean SUPER crowded, so that can wear on you a little but it's definitely worth a stop if you're in Nashville.

"329 BroadwayNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"Stopped in with what felt like the whole city of Lexington, KY to watch the SEC semifinals. Wildcat blue as far as the eye could see:) 3 levels of standing room only (if you consider sardines in a can ""standing room"") Anyway, buckets of domestic light beer were going for $30 which I guess is part tourist attraction and part supply and demand. I think on a less busy day it would be a great place to get gouged for beer and watch a game or see a band on the first level. It was just a little too much so we only stayed for about half the game before we bailed for a less busy spot. But the energy was great and it was def Wildcat friendly:) I would go again.

"329 BroadwayNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"A humongous tourist trap full of music, booze, and women. So naturally, I walked in.For the most part, our group of friends which included a happy couple and two (soon-to-be) bachelors had a great time. The cover band was mediocre, but the song selection was awesome covering various pop hits from Guns N' Roses, Lil' Wayne, Toby Keith, and many others. The crowd was diverse, but for the most part got along. And some nice southern girls even bought me a shot. That rarely happens in Man Jose (and other areas of the Sillyc*ck Valley).My only knock on the place is that my group of dipsomaniacs went on a weeknight, so they shut down the top two floors. No problem (since the first floor had a nice crowd). But we were all on the bottom level surrounding a large circle bar with only one bartender. And she just happened to be the most inefficient bartender of all time. It was painful to watch her pour drinks and struggle to take bottle caps off of beers and mess up orders. They probably could have brought in Walter White's son Junior (aka Flynn) from Breaking Bad and we probably would have received faster service. Luckily, they brought in a professional that made drinks fast and took four bottle caps off in approximately 1.7 seconds. Seriously, she was poppin' bottles like a mainstream hip hop artist. And eventually, we were poppin' bottles to a cover band covering Lil' Wayne in the middle of Music City.Good times.",Honky Tonk Central,6157429095,1004 reviews,2014-10-16,"San Jose, CA",/biz/honky-tonk-central-nashville,3.0,209,"Washington, DC",Archie G.

"329 BroadwayNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"For live music- 5 stars! Has a huge stage for performers and it's a large bar for group gatherings but as much as I appreciated the entertainment, I would be happy going to a smaller more intimate bar where it's easy to get a drink and you can enjoy the music with out being surrounded by a loud environment. For food, it's bar food. The service is nothing special. The margarita special for 5 dollars was watered down. I would definitely go hit up a BBQ joint then eat here if you are looking for dinner. For night life it's like a college party. Crazy, crazy lines with a younger crowd so I would just walk down until you don't have to wait in line and can actually breathe in whatever bar you get into.

Their lead singer was a woman named Autumn Reynolds. She had such an amazing voice!! She could sing any country song well, if not better than the original singer. By the end of the night, major girl crush was developed. The only reason why this receives 4 stars instead of 5 was that it was slow to get drinks, but that's somewhat expected for a touristy bar in Nashville.

"329 BroadwayNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"Honky Tonk Central was the first bar we walked into after arriving in Nashville and I think maybe the best of all the bars we went to. We had so much fun (we tried to get back here over and over during our stay, but it was just too busy each time we tried). We arrived while the Titans were playing on TV, and live music on stage. We immediately got a seat at the bar and ordered our beer. I ordered a local brew (well a few), Yazoo Pale Ale. We sat at the bar for a few hours and listened to the music. I really enjoy country music, my boyfriend however is not a fan, but even he enjoyed the whole honky tonk experience. Corey Johnson was on the stage, he was a great singer, kept the crowd engaged. At one point a couple left to go watch their team play (Saints-paying against the Browns) as they walked out, Corey asked where they were going and told them if they left, their team would lose, it was all in good fun but it turned out great for Cleveland fans, because they left and their team lost.  The Browns won that day! Wow does that mean that now we're going to have to go to Nashville and listen to live country music every time the Brown's play? Haha!The bar has several floors, although we only visited the first. The ground floor has giant windows all around, so you get the bright lights from outside, and don't feel like you're missing out on a nice warm day. We only ordered drinks, not sure if they had food.

"329 BroadwayNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"With 3 levels and 2 live bands Honky Tonk Central is 1 cool bar among the pack in downtown Nashville. It's hard to miss thanks to a prime corner spot on Broadway. As with most bars, we had no idea what to expect before strolling over to ""check it out."" What we found was a bar packed with tables full of people drinking, laughing, and moving to the music. We grabbed spots at the one table near the back and fit right in.Well drinks were $7, so, it wasn't the cheapest spot in the area, but the service was quick and the small drink strong. Because the crowd was into the band, it was impossible to not have a good time.

"329 BroadwayNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"Honky Tonk Central is a great time. There are three big floors of live, local bands. I was truly blown away by the talent. Each band played four hour sets non-stop, and then when they were finished, the next band would set up. It was incredible! My favorite of the weekend was the Harold Allen Band, but there were so many other great ones. I felt spoiled. The layout of the venue is awesome, with big, open floor to ceiling windows that have balcony railings which provide for a really cool indoor but yet somewhat-outdoor vibe. Service was hit or miss. We scored with John, who took care of us on Saturday. He appeared out of nowhere every time we needed something, and he was as sweet as could be. On Sunday, our service was really spotty. We would have been better off just going to the bar and ordering there. But in all fairness, we only saw one girl working the entire second floor. The beer selection is limited but when I session drink I tend to go for the easy stuff anyway (pro tip!). That said, the beers got progressively warmer as our Saturday tenure wore on. I don't know if they couldn't get those domestics on ice fast enough for the busy crowd or what, but by the end of the evening I was icing down my drinks in a cup of ice water.

Therefore, the only aspect I can judge about the Honkey Tonk is through drinks and music and both were some of the best I experienced in Nashville. The drinks weren't watered down as they are at most bars, yet they weren't too strong so they tasted great. However, the music was the true gem of this place. There are three floors and each floor had great music. However, the third floor was my favorite. I am a country fan, but my boyfriend is more of a classic rock fan. The band that was playing covered country (of course) and classic rock which he loved. It was impossible not to get up and dance even for my boyfriend who never wants to dance. It was very crowded but perhaps because I am 24 I didn't mind it and found it was more crowded at the other bars.

"329 BroadwayNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"Pretty fun bar that on many nights has three floors of entertainment with open balconies that let you watch the drunks make their way down Broadway, just be sure to bring small change.The reason for the two star rating is that during my last two visits, two different bartenders tried to scam me. The first was a classic over-charge on my credit card which the bartender said her manager would have to correct and she had no idea where he was so I could ""either sign it or wait like twenty minutes."" The second instance I paid cash and the bartender never brought back my change ($20 for a single beer.) Ten minutes later I was able to get her attention and she said she had assumed it was tip, then tried to bring the wrong change.

A guy from one of these parties pushed me off a stool, which resulted in me falling into another customer. A waitress whom I had noticed was incredibly annoyed all night by observing her scream at customers to get out of her way - proceeded to call me a rude bitch. Two things I have to say about this...1. I have been in the service industry for over ten Years and therefore have an incredible amount of respect for people in this business. 2. I have dealt with some major jerks myself - but rule #1 - you never curse at a customer. The door guy extinguished the situation and he could not have been nicer.

We just went again tonight and I was really looking forward to it, but ended up leaving after a couple minutes. I love music and like live music loud, but this was just way too loud and even I couldn't handle it. There weren't many people in there anyway, and no one was dancing at all. I can't say I don't like this place, because I'd probably try it again if I was staying, but only on a Friday or Saturday night and if the music was good. I think that would like to try the other floors as well to have that experience next time. Hopefully next time I could update the review with a better score :)",Honky Tonk Central,6157429095,108 reviews,2013-01-20,"Nashville, TN",/biz/honky-tonk-central-nashville,3.0,209,"Washington, DC",Brittany S.

"1526 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"This was the most lousy, apathetic service I have ever had. I am not hard to please and fast to praise. But this place... I will never go back.Our server was rude and rushed with us from the beginning, like she had something better to do. I asked for the ginger said but add avacado. She brings me a totally different salad, and when I asked for what I'd ordered, she made a big stink about taking it back and then mouthed off about us to another server. We made it clear that we could hear her and that it was not our fault that the wrong item came out. I did not expect an apology for bringing the wrong thing (I mean, couldn't hurt, right?) but to talk about your table ten feet away from it is rude, especially when we have done nothing wrong.I also asked for vegetables with brown rice. She said they come with fried rice. I said, ""But you have brown rice on the menu, if you can please just substitute it. Even if it costs more."" She finally says ok. Everyone finishes their salad and move to entrees. It takes ages, but I finally get my correct salad. Everyone else at the table is nearly finished with everything by the time she sets a bowl of veggies on the table in front of me, then hurries away. I did not even have time to ask about the brown rice that was supposed to be with it. Yet another 15 or so minutes later, as she walks by I call her over and ask where the brown rice is, and she rudely says, ""It's coming"" and walks away again, like I'm a huge bother for asking for what I ordered 45 minutes ago. Everyone finishes their meals as my veggies get cold waiting for the rice. Another 15 or 20 minutes later, she comes back to say, ""We can't make brown rice right now."" (As they were not getting ready to close, they simply did not ""want"" to. But they are the ones who took so long and pushed us to closing time... we were there plenty early. At this point the veggies are cold and I am missing half of my dinner, so I tell her to just take it off the ticket and I will eat elsewhere. No one comes to apologize for the mess ups and bad service. No one offers to discount the table or anything to make it right. And, in fact, she charges my husband an extra $1.50 for some condiment or something he wanted. So they treat us like dirt, then nickel and dime us. I could not leave this place fast enough.

"1526 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,I got it. This is Nashville and it isn't exactly known for sushi. Yes... this place of variety between the various tempuras and a gazillion sushi options. The service is super friendly and fast. But ultimately it is about the sushi:1. It is okay fresh - but nothing better than I have had in most Nashville places2. Awkwardly off temperature at times... as in rather warm riceAdd that to how its really difficult to park here and the loud music inside can be decently annoying - I wouldn't come to this place unless I was here for a quick stop and was walking distance.DO NOT GO HERE ON A DATE!!!

I went in not expecting great sushi, but was pleasantly surprised that their rolls were very generously sized and the fish was decently fresh. I stopped in with a friend around 8pm and the service was smooth. We sat at the bar and got our food within 10 minutes of ordering. I split two rolls (Alaskan and over the Rainbow) with the friend for $20 (including tax/tip). There was a substantial amount of sashimi in the rolls - something that I always look out for at typical sushi joints. Overall, I have no complaints about my experience here.

I also enjoyed the wide variety of items (there were even rice-free rolls, for those on low-carb diets), and the prices were reasonable. While ""good sushi for Nashville"" is a different standard than ""good sushi for Seattle,"" this was definitely on the high end of the sushi spectrum for Nashville.

"1526 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I am sad to write this review, as Sushi Yobi has been one of our favorite sushi spots in Nashville. Before I begin, I should qualify my opinion with the caveate that my evaluation is focused largely on the sushi.  By sushi I mean raw fish. We realize that the numerous variates of ""fried cream cheese, fake king-crab and gobs of spicy mayonnaise rolls"" soaked in lower sodium soy sauce are quite yummy.  But, I am evaluating primarily on the raw fish part, not the deep-fried tapas that passes for ""sushi"" at so many restaurants.With that being said I am sad to report that the quality of the sushi has declined to the point where it is slightly below average, and the service has dropped to well below average.To wit, my yellow tail rolls came with little ""chips"" of yellow tail as opposed to the finger cuts that I had become accustomed to here.  I suspect these were the remnants from someone else's sashimi.  Same for the Alaska roll - filled with chips of salmon - not so fresh either. Salad came with only a hint of dressing. Sake arrived with the saran wrap still clinging to the carafe (because they microwaved it to heat it). Carafe was hot, but sake was not. Sent it back...microwaved again, now hot - but they didn't refill the carafe, so we paid $10 for half a small carafe of sake. Salads were $4.50 a piece, so with tip we were gouged for nearly $60.00, and left hungry.",Sushiyobi,6152556122,58 reviews,2012-01-15,"Nashville, TN",/biz/sushiyobi-nashville,3.0,61,"Washington, DC",Mike J.

Nobu.  This is just really, really good sushi that is re-donc-you-less-ly (sound it out people) inexpensive.  Located close to Vandy and Music Row, we hit this place up for a bachelorette party.  With 8 demanding semi-intoxicated women, the service was fast and the food was excellent.  I ordered a grilled beef salad which was located on the menu right beside seaweed salad which I happened to know was a wee little tea cup saucer sized dish.  Well, turns out not so much for the grilled beef which was a full size jumbo salad  The key to ordering this is to ensure you don't get it as an appetizer when you are surrounded by hungry females.  The two bites I got in were amazing though - great, thin cut steak with a teriyaki marinade that was subtle. For dinner, I got the crispy shrimp with cream cheese roll -sooo yummy.  Ambiance isn't amazing, but it beats the pants of Ken's Sushi, my other go-to place so I can't take points off for that.  Although I do have to say it's likely not going to be an amazing date place but rather an excellent low key lunch.  Amazingly, every single person at the table loved their food, and that's a first.  And, not wanting to give this place undo credit, and feeling that extra 'Yelp Elite pressure', I opted to go back the following week during the cold light of day without a buzz and was equally impressed.  For super fun, be sure to hit their website for cute home touches where they offer you ""Direction"" and ""Reservation"" reflecting either a total loathing of plural or a cute homey authenticity that defines this place.",Sushiyobi,6152556122,272 reviews,2011-09-26,"Nashville, TN",/biz/sushiyobi-nashville,5.0,61,"Washington, DC",BethAnn S.

I would recommend ordering the Music Circle Roll for you fried lovers and the Pink Lady for those of you who like a little bit of everything.  The prices are fairly high, around $25 per person if you order an appetizer, salad, one roll, and a beverage.  I'm willing to pay that much for this sushi!  It's delicious! Other than one server, who we affectionately call ""The Mean Girl"", the service has always been friendly. We're usually there a couple of hours and they never try to push us out the door.    Thank goodness for this place.  If I hadn't been dragged here by friends six years ago, I would be missing out on a lot of sushi tastiness.",Sushiyobi,6152556122,113 reviews,2011-07-12,"Nashville, TN",/biz/sushiyobi-nashville,5.0,61,"Washington, DC",LM P.

I know it is probably difficult to get fresh fish daily in a landlocked city like Nashville, but still I couldn't help feeling like my $40+ ticket was a bit overpriced.  Sushiyobi in my opinion rivals some of the better sushi I have had in Nashville.  I will be back, but I still think Peter's Sushi in Brentwood is better, but it is a bit of a drive.  For cheaper sushi in this general area Zumi Sushi is also a good spot.",Sushiyobi,6152556122,15 reviews,2011-03-15,"Nashville, TN",/biz/sushiyobi-nashville,4.0,61,"Washington, DC",Jacob G.
"1526 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"The first time I went here, I left a huge fan of this place. The Philly and Music City roll are delicious! I ordered mine for pick-up, but the contact that I had with the staff was pleasant. I went there again right before I came home, and called in my order about 10 minutes before closing. The woman on the phone said she'd have to ask the chef and see if they could take my order (again, for take-out). I definitely understand that; working retail, there are people that pull that kind of thing all the time and make a long trip of it. My main complaint about that interaction was the guilt trip I received after the chef said it would be alright for me to order. I said, very clearly, that I understood if it was too late. They're about to close, I get it. If you say you'll take my order, then just take it. If it's that much trouble that close to closing, then say that you can't and I'll be happy to get my food elsewhere. Overall, the quality of the food I ordered was great. The customer service was decent, but I didn't order a side of guilt with my sushi, so go ahead and hold on to that next time.

"1526 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Pretty standard. I never noticed this place until I had a lunch date with a friend who worked on Music Row, which probably makes this the central reason why people come here. And sure, it has its little things that make it unique and personal, but those things don't seem to have broken through the barrier to be considerable competition to some of Nashville's other sushi houses.    But sushi isn't really that demanding if you're up for whatever. They have the regular rolls you see everywhere, and the cook's special additions to the menu. I'm an Eel & Avocado kind girl, which can either be cooked to perfection or cooked enough then slathered in Eel sauce as a cover up. Unfortunately, Sushi Yobi leans towards the latter prep style, BUT they do have fresh Salmon Roe. That alone gives me reason to not kick up a fuss if I have to go there again.

The Hawaiian was very good too, but I'm new to fruit on my sushi, I prefer the spicy stuff!Rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because we only had 3 people and stood by watching as table after table of patrons got up and left while their tables just sat dirty. I was on the verge of wiping down a table myself when the 'hostess' finally sat us. Instead of the originally quoted 15 min wait it took about 40 minutes to get a table. Usually we would just grab a drink and shut up but we couldnt manage to get the bartender's attention either...Once we finally got a seat, the service was great and surprisingly fast.

All was well until the server came over to our table, threw down the check and told us quite rudely that there must be a mistake because we didn't tip enough and usually we tip more.

People were also waiting about 30 to 40 minutes just to get served.and the food is good but not exactly to die for (unlike FIDOs)... It is pretty much your standard higher end coffee shop with breakfast option.Yes there bread is fresh... and they even slice... but its is just as good as Panera! This is however a great study place with blazing fast free internet so it might just work out on slower day (rainy... hail storm?? blizzard??),Provence Breads & Cafe,6153860363,226 reviews,2015-01-17,"Atlanta, GA",/biz/provence-breads-and-cafe-nashville-3,3.0,135,"Washington, DC",Hall W.

"1705 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"Oh having Provence so close to me will not be a good thing. I have been wanting to go in for a few months now since I moved to Hillsboro Village but just haven't until one day I made my sister go in with me. All of the pastries looked great...the ones we could see at least. There was so much condensation on the glass that we could barely see some of the pastries they had. I was drawn to the fruit tart. It looked so good with the blackberries, strawberries and blueberries on top of vanilla cream and a shortbread crust. It sounded amazing! My sister love macarons so she got one of those. I also ordered a cinnamon macaron along with my fruit tart. The guy at the register was friendly. He asked if I wanted my treats to go or on a plate. Then, when I said I wanted them to go he asked if I wanted a bag. I was fine with holding the box in my hand. Besides, I wanted to see how great my pastries looked. Once we stepped outside I realized that he did not give me a macaron. I am not sure what he gave me quite yet. A cinnamon roll maybe? I was a little disappointed that I didn't get what I ordered but I am willing to give it a try. I tried my fruit tart later that night and it was just as good as I had imagined it would be. The fruit was perfect with just the slight sweetness of the vanilla cream. I normally do not like crusts on anything but when I saw that it was shortbread I got excited. it did not disappoint either. I cannot talk about the wait time for drinks or the food since I only got pastries to go but I will definitely be back for that fruit tart and to try more. I like that they have a happy hour where you can get a slice of cake and a latte for $4.",Provence Breads & Cafe,6153860363,130 reviews,2014-10-14,"Atlanta, GA",/biz/provence-breads-and-cafe-nashville-3,4.0,135,"Washington, DC",Wynter F.

The food is excellent as well, they have daily specials and offer a variety of salads, soups, sandwiches, and quiches. If I want to torture myself I will go to the desserts case and drool over the incredibly beautiful cakes, tarts, cookies and other baked goods that are my waistline's enemy. Gorgeous.

"1705 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"I always end up here when the line at Fido is too long. I think I have finally learned to just wait in the Fido line.The chocolate croissants and eclairs at Provence are consistently good. The cakes are pretty hit-or-miss in my opinion -- I feel like the quality has gone downhill in the last several years. The food and coffee drinks are ""eh"" at best. Today I had their French toast with apples, powdered sugar, and (supposedly) crème fraîche. It was . . . edible. 7.5 bucks for two pieces of bread should be a little better than edible. There was barely any egg coating on the bread (it was still just dry in the middle) and there was no cinnamon I could taste. There was a very faint drizzle of something on top that was  maybe regular old cream but it was not crème fraîche. Their syrup isn't maple syrup, it's pancake syrup out of a foodservice jug. Which would be fine if they were charging less. Anyway, the French toast I make at home is way better even without invisible ""crème fraîche.""I also got a decaf cappuccino . . . yeah, I know, decaf, but I already had a cup of coffee this morning and too much will get me jittery. Most places I can tell the taste difference with a decaf but it's still fine. This one was not good. Somehow it managed to be both bitter and weak-tasting at the same time. It tasted like diluted decaf that has been sitting on a warmer all day. Usually I don't need sugar in a cappuccino, but two sugars did not help it at all so I brought it back up and asked to get a fruit tea to go instead. They were really nice and gave me no problems about replacing it, but the fruit tea was AWFUL! Heavier on the juice than tea, which is OK even if it's not my preference . . . but it was also way too sweet with a LOT of added sugar. I drank about an inch of it and had to toss the rest.I will be back for a chocolate croissant fix, but I think I am done giving them chances on food and coffee.",Provence Breads & Cafe,6153860363,21 reviews,2014-04-25,"Nashville, TN",/biz/provence-breads-and-cafe-nashville-3,2.0,135,"Washington, DC",chocovore s.

I'm not an overly picky customer, but I felt like returning the baguette right away: it was simply stale. It felt like a stone, like a stick of wood. There had been a snowstorm the day before and they might had their supplies of ingredients interrupted and this could have prevented them from baking fresh baguettes.. However, this doesn't justify selling  what I assume is 2 day old bread for full price. I'd be OK with that if I was warned: hey, these are stale, do you still want one?

"1705 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"I have been to Provence 5-6 times, generally to pop in for an iced coffee on my way to work. I'm usually there right around the time it opens, and get my coffee quickly. It's a solid iced coffee. Not the best I've ever had, but certainly better than Starbucks. In the past few weeks, I've been twice for food and coffee. A friend and I stopped by around 9:30am to grab coffee and a ""quick"" breakfast before a Vanderbilt football game. Initially we planned to go to Fido, but the line was literally out the door, and Provence only had 2 people in line. Seemed like a good idea at the time... my friend ordered a latte, I ordered regular coffee, and we each got a croissant sandwich. We waited about 25 minutes for the latte and the sandwiches. I'm not impatient and would normally be okay with the wait, but when my friend then requested to have her latte in a to-go cup rather than a mug, the barista VERY rudely said, ""Sure, because I don't have a million other things to do."" It took him MAYBE ten seconds to pour the latte in a to-go cup. If he had simply pointed out where the to-go cups were, she could have easily done it herself. I understand that they were busy, but it's unacceptable to be so rude to a customer. Also we saw people who were at the end of Fido's line walk by with coffees in hand about 10 minutes after we walked by, so it seems like Fido may be more equipped to handle that kind of crowd.The guy who made our sandwiches was incredibly kind and apologized for the wait. The sandwiches were delicious, and I've been back once more and gotten the frittata, which was also good. So three stars for having good food, organic coffee options, and a nice kid making sandwiches. I'm knocking stars for the rude barista and high prices.

Maybe I wasn't blown away by that meal?I didn't have a meal on this visit; I was drawn in to the store front by the ad in the window for the Sherlock Holmes latté - an Irish Cream, caramel flavored espresso drink.  I wasn't disappointed, it was wonderful.  I actually enjoyed it better than some of my most recent, stranger coffee ventures (like the ginger latté at dose and the molasses coconut milk specialty drink at Crema - I think I need to stay away from that gingery-spicy flavor family, it's not my favorite).  To accompany my latté, I had an incredible, beautiful little pistachio macaroon.  Not the coconut cluster macaroon I'm accustomed to - this macaroon is the French pastry sandwich kind.  It was unreal, and beautifully green-colored.  Other flavors of macaroons were dyed complimenting colors.  Really, I'm so excited about rediscovering this restaurant and bakery.  Very much looking forward to another visit, and a more extensive food sampling.",Provence Breads & Cafe,6153860363,295 reviews,2012-03-15,"Nashville, TN",/biz/provence-breads-and-cafe-nashville-3,4.0,135,"Washington, DC",Rachel S.

We ordered coffee, a selection of macaroons, french toast and the frittata. * The macaroons were not as light and airy as they should have been and they were the wrong size, but the flavor was okay. * The coffee was so-so. Pretty much on par with Starbucks (anyone who knows me knows I appreciate a nice roast and bean, which Starbucks does NOT have). * The french toast was two thick slices of bread with a little sauce drizzled on one of them and CANNED strawberries (IN JULY! wtf?!) with a bit of powdered sugar. * The frittata was extremely bland and topped with a jumble of greens. Not attractive in the slightest. We genuinely enjoy brunch but none of us could consume more than a few bites of the dishes we ordered. EXTREMELY. Disappointed. In all, we spent $40.

"1705 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"Nashville's local golden egg, Provence Cafe was once really a part of France until the last Ice Age (that ended in Nov 2011). One day a gentleman walked into the cafe (which used to be in Paris) and ordered a cup of coffee. That in itself was not a big deal, only that he made the faux pas of sitting in the restaurant. You see, in Paris, if you want coffee, you sit in the cafe section and if you want food, you sit in the restaurant section. It's a part of their Constitution or something. Anyway, everyone in Paris freaked out when this bizarre incident happened and ostracized Provence by carving it out of Paris and setting it loose. It floated down the Altantic, took a right turn at the Panama Canal and hitchhiked its way to Nashville, where it has since then taken root.I am sad to say that Provence is an overflow lot for Fido and Pancake Pantry. On the days when both these joints are sporting crowd until their parking lots, people throw in their sombreros and say, ""I need me some French culture,"" and head into Provence for their cheeses (get it!? culture!). The choice of bread, pastries, salads, quick bites and macaroons is infinite here. Their coffee mugs are really birdbaths for humming birds (a French thing) and their brunch options are crazy finger licking good. The relatively cramped tables and chairs and the big windows to people watch through give the feeling that one is really in a Parisian cafe.If you are in the mood for a Jack Daniel's or a random hot air balloon float, don't.

"1705 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"Provence might possibly make the world's most perfect grilled cheese sandwich paired with the best ever homemade tomato soup.  This sandwich is made from four cheeses melted into one deliciously gooey center that somehow manages to stay attached to the sandwich despite it's best efforts to escape.  The bread is a lovely house-baked sourdough that pairs perfectly with the melted cheeses.  After being pressed in the grill, the sandwich becomes crisp on the edges while still maintaining enough softness to make every bite perfect.  The soup is a harmonious balance of creamy and tomato-y, and is thick enough to coat the sandwich without running down your fingers when you dip it.  Clearly not a low fat meal, but it is worth every  bite.  My husband and I happened upon this casual Paris-inspired café by chance, and I'm so glad we did because it has become one of our favourite lunch spots in Nashville.  I haven't actually managed to try any of their other lunch offerings because I never want to give up an opportunity to have their grilled cheese, but I have yet to be disappointed by any of the wonderful cakes, cookies, and pastries they also have on offer.",Provence Breads & Cafe,6153860363,56 reviews,2013-05-25,"Chicago, IL",/biz/provence-breads-and-cafe-nashville-3,5.0,135,"Washington, DC",Leigh J.

"1705 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"Provence provides quite the conundrum. On one hand there is a sort of charm that surrounds this French inspired cafe, but on the other hand it's badly in need of a cleaning. The staff is very nice (all men who I assume are also either college students or singers) but they're NID - not into details. Okay so maybe I'm a bit of a Mom, but honestly they need to sweep this store out and wipe down a few tables. Seeing table after table not being wiped down is a huge pet peeve because no one wants to sit at a dirty table with crumbs on it. And even after seeing me wipe down my own table with a napkin they still didn't wipe down other tables. Oh man! Onto the food, I got a fromage salad which consisted of field greens, strawberries, cheese and a light dressing. The salad was okay but I was unimpressed by the amount of ""fromage"" and strawberries. I really like a hearty salad that is more than just greens and eats like a meal. Maybe this was not what they had planned and secretly discussed that I needed to lose a few pounds? I am not sure. I also ordered the Iced Honey Bee, a honey cinnamon vanilla latte upon the suggestion of Amanda S. It's basically a sweetened milk drink and has a lot of calories, so beware that your ass will get fat off of these suckers. It was a-okay but I think I'd rather have a good old caffeine laced iced coffee or a few espresso shots. I spent about $14 on my lunch and the man at the counter was nice enough to throw in a roll. I unfortunately did not have the time to try their plethora of desserts and baked goods but perhaps on my next trip to Nashville. They were very beautiful when I peered at them through the glass. Although Provence does need a thorough cleaning, it does offer free wi-fi and it was not crowded during my lunch visit. It's locally owned and you can tell they are passionate about baking. But dearest Provence, if you want to have more customers and have them return over and over again, it would be good if you would be more passionate about cleaning. No more crumbs on my table next time, okay?Yelp 365 Challenge: #206/365 (The Honey Bee)",Provence Breads & Cafe,6153860363,1267 reviews,2012-04-11,"Honolulu, HI",/biz/provence-breads-and-cafe-nashville-3,3.0,135,"Washington, DC",Emi H.

"1705 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"I'm not going to beat around the bush on this one: I love Provence.

Although many people likely come here for coffee and baked goods, I must say that their savory fare really hits the spot. Their sandwiches are always really interesting and yummy, and I love their ""anti pasti"" selections like the spreads and salads.I admit that it seems like it's pretty much nigh impossible to get good bread anywhere in Nashville, and while Provence doesn't really give me the crunch and the crust that I'm looking for, they do a better job than most other places. They used to do 1/2 off on their breads after 5 pm, something I think they stopped doing, but they do still do buy 1 get 1 free on pastries later in the day, which is always a decadent delight. The raspberry bear claw and the pumpkin muffin I snagged last week were so good, I didn't bother feeling guilty about eating both of them in one fell swoop. All in all, Provence manages to be an upscale bakery that also delivers a cozy, relaxed French vibe with tasty morsels.

"1705 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"So, I've had a lot of Provence catering before but clearly none of it was impressive enough to merit an intentional visit, since I visited it for the first time of living in Nashville for five years only last month.  I figured I should at least give the restaurant a chance, though.  Unfortunately, looking at the prices on the menu, I could barely convince myself that the soup & croissant deal was worth it.  The croissant was pretty good, but my friend got the bread instead and it was stale. For a place that has ""breads"" in the name of it, we were both disappointed in the quality of the bread.  Pet peeve #1: Establishments that can't even get what they are famous for or parts of their company name right.It was also way over-crowded for lunch which resulted in a group of three of us squishing at a table designed to comfortably seat one person.  I'm sure on an off-peak hour, this might be a nice place to grab coffee and/or a pastry or dessert.  Some of those definitely looked a bit tempting in the window.But, what really bugged me this time I visited was the cashier.  Say my order cost $7.54 and I handed her a 10 dollar bill.  But, I didn't really want  46 cents in change, so I qualified my statement by saying, ""Hold on, I have four pennies"" and proceeded to try to hand her my 4 cents so that I could prevent getting back 46 cents and instead 2 quarters (totaling 50 cents). I do this often, and I've never had trouble with this before. But, apparently this was too confusing for her, because she said ""Oh, no, I already keyed it into the register."" and then tried to reassure me, ""Don't worry, you'll get your change back."" (pause) The level of mathematical ability in the United States never ceases to surprisingly disappoint me.  I know I shouldn't judge the entire restaurant on this one case of mathematical incompetence, but as an aspiring math teacher, it really does bother me when people struggle with everyday math!  Especially someone for whom everyday basic arithmetic should be a part of the job description!",Provence Breads & Cafe,6153860363,310 reviews,2011-02-14,"San Francisco, CA",/biz/provence-breads-and-cafe-nashville-3,3.0,135,"Washington, DC",Jess Y.

I am someone who can take a loaf of crusty bread and some cheese make a meal out of it. I think opinions about this place will all be in how or what you order. The other thing to bear in mind is that you can buy their bread in the local Kroegers as well as most of the health food stores. I personally LOVE the Tuscan.

He handed us a holiday menu just in case we liked the place enough to want them to cater our holiday event, had we had one to cater. I'll give them props for good service and for jumping on the Holiday in the Village event to make some sales, and I suppose the only downfall was the new girl not knowing what a breve is.

"231 7th Ave NNashville, TN 37203",4.5,"(Review originally written on 1/12/2013, and posted on the business that was at this address before Cafe Fuzion.)If this place was good, it is not that great anymore. The first thing I didn't like is that all the silverware is plastic and the coffee is served in styrofoam cups. Then the food was very average: 2 eggs, bacon and sad-looking hashbrown (undercooked and tasted like bad oil) served on a paperplate.At $21 for a breakfast for 2 people, this place is too expensive for what you receive.Also, the bathroom was out of order.#sbroadtrip2013",Cafe Fuzion,6159536468,95 reviews,2013-10-23,"San Francisco, CA",/biz/cafe-fuzion-nashville,2.0,6,"Washington, DC",Benoit T.

Despite the low numbers of customers, the service was a little slow, although our large group might have had something to do with the slow service.They have AWESOME lunch specials. 2 rolls for $8, 3 rolls for $10, and Bento Boxes under $10. I got the shrimp Bento Box, which was $9. It came with shrimp, snow crab sushi, vegetable tempura, salad, fried rice, and miso soup. I liked the sushi and the miso soup the best. The shrimp didn't taste very fresh and they really skimped out on the add-ins in the fried rice. When the waitress brought it out, I thought they had messed up my order and given me plain rice because it was so plain looking.

The rolls are also done well, with a wide variety options.Their non-sushi options are very good. My wife loves the udon soups. Their tempura is extremely good. It's a light batter that has more fine crumb to it than other tempuras.  My favorite are the bento boxes. The sheer amount of food that comes for 15 dollars is crazy and it's great. The different meet options are very good, from teriyaki chicken or salmon to chicken or pork katsu (very good). They also have a sushi or sashimi option for s dollar or two more. It comes with shrimp and vege tempura, soup, salad, 3 goyoza, fried rice (my favorite I've ever had), a California roll and the main entree.

The Laura roll was memorable- it has both tempura shrimp and warm mayonnaise, PLUS warm avocado, so the whole thing is a melty, salty, chewy firework for the palate.  I also enjoyed the Lilly roll, and one other.  My son and I split the seaweed salad appetizer (really for one person), and my daughter loved the tofu steak appetizer, which has Mexican flavors, with stir fried green peppers, onion, and bean sprouts. If we lived in Nashville, this would be on my go-to list for sushi spots, and not just for the food.  Our service was excellent.  We were greeted by the owner, served by a red-lipped and lovely server whom we could tell was passionate about the restaurant and caring for her patrons.  The owner's wife spoke with us at length to make sure the kids were happy (our children are used to Vietnamese food, so we have to explain to them what they are ordering with other asian varieties.)Likelihood of returning?  9.9 out of 10",Sonobana Japanese Restaurant,6153566600,237 reviews,2015-03-19,"Memphis, TN",/biz/sonobana-japanese-restaurant-nashville,4.0,123,"Washington, DC",Robin B.

"40 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"FOOD: AwesomeSERVICE: PoopyExplanation:I have to re-evaluate this place. While I have been going here for at least 3 years constantly and enjoying all the food, the service has completely gone downhill. The last two times that I have been (within the last month) I have had horrible service. The food took forever to come out and the waitress barely serviced our table. Our food this past week came out very late and cold. They even didn't divide up the order correctly so there was a bit of guessing at who ordered what. Everyone at the table came over to apologize about the wait and the food, but no one really offered to do anything to fix it.  Eventually after a bunch of back and forth and them remaking some food- they reduced our bill significantly. While that eased the sting of the experience, it doesn't change the fact that they cannot handle the size of a regular dinner rush and service greatly suffers.It saddens me to write this because this has been my go to place for years!

"40 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"We went here last week for a quick sushi dinner. It's right off of White Bridge and we liked the convenient location although it was a little hard to find in the massive parking lot with lots of restaurants that looked so similar. It was quite busy for a Thursday night. We were seated promptly when we walked in. It took our waiter a little bit to get to us with our waters but we were fine with that. We ordered the Sonobana and spicy salmon rolls. Sonobana was great with the perfect amount of crunch. We had to remove a whole bunch of the fish eggs from the top but that's our fault for not telling them we dislike fish eggs. The salmon roll was like a California roll with salmon. It was fine but I expected it to be bigger (like the sonobana but later figured that's a speciality roll) and had to order another Sonobana to make up for the lack of food. Rolls were served promptly and in simple but decorative manner. We were in and out of there in a good 45 minutes I think. Overall, good experience. Nothing extraordinary so I can't say I am now a fan but if I need some quick, decent sushi around my house I'd sure return here! Also, for the three rolls we probably paid 30ish all together.

"40 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"Sonobana is my all-time favorite sushi place hands down. I have eaten here since they were ""Benkay,"" and have never been disappointed. It's difficult finding good Japanese food in Nashville, let alone a place that has a small Japanese grocery store attached to it. Sonobana has a pretty extensive menu, offering various types of sushi (many creative  rolls as well), a great lunch bento box deal, and many japanese foods other places don't offer. My go-to orders include the soft shell crab (their spider roll has a lot of crab too), any of the lunch bento boxes (comes with miso soup, salad with home-made delicious dressing, and your choice of  two of the following teriyaki, california roll sushi, tempura, shrimp, etc.), salmon roe sushi (not for everyone but my favorite and hard to find in Nashville), fried oysters, sashimi/chirashi, the california roll (you know it's good if it doesn' t have cucumber), snake roll (eel in general), age tofu, and the list goes on and on. There is a drink called the ""Shirley temple"" = sprite + maraschino cherry juice which is delicious. Also, the fried ice cream is SO GOOD. Again a very special touch. The green tea ice cream is also amazing, red bean if you don't like green tea. Everything is just so FRESH.It's definitely the most authentic feeling place I've found in Nashville (being born and raised here), and all their food is undeniably delicious. You get what you pay for and more. It's not ridiculously expensive, but it's in the nice-meal price range for a poor grad student. The ambiance is casual, comfortable, and nice.The interior is decorated very nicely, with comfortable booths, colorful pictures, just very clean and well-maintained (although a tad dated, I really like it). Mr. Jerry at the front is always accommodating and has a caring well-spoken personality. Although there is one server I'm not particularly fond of, everyone else are very thoughtful and provide amazing service. A few years ago one of the waitresses forgot to put in the order for a sushi roll, and insisted on paying for a ice cream out of pocket as an apology.

Appetizers: Seaweed & Squid Salads - They're the same in every Japanese restaurantYakitori (chicken) & Broiled Squid - They're so good! I recommend to try these.

The sushi menu alone is two pages long, not counting their page of customer created rolls (The Rebecca Roll is quite tasty!). I myself am a fan of the Blake Roll, which comes covered in smelt roe, and their Cherry Bomb roll, which has spicy mayo and pieces of cherry in it. My other favorite roll has to be the Valentine's roll they came up with last year. It comes with six pieces grouped into three heart-shaped pieces of sushi, wrapped up in pink soy paper. Has strawberries, salmon, cream cheese, and mango sauce, and is oh, so tasty! Not to mention very, very pretty on the plate! I know that they have Bento boxes here, which I have yet to try. And for dessert, the green tea ice cream is fantastic!You can also come in/call and get to-go orders. If you come in sometimes they'll even offer you a free drink while you wait.There is also a cute little Japanese grocery attached to the restaurant. They have everything here from Japanese candy to pints of the aforementioned green tea ice cream and frozen entrees. There is a floor to ceiling shelf of anime videos, though I've never paused to peruse the titles.Prices here are very reasonable. For two rolls I can walk out of here spending less than $15.

"40 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"Who would have thought incredible chirashi could be found in land-locked Nashville, Tennessee? The chirashi at Sonobana is so good it eats more like an expensive box of chocolate truffles than a box of raw fish. This one includes fresh cuts of maguro, sake, hamachi, white tuna, octopus, ebi, surf clam, mackerel, crab stick, and a delicious freshly-made tamago that is closer to a dessert.  I'm not crazy about surf clam or mackerel, and Sonobana has always been more than willing to oblige with whatever I have asked to substitute-usually more yellowtail (which is my favourite) but they've also been known to throw in pieces of unagi (delicious barbecued eel) despite the fact that it's not something typically included in chirashi.  I love spicy mayo, tempura crumbs, and ponzu as much as the next American sushi-goer, but the fish at Sonobana is so fresh and of such high quality that it is better with fewer embellishments so you can actually taste the subtle flavours of the fish.  Better yet, you can alternate each mouthwatering bite with a forkload of one of a lovely selection of extra goodies they pack into that little box, including sweet pickled burdock root, seaweed sunomono, strings of crunchy diakon root, pickled ginger, and wasabi.  All of this sits on top of a bed of seasoned rice sprinkled with sesame seeds, seaweed, tobiko that is a culinary triumph on it's own.  I often ignore rice to fill up on more fish, but Sonobana's is so good I find myself continuing to eat it even after the fish is long gone.   Hands down the most satisfying chirashi I have ever eaten.",Sonobana Japanese Restaurant,6153566600,56 reviews,2013-05-25,"Chicago, IL",/biz/sonobana-japanese-restaurant-nashville,5.0,123,"Washington, DC",Leigh J.

"40 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"I still eat here on a regular basis. My only gripe is that the Tuna isn't what it used to be, but I'm guessing there are factors beyond the restaurant's control behind that. Overfishing, declining stocks, toxicity, etc etc. I read another review that made me angry: ""This restaurant was better when it was BenKay"". Ok dude, I was around when it was Ben Kay and the food hasn't changed. Beside the Tuna, everything tastes as great as it used to. That water collecting at the bottom of your salad bowl? That's salad dressing, smart guy.This place is still tops in Nashville.

"40 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"Another great experience at Sonobana. As many of you probably know, Sonobana is owned by the family of Moon Sun-myung - a significant Korean industrialist who is known for the Unification Church and his many commercial endeavors including the Washington Times. They also own a sushi purveyor and that explains the quality of the fish that they serve.  Moon died in 2012.Sonobana is easily the best sushi that I've had outside of New York, San Francisco and Chicago. Their sushi menu is diverse and includes things you don't often see such as ankimo and awabe - uni is also available if you ask.

It was basically a tempura fried California roll sitting in sweet chile sauce topped with baked shrimp and spicy mayo. Definitely not healthy, but amazing!

I'll probably try it again and ask they leave the seeds out of the rice. Hamachi (yellow tail) nigiri was pretty standard. Beef gyoza was delish. My boyfriend loved the caterpillar roll.

The udon soups (try the duck!) are a nourishing dinner during bitter winter nights, made even cozier by the green tea. The fish is the freshest in the city, so I choose sashimi or nigiri when I am lucky to be in that part of town.

The outside signage is underwhelming, and upon entry, I felt like I was walking into a ""Great Wall"" or ""Golden Dragon"" type place. We were warmly greeted and our server was right over. Love that anywhere. We went overboard and ordered 3 rolls of sushi, a bento box and a chicken teriyaki. Have to say, the sushi was very good. Fresh and well made. Bento box was also tasty.

"40 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"O.K., here's the deal. We moved too far from our favorite sushi restaurant - Peter's Thai & Sushi in Brentwood - to go every weekend. (If you're drinking sake, it's a tad too risky.) So we set out to find a new place up in the Green Hills/White Bridge Road area. We tried them all and Sonobana is the best you're going to find in the area. Maybe not the best sashimi, but the best sushi rolls. Maybe not the best decor (it's a little dark and worn), but it's comfortable like you're favorite sneakers and there's a place to rest your feet under the sushi bar (plus they give you a hot moist towel when you first sit down to wipe your hands). And maybe not the friendliest sushi chefs. It's like they're either so painfully shy, so snobby or so afraid to use their English, they barely look up when you sit down.But, there's something really honest about Sonobana that keeps drawing us back. Most importantly, their fish is fresh and their rolls are very creative. The Rebecca roll - a deep fried California roll, topped with baked shrimp in spicy mayo (I know, it's fattening!) $6.95, the White Bridge roll (tuna, salmon, egg, crab, mint leaf rolled in radish) $4.75, the Daisy roll (salmon, albacore, smelt roe, avocado, asparagus, sweet chili sauce and flying fish roe) $6.50, and the Hiroshi roll (radish, lettuce, burdock, ginger, cucumber, avocado, red cabbage, asparagus, a little cream cheese, rolled in radish) $4.25. I've tried their sashimi, but for me, the pieces of fish, while extremely fresh, were a little too thick and too big to eat in one bite. My Other Half ordered the Tuna Tataki, his favorite at Peter's. He said Sonobana's is not as good as Peter's.Maybe over time, we'll get that ""Welcome back"" greeting from the chefs. Until then, we're totally happy that we've found a new favorite. The fish is fresh. The prices are totally reasonable and the service is very good.

"40 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"The food?  Awesome.  The service?  Awful.  The sushi is always amazing and the rolls are all unique.  My personal favorite is the cherry bomb roll.  However, the service leaves a lot to be desired.  The last time I ate in, I stood up front for 10 minutes before somebody even saw me and came to seat me.  The last few times I've ordered take-out, it's the same thing.  I stand up at the counter for a very long time before somebody even comes by to help me, and this is after many employees have looked right at me and continued doing what they were doing instead of helping me.  I understand that restaurants get busy, but a 10 minute wait just to be acknowledged is a bit much.  They need more staff desperately.  However the sushi is so delicious that I always forget about the iffy service and remind myself it's all worth it.  Tip: Call in your take-out order way before you need it.  They run behind often and this saves you the frustration of waiting around for them to finish making your order.  Especially on weekend nights make sure you get your take=out order in early because they will stop taking them if they get a lot.  This is my favorite sushi restaurant in Nashville and I highly recommend it, just be sure to have patience when you do go.",Sonobana Japanese Restaurant,6153566600,6 reviews,2014-05-20,"Arvada, CO",/biz/sonobana-japanese-restaurant-nashville,4.0,123,"Washington, DC",Sarah D.
"40 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"This place was a disappointment on all levels.  I know Tennessee is land locked so expecting great sushi is a tall order, but I'm from Minnesota and you can still find a decent roll.  The restaurant is located in a strip mall and is decorated and feels like a strip mall restaurant.  The menu is cheap plastic with terrible photos of the food.  The prices are also cheap, and you definitely get what you pay for.  We went on Sunday night at 7pm, and it was very busy.  The service was slow.  We ordered drinks right away, but then had to wait 10 minutes for the server to come back to take our food order.  We shared a couple rolls and some edamame.  It took over an hour to get our food!  The server never stopped back to refill our drinks or tell us what was taking so long.  I finally got up to go ask and was told they had a private party in the back who was ordering over $500 worth of sushi so our order was prioritized after theirs.  I guess I get that, but I sure didn't like being told my business wasn't important to them just because I wasn't spending as much money as another table.To add insult to injury, when our food finally did arrive they only gave us three of the rolls we ordered (we didn't dare send the other one back for the correct roll because we'd probably still be waiting and we were so hungry we just wanted to eat something).  The rolls were poorly made, the pieces were too big and weren't well packed.  They fell apart when you picked them up and before you could get them to your mouth.  The taste was flavorless.  Really upsetting after waiting so long for our food.We got a couple half hearted apologies and a free glass of wine we didn't want since we were driving and had already had a couple drinks.  I was absolutely shocked to see they charged me full price for the entire meal, including the part of our order that was wrong.  I tried to intimate to the server that we were not pleased with our experience, but got a too bad, we were busy kind of attitude.  Moral of the story: if you want sushi in Nashville, go somewhere else!",Sonobana Japanese Restaurant,6153566600,190 reviews,2010-05-11,"Hopkins, MN",/biz/sonobana-japanese-restaurant-nashville,1.0,123,"Washington, DC",Micki C.

I wanted to spend a little time gazing at its ""scrumptiousness"" before I scarfed it down. I ate my scallop roll first, which too was a treat. Ok, so the Rebecca roll has to be the tastiest concotion I've had in quite some time. I won't even attempt to describe how happy my mouth was to feast on it.

"40 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"This little nugget of a sushi restaurant is hiding in the Steinmart shopping plaza like it ain't no thang.  Well, it's definitely something!And by something, I mean authentic and delicious.  Boyfriend hates when the menus have pictures, but what he doesn't realize is that is how you know it's authentic!  So needless to say, I was thrilled to see the awful pictures next to each food item listed on their fairly extensive menu.Another way to know a sushi restaurant is great is when they have a lot of very simplistic sushi.  That is, no more than 3-5 items in each roll.  Again, Sonobana is right on the money.The fish was FRESH, the rolls were perfectly done and tightly rolled, and the ingredients had real flavor!  The spicy tuna was spicy!  The cajun shrimp was perfectly fried (no tempura, I'm talking true cajun style shrimp here).  Everything was delicious.Another thing I noticed was that despite the quiet, fairly slow service, the guy who sat us was fantastic.  I'm not sure if he was the owner or the host, or what, but he was just straight up cool.  He refilled our water and came back to chat about New Orleans (he grew up there, we lived there for a year).  Another bonus to this already fantastic restaurant.As if all of this experience wasn't already one of the best in my Nashville sushi adventures, we got the bill.  For four sushi rolls and a huge bottle of Nigori, we only spent $35.  What a great deal.Inexpensive, authentic, FRESH sushi?

"40 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"Sonobana seems to be one of the few sushi places in Nashville that also serves non-sushi Japanese food (Ichiban does as well, and the now long-closed Shintomi did). Yakitori, tsukemono, tonkatsu, agedashi tofu, chazuke, umeshiso roll, even natto if you like stinky/sticky things! They have a big selection of fancy western-style sushi rolls, too. Their fish has always been fresh. The service is also generally very friendly, we've had the same server maybe three times over the last six months or so and she remembered us on each subsequent visit. She has also been super attentive to our son -- having his sushi roll cut into smaller pieces, putting extra tofu in his miso soup, etc.Two negatives: A couple visits ago I had their kitsune udon and the broth was pretty meh. The second gripe is that a couple of times we have been there we were seated in the back room which is kind of dingy and harshly fluorescent-lit. Much less pleasant atmosphere than the front. It's one thing if they are full in the front, but tonight we were there early and  it was at least 75% empty up there, and it kind of felt like we were shuffled to the back because we had our 5-year-old with us (though as we were finishing our meal a man dining by himself was seated back there). When we entered the server who sat us seemed like he was going to put us in the front room but the man I believe is the owner told him to seat us in the back. The server was actually apologetic when he sat us back there. I guess we could have asked for a different table . . . again, the servers have always been really nice so I don't think they are anti-kid or anything, maybe they just avoid putting romantic date-night couples in the dingier back room.Don't miss their tiny market next door for Japanese candy, handmade mochi, and even cuts of sushi-grade fish you can take home to roll your own!",Sonobana Japanese Restaurant,6153566600,21 reviews,2013-02-22,"Nashville, TN",/biz/sonobana-japanese-restaurant-nashville,4.0,123,"Washington, DC",chocovore s.

"40 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"I love this place. I truly do. It is not the BEST sushi I have had in my life, that is reserved for a few places on the Coast back home but, in Nashville this is the place for me. My man and I have been going here for two years on a pretty regular basis. So much so, that we often spend about 30 minutes just talking to Jerry the very accomodating, soft spoken, Manager of the place. I love the service staff, they are equally friendly and accomodating- the only time it gets slow, is if they are super busy and the sushi Chefs get overloaded. I have heard a few people complain about their sushi taking too long, but they were also over the top, ordered 10 rolls at once, and everyone hears my conversation types too - so I take things like that complaint with a grain of salt. I have never been disappointed. I love the creative and traditional rolls, I love the rolls they have named and created for Customers. They often have Bento specials, which drives down the price of their already inexpensive menu. When I was pregnant with our Son, we frequented here so I could get my fix of ginger and house salad with dressing, Miso Soup and rice! I often ordered take out on nights I was too tired and huge to sit and eat! The place could use a decor update, but then again, if that happened it is likely we would see an increase in the menu prices- no thanks. Keep the chairs and booths 70""s, Jerry visiting the patrons and the sushi rolls inexpensive.

"40 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"I give up.  Good Japanese food and Nashville just don't seem to go together in the same sentence.  Had a truly depressing meal as Sonobana.  Incredibly slow service, mediocre food, and a feeling that they just didn't give much of a damn.  It was without a doubt the most disappointing dining experience I have had in recent memory.  The sushi was poor, the pork cutlet came out cold and a mess, and every table around us seemed to either have something wrong with their food, or they had to wait 20-30 minutes between interactions with the servers.  I don't think that anyone in our area had a good experience.  Maybe it was just an off night, but at $20-30 per person I will not be back to give them another chance.  What drives me crazy is that the market is great and they have some really good products.  They just don't seem to use the good stuff when preparing the meal.  Sigh.",Sonobana Japanese Restaurant,6153566600,214 reviews,2011-02-22,"Nashville, TN",/biz/sonobana-japanese-restaurant-nashville,2.0,123,"Washington, DC",Ian R.

I was just in the mood for some sushi, and she suggested this place. I thought the place itself was pretty cool, plenty of rolls, kind of interesting, and a few different sashimi options.We ordered a mixture of rolls and sashimi to split. The sashimi, was not very good, and was certainly not extraordinarily fresh. It was a Monday night, maybe they just get deliveries on Tuesday...The rolls were well prepared, and definitely worth the money charged for them. The place was not very expensive, and I pretty much got what I paid for.

"40 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"Sonobana is Nashville's hidden gem.  My husband and I discovered it over a year ago.  Ever since, we turn up at their door at least twice a month with a hungry glint in our eye that only the Sonobana roll can sate.  I make a habit of checking all of those ""Best Sushi in Nashville"" lists that come out, and I am always appalled that Sonobana never makes the cut when it is, hands down, the best sushi in town.  On one visit, we were seated at a table next to a businessman who used to live in Japan.  He said that this was the best sushi he had ever had outside of Japan.  Can a compliment get any higher than that?The staff is great and always accommodating.  We always feel right at home.  They handle groups very well, and there is even a private room that you can book ahead for authentic Japanese dining.  I have never had a bad dish.  I highly recommend the grilled sable fish and the pickled bean sprouts.  The latter makes the perfect appetizer and palate cleanser throughout the meal.  Their entrees are delicious, but I'm a sushi girl, so I tend to veer in that direction.  My husband and I can put away an embarrassing amount of sushi, and, being small people, it always seems to amuse the servers.  You have to order the Sonobana roll - it's the best thing I've ever eaten.  We also have a few other favorites - I love the Emma roll - but you really can't go wrong.  Even ordering their sushi for take out leads to a delicious dinner.  I really can't say enough great things about Sonobana.  Just writing this has given me cravings.  I guess I know where I'm going for dinner tonight!",Sonobana Japanese Restaurant,6153566600,7 reviews,2012-01-11,"Nashville, TN",/biz/sonobana-japanese-restaurant-nashville,5.0,123,"Washington, DC",Jamie P.

The prices are reasonable. I did not find their original rolls to be all that inspired. One big piece of advice I would make is ask them to go light on the smelt roe. I got a Johnson roll that was pure orange. I am not used to this being so heavy. It sort of ruined the roll. Additionally, one large disappointment was the absence of onion soup. The miso soup was decent, but I am just not a fan of the stuff, so I expect to be able to get onion soup most places I go.The service was friendly. I can say that.

I keep coming back to Sonabana. I'm not sure how long it's been called Sonobana, as I had eaten here previously when it was Ben Kay. It's funny how the place has now had two catchy names that are easier remembered as other words for me (Son of Obama and Ben Gay), but whatever works in making me remember it is fine with me!Sonobana is awesome in that they have some very common rolls mixed in with some very unique rolls. The unique rolls are what makes me keep coming back because I am unable to find their combinations at any other sushi place and the sushi is always guaranteed to be good. The other night, we found our perfect combination:Crunchy Shrimp Roll (a classic)Catepillar Roll (lots of avocado)Spider Roll (fried shimp)Bagel Roll (with cream cheese)Cherry Bomb Roll (yes, with maraschino cherries)Ume Shiso Roll (pickled plum)I highly recommend giving the last two a try if you're daring.

For being so small, they had everything, and I mean EVERYTHING I bought at all the other stores, and more. Truly authentic ingredients, fresh sashimi grade fish, a zillion varieties of curry, and even the supplies like bulk disposable chopsticks and sushi mats.

"40 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"Oh, sorry to disagree with the most recent reviews. This restaurant was formerly Ben Kay, where they made their own ginger dressing, served the best hamachi kama (yellowtail collar), and were the first Japanese restaurant to open an adjunct Japanese grocery in Nashville. It used to be the only place you could find fairly fresh udon and Poke sticks without trekking to K&S, which always smelled bad and had no personnel who spoke English. (Not that that's a criticism, because it is an Asian grocery, but it makes it difficult to find anything if you can't read Japanese, Chinese, or Korean signs.) AT any rate, Ben Kay went a bit downhill, and at some point was renamed Sonobana and I assume taken over by new owners. The staff are still friendly, the shop is still there, but the food is increasingly poor. The basics - tuna, salmon - are tired. The rice is below par; maybe its Nishiki or another good brand, but it's often dried out. The menu is enormous - it would be better if they'd concentrate on half the dishes and do them twice as well. The saddest is their salad and dressing, which tastes nothing like the previous.Which brings me to my biggest beef about Japanese restaurants in Nashville. Why not spend the extra couple of cents a salad, and use something other than iceberg lettuce? Maybe drain the bowls so there's not a huge collection of water at the bottom? Oh well. There is a reason most of the reviews here date from a few years ago. This is no longer a good restaurant.

For the main course, I would definitely recommend their sushi.  All the fish is very well prepared and extremely tasty.  The Udon noodles soups are also top notch. The prices at this restaurant are really good for the quality of food you get. I would even go to say this place is a bargain.  My only complaint is that sometimes the wait is very long on weekend evenings because they do a lot of carry-out business which seems to get priority over the people actually dining in the restaurant. Next door in the Japanese grocery you can pick up spices, and seaweed salad, and all kinds of stuff in strange packages.  It's fun to look through the grocery after having a meal, to see all the ingredients that went into its preparation.

"40 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"I've been coming to eat at this restaurant since I was a kid. I don't care what the sign over the door says, this place is Benkay and it is delicious. Service is fast, polite, and friendly. The old man who runs the floor may look like a creeper, but he's nice, I promise. I always get either a bento box or a rice bowl when I'm here. Oyakodon is a personal favorite--here, it's pretty good, although I liked the one at the now-closed Shintomi better. Katsudon's not bad either. The bento boxes are great--the special box in particular, with an amazing assortment of sashimi, is a treat. They've got these INCREDIBLE chicken wings that I could eat a hundred of. The portions are enormous and amazing. Good, solid Japanese food is always such a treat. The grocery store attached to it, though, kicks my level of love for this place up quite a few notches. For years, every time the fam would come here to eat, we would pass through the grocery store on the way out to buy dessert, whether it be the authentic plum candies or Chinese mochis (much larger than the Japanese version white people are used to, filled with red bean paste or black sesame paste instead of ice cream, in my opinion vastly superior), the Swiss rolls or those long rolls of sweet biscuit things that defined my early childhood in Singapore, or the red bean/green tea ice cream that are relatively new additions.

"40 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"As a disclaimer, I only tried the Udon (soup), so I have no opinion on the sushi or tempura type dishes. I have been suffering from some sort of Udon craze lately, it's all I seem to want these days. So last night I took my little sis, and that brave little girl dove straight into the Udon with me. We both loved it! We ordered the one with fried bean curd, which was really sweet tasting. There was kale (I think that's what it was) that added a delicious flavor, perfectly doughy thick udon noodles, and the broth was sweet but too much so. The waiter was shocked that I managed to eat the entire bowl. It was a healthy, delicious treat, and only $6.75! Totally filled me up. The interior of the restaurant is simple, nothing too special, until you pass by the special room with traditional low tables and ""chairs"" which have the seat part as more of a cushion on the ground. I imagine that's for parties or special occasions, looks like it would be fun to go with a group and request that room.

"40 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"Some friends of mine go to Sonobana every christmas eve (not sure why, maybe it's the only place open?) Anyways, things got off to a bad start by them putting our reservation in the smoking section. I guess it was our fault for not specifying, but it seems weird for someone to just assume that we'd be ok with it. I hadn't been in a restauant with a smoking section for a while, and was struck by how strong the smell was, even though when we got there no one was smoking. It kinda smelled like feet. Mmmmm feet and sushi, there's a magic combo.For the most part, the food was decent, I suppose. At least all my friends seemed to like what they got. There wasn't too much vegetarian stuff on the menu, so I ended up getting something called an Erika Roll that was described on the menu as ""cucumber, avocado & crunchies"". Yes, crunchies. Apparantly, ""crunchies"" is code for deep fried pencil shavings, and lots of 'em. After taking one bite, I coughed up a fine cloud of the tasteless fried sawdust that left me gasping for water. To be fair, I partly ordered it because it sounded kind of ridiculous, and I guess it didn't dissapoint on that level.Luckily, a big part of what makes a meal is who you have it with, so the good company more than made up for the settings and food. That place has become somewhat of a tradition with my friends, and I only get to see them a couple times a year, so there's a good chance I'll end up there again next year.

"40 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"Wow, I love this place for cheap, quality sushi!  Sonobana is definitely not one of those trendy sushi places.  It's located in a strip mall off White Bridge next to Target.  I actually like the location.  It's convenient to get to, and there is plenty of free parking (always a plus--hate having to scramble for few-and-far-between parallel parking spots).  I've actually only gotten takeout from here, so I can't comment on the service but the decor (from what I could see) was your run of the mill ""homestyle sushi trying to be hip"" place.  Looks fine, but definitely not romantic.I ordered my sushi at like 6:45 on a Friday last time, and the guy answering the phone immediately told me they were really busy and that it would probably take 35-45 minutes to get me food.  I didn't mind the wait, and in fact I appreciated that before I even placed my order that he gave me that heads up and asked me if it was still ok before ordering and getting all excited about my sushi only to find out about the wait.When I arrived at the restaurant, it was PACKED.  I mean, it was a Friday night, so I guess that's a good thing, but I have never seen one of these ""homestyle"" sushi places so packed.  I go to Ginza all the time at peak dinner time on weekends, and it is never more than 60% full.  Wow.  There were tons of people getting takeout and tons of people waiting to sit down, too.  It seemed like a very family-style, neighborhood hangout.  Lots of families, and I saw the customers that were waiting making small talk with each other (one mom was asking a college-aged boy about his Montgomery Bell t-shirt, etc.).  It was kinda cute.  Gave the whole place a nice, friendly vibe.I got a shrimp tempura, Johnson roll (salmon, tuna, cucumber, and avocado and roe on the outside), and a spicy salmon roll.  I planned to split the 3 rolls between my dinner and lunch for the next day.  The Johnson roll was just delicious and was a great price ($5.50) for what would probably have been at least $8.50 at Ginza or somewhere else.  The shrimp tempura was tasty also.  I wasn't impressed by the spicy salmon roll though.  It was fairly priced, but the fish tasted very....mushed up?  Like they had made some spicy salmon puree. Not impressed.  Anyway, I think Sonobana is a great deal, and would definitely go back there again and again for a laidback evening or takeout.  Definitely not a romantic date, though!",Sonobana Japanese Restaurant,6153566600,7 reviews,2010-10-09,"Philadelphia, PA",/biz/sonobana-japanese-restaurant-nashville,5.0,123,"Washington, DC",Katrina Y.

"2117 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"I do not dole out single stars lightly, but in this case I would give 0 if I could. I first tried Belcourt Taps (& tapas? Didn't they used to have tapas?) last year and had a very meh experience. I waited for another visit to review since a first time bad experience could always be a fluke. My husband bought a groupon for 2 beer flights and an appetizer this month not knowing I wasn't a huge fan based on previous experience, but we thought, hey it's pretty hard to mess up beer. I guess we jinxed ourselves. The inside was pretty full when we arrived on a week night, and it looked like a band was about to go on. I'm thinking this place is best as just a music venue where you happen to have a beer rather than a destination for a meal.We opted for the patio since it was nice outside. We told our waitress up front that we were going to redeem their groupon, which she seemed super confused about and told us they didn't have a current groupon, their old one expired. Not her fault, but the staff was clearly not educated on the offer (which didn't expire for 3 more month). If you have a groupon out there, maybe tell your staff about it. We asked about the beer flights (not on the menu) and she told us that it was ""local stuff.""  We were fine with that explanation since we knew we were getting whatever their groupon deal was and couldn't be picky. However, when the ""flights"" arrived, it was one big service tray with 10 mini mason jars (those were cute, I'll give them that), each about a third full and nothing was labeled or in any order. They were also not cold. We asked her what they were and she said ""mostly local stuff, it's good"" and then walked away. Ok..... We ended up finding out through taste testing trial and error that we did not, in fact, have 2 flights (I incorrectly assumed we would each get the same 5 beers since it was supposed to be 2 flights...), just 10 random different beers. We also deduced that TWO of them were some kind of HARD CIDER.  I have no problem with cider if that's what I ordered, but I don't really find it acceptable to put it in a beer flight with no warning.  I won't even address the appetizer we got except to say that I do not recommend the nachos. The waitress informed us that if we didn't order anything else besides just redeeming the groupon there would be 20% gratuity charged. We had initially planned to order more, but the app was so bad that we decided not to. We were planning to tip all along, so the gratuity charge was no problem. The receipt listed the 10 beers, which included Sam Adams and Angry Orchard (aka, not local and not beer).  We asked if those were our beers since they weren't labeled and she said no, I just pushed 10 random buttons to get the bill printed so I could charge gratuity. Great. I am convinced we did get the angry orchard, though. There's no mistaking that for beer. The excuse for a beer flight would have been disappointing anywhere, but is especially puzzling from a place with ""taps"" in their name who is specifically advertising beer flight deals. Since this is 2 bad experiences in a row a year apart, it's not a fluke.

"2117 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, but my experience at Belcourt Taps left me little choice. My wife and I went there on a Groupon for two beer flights and an appetizer. We experienced the following issues:1) The waitress was unaware the restaurant was doing a Groupon and didn't seem sure how to do the beer flights. As a result...2) Our beer flights were 10 random beers (well, 9 beers and a cider) without any labels or information as to what they were. Rather than two sets of five beers, it seemed like they told the bartender to just pour 10 arbitrary brews and scatter them throughout the tray. If the word ""taps"" is in your restaurant's name, you should probably know your way around a keg.3) The nachos were so low-quality that if I had made them myself, I would have been disappointed with my handiwork. The queso was goopy, lukewarm and clearly store-bought and the toppings were only on one side.4) Maybe this wasn't their fault, but the band they hired to perform was quite bad. Picture Dolly Parton getting her wig plucked to the tune of a stale guitar and you've just about got it.Restaurants who offer Groupons are like attractive thirty-somethings on Tinder.

"2117 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"Decided to check out this place as a continuation of my brother and I's search for the best hamburger in Nashville. This is a really cool area near Vanderbilt (I had never been over here before) and most of the businesses are outfitted in what look like regular houses. I thought that was a pretty neat idea. There's lots of outdoor seating but we went on the nicest Saturday in February so we were forced to sit inside.The inside of the place is pretty small, only maybe 15ish tables (two are pretty large). All of the tables are painted with different things. Ours was one of the larger ones that was painted as a record, but we saw one nearby that had a painted version of Kenny Rogers' face (I thought it was funny). Service was decent too, the guy we had (didn't get his name) was super nice and checked back multiple times throughout the meal.I had the sliders, which were topped with bourbon onions, dijon mustard, and cheddar cheese on little pretzel buns. There was a little bit too much mustard for my liking, so that flavor kind of overpowered everything else and the bourbon onions should've had more... bourbon? Didn't really taste that. I had the side of truffle fries and the flavor in those was SO damn good. Very earthy and tasty, would definitely have those again in a hot second.My brother had the Macho Burger (stuffed with buffalo chicken and blue cheese) which he thought had a pretty good zing to it. My boyfriend had the Belcourt Black Eye (stuffed with bacon and blue cheese) and also had good things to say. They had regular fries and coleslaw, respectively, and thought the sides were just decent. Overall, everything was pretty top notch.This is a great place located in a really cute area. If you're going here, be prepared to walk because parking is the WORST. We had to walk probably 4-5 blocks to get there. Although, it's right by a park and it was the nicest day in a while so it seemed like everyone was out that day.

It goes a little something like this...Waited 30 minutes (no exaggeration) for 2 burgers with fries. Said burgers were -- in a word -- terrible. Ordered mine rare - ate it well done. Over seasoned, small, thrown together. I've made better meals in my Easy Bake Oven. Service: lackluster (and that's being nice).

"2117 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"Belcourt Taps is the perfect place if you're looking for a regular hangout place. The food is spot on with good burgers, tacos, salads, and a bunch of good appetizers. And the beers. Don't forget the beers. They have around 14 taps that are mostly dedicated to local brewers like Black Abby,  Czahns, Jackalope, and others. Most every night has music of some sort from the new-to-town singer to the Belmont student to the seasoned Nashville veteran every night offers something for everyone. Recently, they have started serving brunch on Saturdays and Sundays and like the regular menu the food on the Brunch menu is excellent. I had the Bacon, Egg, and Cheese sandwich with the potatoes and it was as good as anything I have had any place else in town. They cure the bacon in-house so the flavor is like nothing you will get anywhere else.

"2117 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"I was here recently with a group of work colleagues for dinner during some training in Nashville. I thought the food was pretty good for bar food (the primary offering is a selection of burgers, but they had great sides), and it's nice that they have the big patio for warm weather. Like most places in Nashville, they have live music, but I actually thought the venue was too small for the band they had. It's not a big location, and the music was pretty overwhelming. It's basically just one room (unless you go outside), so there was no place to escape the music and just talk with your party.Overall, it was a success for our party (~20 people, and they let us stand around a group of tables for food and drinks), but I likely won't be going back on return trips to Nashville.",Belcourt Taps,6159153622,115 reviews,2013-12-03,"Atlanta, GA",/biz/belcourt-taps-nashville,3.0,97,"Washington, DC",Katie R.

I have to say that the service was EXEMPLARY. Their selection of local brews was excellent. I love the fact that they seek out and promote local brews. The food was... well, it wasn't great. My burger, despite being stuffed with bacon and topped with blue cheese, was dry as a bone. Not quite vulcanized, but well on its way. The potato salad was BLAND. Even my girlfriend's fries were flavorless. Come on guys, ever hear of lightly SEASONING food as you cook or finish it? I will say this...I really did like the place itself. I liked the waiter and barkeep. I thought the place has a great atmosphere. The food needs a little work, though. Make that adjustment and the place could be a regular spot for me. I will indeed go back for another try, though. After all, everybody deserves a second shot.Fast forward to 1/9/2015... Once again, GREAT beer selection and atmosphere.

After we reluctantly complained, the chef did come out and apologized, offering to make it right. For a place with taps in their name, the beer selection was also uninspired. The service was ok.

"2117 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"Stuffed burgers, craft beers, dog-friendly patio, What else do you need? A few things I can recommend. Better parking, locally sourced food items, more loyalty from a couple of employees. I have been really surprised that the restaurants on both sides have been packed but this place isn't. From what I gather it is probably from the days of yore when they were a not so successful tapas restaurant with a very similar name.First I had the Hells Kitchen burger. First word that comes to mind is ""DAMN!"" It was just the right ratio of spicy to taste, lots of cheese and cooked perfectly. Topped off with the pretzel bun I would call it my best burger yet in Nashville.Craft beer selection was good but not great. Selections from Czann's & Brooklyn brewery on draft made me happy. Would loved to have seen some local craft taps. The patio has been my go to spot due to being with friends that have dogs. They have dog bowls that they bring out with water for the four legged friends. Parking in this area won't get any better so be prepared to walk a ways. Although the burger was pretty fantastic the sides were just ok. As you will see from any of my reviews I love fresh fries. When you are taking the extra step to do truffle, garlic parmesan, and sweet potato fries I don't see why you wouldn't take the other half step to go fresh with these items. Fresh and local is always better. I would also love to try their burgers with locally sourced grass fed beef. Finally the staff... Patio staff has been EXCELLENT. They do have a bartender there though that was antagonizing and making fun of a musician that was playing the other night. As far as I'm concerned this is disrespectful to your boss who brought them in, to them as a customer, and any fans that the performer may have brought in. All of which are responsible for your paycheck. If you disagree you should never show it in front of customers. I also heard that this gentleman is rude to customers and couldn't believe it with how well I had been treated at this establishment.To wrap this review up.

"2117 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"I did not visit this establishment during its previous owner's reign, before the name change to ""Belcourt Taps"" from ""Belcourt Taps and Tapas"". (Confusing to say the least.) From what I understand, the ""Tapas"" days were uninspiring.But I have had the pleasure of conversing with owner Chris, manager Christina, and bartender Sammy over my several visits in recent months. It seems this newish team is taking strides to make their patrons feel welcome -- a neighborhood bar-type effort.They have changed the menu to reflect their specialty of stuffed burgers, and they are quite good. Arguably, as good or better than Burger Up.Being a Jackalope lover, I am thrilled I have been able to have not one, but TWO options for beer consumption - between Rompo and Bearwalker. Most definitely warranting a ""Yipppeeee!"".On Christmas Day evening, I searched for a place to just sit down and have a brew, and Belcourt was the only place I could find in the area that was open. I had hoped for a somewhat quiet experience, which I did not receive due to a few other patrons at the bar. Nevertheless was grateful they were open.I was a bit hungry, but their kitchen wasn't staffed. However, the evening's bartender (which I later discovered is the owner), offered to rustle up some fries. Very, very kind of him, and it hit the spot.I have also learned the staff is incredibly dog friendly, and encourage their guests to bring Fido to their porch in warmer months.

I'm not a fan of the meat-inside-meat trend, mostly because the burgers come out way overcooked. I found them too dry for my taste, but the truffle fries were good.The biggest problem was with my order of shrimp tacos. When I ordered it the waiter warned me it wasn't a lot of food, but I figured for $9 it would be more than enough. What I got was two really sad tacos. They were stuffed with shrimp, canned diced tomatoes and cheese. NOTHING ELSE. No avocado, no lettuce- nothing fresh. I was so utterly disappointed.

"2117 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"In many ways, walking into Belcourt taps felt like it was going to be a awesome place, one place I could find as a bar home away from home, I suppose. However the slow service, and lack of certain menu items left me disappointed and wanting more out of a visit. I stopped in last week with a group of mutual friends to see a friends band start the evening of music off. The outside patio caught my eye and looked like a great place to relax for the evening, it was quite, spacious, and with comfortable chairs and large tables -- I like this. The inside is about the same size but is packed with a ton of tables. A few circular tables sit in the read and most tables are murals of some of country's greatest all-stars ; my table was a mural signed by Merle Haggard, by chance , which was fitting as I listened to him the entire drive to Nashville from the border of Virginia. The stage area is on the small side, but can accommodate up to four players on the stage.  On the back end of the bar, is the medium sized bar, with several taps and a liquor wall. On tap, there is many craft ales, brewed from many local breweries and a few from around the central USA, Yazoo, and Abita stood out as did their house ale. Beer prices were cheap, it was a specials night or something but every brew was $2.5.Food wise their menu offers a lot of choices and has many bar style foods and BBQ on the menu. This is were I had an issue with Belcourt, they didn't have their smoker working during my visit, making almost half of their menu not available which completely took away from the experience, in my opinion.  We started off with Chicken Nacos, which were good, though they were a little on the heavy side for a starter, this dish could've been an entree. For the entree we tried their shrimp tacos. Over-all good shrimp, which were well prepared, and paired with fresh ingredients and feta cheese ;  good just not worth the $8.5 price. Our service also hindered our experience, I found myself ordering two beers a time, because it was nearly impossible to get the attention of anyone in the staff.Belcourt is also a good music venue, there is a lot of talent in Nashville, and it is displayed well here. Sound is good and not too overly loud, and it is a relaxing venue to visit.

Well....The first sign of trouble was that we sat for 10 minutes on the patio before I was able to wrangle the bartender who informed me that she was the only person on the floor that day besides the kitchen staff. Sunday afternoon brunch/lunch is a fairly busy time for dining spots in this area, right? However, I must mention that although she was scurrying around filling bar orders and bussing tables too, she was very efficient and nice throughout our visit. She knew how to keep her cool!The patio area has a comfy and nice layout for a lazy lunch or happy hour. A quick glance at the menu also confirms very reasonably priced fare too.However, everything else was lackluster. Several of our party of 7 were advised that the items that we chose to order were not available or no longer on the menu including the Sweet Potato Tots with Chipotle Dipping Sauce ($5)... how sad. I opted for the Jalapeno Hummus with Crostini ($5) and planned to share an order of Sweet Potato fries that the waitress suggested as a substitute for the tots with a friend. The hummus was solid and satisfied my tastebuds but the fries that she brought out looked like a mutant experiment from a mad scientist! Not only did they taste odd but it appeared that they were dipped in cornmeal? I believe that she sensed that the order was not prepared correctly because as soon as she brought them out, she offered to take it off our bill.Not. A. Good.

"2117 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"Location: I love street parking..when there's no meter. I hate dumping my change purse out, but I promised to meet a friend here at 3 and the meters still tik till 5. I love the area, but damn I wish parking was better.Environment: I've seen Belcourt Taps advertised and based off their website, I'm imagining a young and fun original restaurant. When I got there, the place is very original, but I felt like I was in the backwoods of Wilson County. I live in Mount Juliet, so I like going ""into town"" (if you will) to get away. When I arrived, there was absolutely no one there, and the server was chilling with her grandchild, a couple of months old. Our drinks were served in a red solo cup (minus beer). Their performance stage is extremely small, which some could call intimate but I would call inconvenient if I were to be there at night. Maybe my timing had to do with it. Okay, so my timing had everything to do with it. Goes to show, no matter what city you're in, 3:00 on a Monday is going to be dead as a door knob (besides Fido's). The actual look of the restaurant is cute and country vintage looking.Food: I got a house salad and the Hangover. I felt the house salad, which was $6, was a bit much for just lettuce, onions, and cheese. The Hangover was so excellent! I really did enjoy the bourbon onions on the salad and was happy they were on the burger. I've had a food truck's stuffed burger once and it was so sloppy that the cheese came out like juice. Belcourt Tap's was perfect, enough flavor and no messiness. Granted, it's a HUGE burger, it is kind of messy, just not the same. The pretzel bun is amazing and made it easy for me to eat in 4's (hope that makes sense). Fries were awesome too! I felt like the $12 for the Hangover was worth it.Service: Despite having to take care of her grandson while working, our server was awesome. She was always on point with things and never missed anything. Overall the food was great, and if I came back, it would definitely be for the food, but probably not for anything else. Well, besides the service :)",Belcourt Taps,6159153622,20 reviews,2013-06-04,"Mt Juliet, TN",/biz/belcourt-taps-nashville,4.0,97,"Washington, DC",Jessica T.
"2117 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"Originally heading to Zumi Sushi for my first Zumi experience, it was discovered the rest of my group (a.k.a. parents) were not a fishy mood.  So, we decided to head on in to Tap & Tapas.  The patio looked nice, but it was a bit chilly that day, so we went inside.  I wasn't expecting a bar atmosphere, but my parents said it was fine, so we took a seat.  We were the only table there and sat right next to the pretty loud speaker, but again, my parents said it was fine (are we switching roles??), so we didn't move. The bartender/waitress was the only one there and she was very friendly, helpful, and personable.  She talked about her son and showed us cute pictures :)  We ordered the chicken rollups (not sure of the actual name) off the tapas section and asked for the horseradish on the side.  She said it was premixed in, although the menu said it was drizzled on top....so, she said she would take care of it. When they came, there was a sauce on the side, which tasted more like a Caesar dressing and the rolls themselves were a bit spicy, but good, and not horseradishy.  My mom had the burger with mushrooms, which she said she'd give 3.5 stars.  It was a bit underdone than what she'd ordered,  the bun too soggy, and very sweet with the mushrooms (& their sauce?) and the brie.My dad ordered the cajun crab burger, which he really liked (4-5 stars), but would have preferred it to be thicker, as it was practically a discus.I ordered the lone burger, which was a tiny little stone of meat, but turned out to be satisfying.  I don't mind a bun that's been soggied from its juices, so this was fine for me, but I could see others not being happy with it.  I also upgraded to the parm-garlic fries and was so glad I did - taaasty!Overall, it's a good place to go for a simple & quick lunch if in the neighborhood and not wanting to do the Jackson's thing.",Belcourt Taps,6159153622,55 reviews,2012-04-14,"Nashville, TN",/biz/belcourt-taps-nashville,3.0,97,"Washington, DC",Emily E.

"2117 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"I guess I should have been more thorough in my research, but I had much higher expectations.  Belcourt is really just a college hangout that's jammed among several others of a different variety.  It's in an old neighborhood where the small houses have been converted into businesses, mainly restaurants.  Cars are parked on either side of the street with just enough room between them for two cars to pass.  The best parking option is the lot at the end of the street that you'll have to renew every hour ($3, not that you'd want to stay longer than an hour).I had made reservations because it was available on the site, but that must be for when someone special is playing, because it's really just a bar with some flair.  There were three girls singing.  I don't know all of their names, but Megan Bundy (meganjbundy on twitter) had someone passing out her card.  They were all three very good singers with mainly original material. I don't know if they usually work together (I don't think so), or if singers just sign up and show up, but that was the Taps' saving grace for our evening.We got the Chef's Cheese Plate to share.  Thank goodness we did, because it was the best thing on the table.  It's hard to mess up cheese and bread.  My daughter got the curried chicken sandwich with ""house chips.""  Very (very, very) bland sandwich and the chips were overcooked, but not quite burnt.  I got the Fruited Quinoa.  I'm a big fan of quinoa, but I got half way through and was tired of eating it.  Too sweet and boring.  Maybe some pine nuts or barley would be a nice addition.They do have some other things on the menu that look good, like the White Cheddar Grit Cake with Andouille Gravy, Fried Soft Shell Crab BLT, and the Portobello Sandwich, but even if it were outstanding, I wouldn't want to go through the parking fiasco and the crowd to get in there.Overall, unless you're a college student that just wants to go hang out at a bar with your friends (they have a front porch that's so close to the houses next door and the sidewalk that you can high-five any passerbys and neighbors) and see who's out for the night, you might want to try somewhere else.",Belcourt Taps,6159153622,61 reviews,2011-06-18,"Norcross, GA",/biz/belcourt-taps-nashville,2.0,97,"Washington, DC",Kris D.

My selection, the Juicy Lucy, was very satisfying both in terms of portion and flavor. I imagine any burger there would be equally pleasing.That said, the staff left a very sour taste in my mouth. Though I requested a menu at the bar, the bartender refused to offer me one until I ordered a drink. It might be worth mentioning that my girlfriend knew what she wanted, and though they didn't have it, she was given something of a somewhat similar variety. A few minutes later, I asked for a drink with gin, which I found they did not have. My bad, considering the decent selection of beers. After thinking through other favorite drinks of mine, I realized this bar was missing several staple drinks and had to settle on whiskey and ginger ale and a rum'n'coke. As some of the other reviews mention, food took a while to come out despite the small crowd and even smaller group of people ordering food. The food makes me want to say that it was worth the money, but the wait staff and poor drink selection (excluding beers) makes me wonder if it was worth the time.",Belcourt Taps,6159153622,5 reviews,2012-08-13,"Tallahassee, FL",/biz/belcourt-taps-nashville,3.0,97,"Washington, DC",Matt C.

"2117 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"This is a restaurant/bar/music venue that is quickly getting better in my eyes. My first few visits here were hit-and-miss from a service perspective. They could be oddly understaffed for what is usually a high-volume time of day (weekday happy hours and Fridays around 9). I kept coming back for the live music, and the experience improved.The food has always been great for the price, and the rotating beer selection has been enjoyable. I love their new stuffed burger selection. Stuffed burgers can be easily fouled up, but Belcourt Taps has consistently delivered a burger that has been cooked perfectly. I also love the the fact that they always seem to have new beers to try. The only downside to the tap rotation is that some of my favorites are only there a short time. If they could just get that Vanilla Porter back, I might never go to another watering hole again.Above all, this is a good listening room to catch a variety of songwriters and small groups. They seem to have a good eye for talent while also giving up-and-coming musicians a fair chance. I have seen major country songwriters and stars stop by for an impromptu set, and I have also seen some enjoyable singer/songwriters that I would never have otherwise heard of.From a musician's perspective, they are also very friendly to the musicians who play here.

First off, the name is misleading.  They have a serious lack of taps and interesting beer, and the tapas are more like suped-up appetizers and glorified bar food.  I asked for the ""Taps Room Brew,"" or whatever they nicknamed their yellow piss-water.  I thought it might be unique so I asked the server who brewed it.  She didn't know and had to ask, and I was disappointed when she told me it was Anheuser-Busch.  I was basically drinking Bud Light.  We ordered the burger which was pretty good, the truffle oil macaroni-n-cheese, and some fried artichoke hearts which were very bland.  The rest of the menu was quite limited and included mainly fried, southern, finger foods.We also made the mistake of going on a singer-songwriter night.  Needless to say, it was hard to have conversation while Joe Country was singing about how he loves to eat deli sandwiches after sex (true story).This place seems like nothing more than some music biz executive's personal snack bar and watering hole.  For some reason it had a very music row vibe (much like the places on or around Demonbreun) and lacked any pizazz.  So if you're into the same 'ol boring, stereotypical, mediocre, Nashville food experience, then go to Taps and Tapas on Belcourt.",Belcourt Taps,6159153622,2 reviews,2011-05-16,"Nashville, TN",/biz/belcourt-taps-nashville,2.0,97,"Washington, DC",Joey D.

I'd love to see a more thoughtful beer selection for a place with Taps in the name. Currently they offer what I'd expect from a normal local restaurant, normal is not good here. I think they need to carry more unique craft beers to stand out amongst their neighbors such as Jackson's. This is Nashville, most places carry Yazoo, lets see some Dales, Avery, Great Divide, etc. There are lots of Tapas to choose from but I'd like to see less choices and better choices. Humus, stuffed mushrooms and prosciutto are not very original. I did however enjoy the sweet potato tots with honey. Basically I feel they could strive to be more unique and are not currently living up to their potential. For not being a chain, they seem to be playing it too safe.

I've had a 50% off deal through ScoutMob and figured I should take advantage of this great deal. My friend had just arrived in Nashville, and after a stop in German town for some lunch, we wanted to go somewhere and grab a beer. I was thinking Hillsboro Village would be a cool spot to hit up.

They do an open mic session on Thursdays from 11AM till 6PM. Needless to say this was a awesome Thursday find. All of the musicians were great. We just kept hoping that were not going to ask either of us to get on stage a play.

"2117 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"For those who need a short review- do not bother with this restaurant.For those others that want the drama that unfolded this evening- please keep reading. I purchased a Groupon for this restaurant today with the plan that we would visit this evening before the weekend started. I have been a server before and know that taking care of tables with coupons can be a hassle. However, having said that, I know how to take care of my server monetarily regardless of what the ticket looks like. After we sat down, it took quite a while for our waitress to come back and take our order.We ordered an appetizer in addition to the two entrees and beer flight that our Groupon included. While the bartender is pouring our beers, he is loudly bitching to our waitress and another client about ""coupon people"". The conversation continues for close to 5 minutes about us only 5 feet away! Then our entrees arrive before our appetizer because according to the waitress, she forgot. In order to be fair, our burgers were ok. However, our ""specialty fries"" were a let down. My ""stadium"" cheese fries had cheese from a jar poured on them and my husband's parmesan fries had the commercial, green container parmesan sprinkled on them. The appetizer, when it arrived, was another poor representation of this restaurant. Then, to top it off, the beer was... ""off"". I am a huge fan of our local brewery, Yazoo. However, when we tasted that in addition to some other unknown brews, I couldn't finish my Dos Perros. My guess is that they haven't cleaned their taps or their lines in a long time, therefore, giving the beer an undesirable flavor/finish. By the time our meal ended, I was furious and in the process of leaving a scathing note for the bartender, however, my husband dissuaded me saying ""Don't even bother... this place won't be open in two months"". Hopefully, I have given you a clear picture of your potential meal. -Natasha",Belcourt Taps,6159153622,1 review,2013-02-07,"Nashville, TN",/biz/belcourt-taps-nashville,1.0,97,"Washington, DC",Natasha C.

"2117 Belcourt AveNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"I've been here a few times to catch a show, and I have to say that this place is not worth the time or the effort just to park.What a very odd concept for a great location.  Taps and Tapas - without tapas, and with just a handful of local beers on tap. With just a few overpriced ""tapas"" (nothing spanish here!) and then the ""shared plates"" (starting at $10), one person cannot get a full meal for less than $20. IMHO, I believe that a restaurant can get away with a limited menu and high prices if: 1. the quality is superb, 2. the portions are generous, or 3. the food is inventive.  I have found T&T to be none of these things.  I do not think there is anything creative or inventive about fried green tomatoes or a caprese salad. Mac and Cheese for $10? I think I'll go to J. Alexanders for that dish - it is far better and less expensive.  And the prices for a chacuterie/ anti-pasta assortment are astronomically high. A quick warning: the menu was a little different each time I went, so don't get your heart set on any of the dishes from the website.I hesitated between giving this place one star or two, but went with one simply because of the service. Do not expect to be served outside. After finally having a server come over to ask me if I would like a beverage, and requesting the wine list, he brought the list and never returned. He did not return once during the entire three hours I was there watching the performance!  After a half an hour of waiting, I finally went up to the bar and ordered my glass of wine.  It is a good thing that I didn't have a friend with me or was not looking for a seat.  The management staff had spread out their computer and paperwork over half of the bar and remained seated there the entire evening. That evening was not my first experience with the management taking up the seats at the bar, and I am certainly confused as to their motivation and/or lack of concern for customers!  I wonder if the architect just forgot to put in an office for the staff?  Most importantly, when your servers are scared of the management, it makes for a very tense environment.  My first trip to the restaurant was just after the entire wait staff, bar staff and kitchen staff had all walked out. In my later visits, the servers seemed resentful and contemptuous.  I've been in the industry before, and it is always easy to tell when servers are enjoying their work and having fun, or are scared, or are bored, or are frustrated.  These servers seem scared.Uninventive, bland, boring.  Expensive.  Poor service and poor attitudes.

"3001 W End AveNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"Maybe I'm used to my hole in the wall Greek food, but I thought Taziki's was nothing special after my trip this weekend.I stopped in with my BF and it was pretty empty on a Saturday afternoon, but has a very nice atmosphere. The restaurant is clean and open with lots of space. I also noticed right away that they offer wine and beer and they have a nice outdoor seating area. We ordered the grilled lamb gyro and chicken salad with 2 waters, and it was around $18.00. Maybe I was thrown off by expecting the food and prices of my run of the mill Greek places, but I thought it was a bit steep for what we received. The chicken was bland and the lamb was not shaved in strips like most Greek places. The lamb was just OK and I liked the dill sauce but overall it was lacking. I had the tomato cucumber salad on the side that was my favorite part of the meal because it was seasoned well. I also had potato chips on the side, which I found odd. I would have ordered something else if I had known. Overall, I've had better and will go somewhere less glamorous for my Greek food because I feel that you pay for the interior rather than a good meal.",Taziki’s Mediterranean Cafe,6157242276,484 reviews,2012-10-03,"Nashville, TN",/biz/tazikis-mediterranean-cafe-nashville,2.0,58,"Washington, DC",Sheena T.

It was also cook well, nice char on the outside, while staying nice and moist on the inside. The sides were great as well. Fresh romaine lettuce, awesome kalamata olives, and great feta that was not to pungent. Also comes with great tzatziki  on the side and fresh pita bread.

On to the bad. I went in on a Tuesday night around 815 to get takeout, and they made me feel like I was interrupting clean up time. I wasn't greeted by anyone, even though there were 4 guys behind the line and a girl sweeping the dining room floor. Even as I approached the register, the girl put her broom down, went behind the line, and just looked at me. Not a hello, how are you, or what would you like. To further this point, two ladies came in after me and were told that the food they wanted would take over 10 minutes to cook. But the tone was what was telling. It was said in a way that was clear they didn't want to be bothered and should go elsewhere for food. I can get good Mediterranean food just about anywhere in town. It is the little things that will keep me coming back. Feeling as though I inconvenienced you by eating at your restaurant is a definite way to ensure I wont be back.UPDATE 1/5: The GM emailed me and asked for my phone # and then called me shortly there after.

"3001 W End AveNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"During one of my trips to Belfast to visit the in-laws, I had lamb for the first time. Since then, I've made this protein as my first choice when I try out a restaurant that offers it. I was absolutely thrilled to see lamb on the menu at Taziki. I had their grilled lamb plate, which came with a salad and a choice of either rice or potatoes. The Asian in me always chooses the rice. It also comes with a ""skordalia"" sauce -- it looks like hummus, but it's made out of bread. I sincerely hope that I didn't make the guy who took my order feel bad -- when I asked what this sauce was, he started off saying it was made from kaiser roll. I thought I misheard him; he thought his accent made him say the wrong word. He was fine -- I was simply doing a double take on a sauce made from bread. I've heard of this type of sauce before; I just didn't expect it. They gave me a sample with a crunchy pita. It was heavenly.Frankly, I expected the lamb to be chopped up. When my order came, and I saw 3 fillets (fat strips) of lamb, I was dumbstruck and pleased. Both the salad dressing and the skordalia sauce came on the side, which I appreciated. The crunchy pita seemed homemade. But it was slightly on the salty side -- but I've also noticed that in general, prepared food around Nashville tastes saltier than what I'm used to. The lamb was slightly pink in the middle (the way I like it) and was great. While I enjoyed the skordalia sauce with the pita, I think the next time I get this dish, I will ask for tzatziki, instead (or order it in addition, since I sincerely like both sauces).I also like the interior. The tables and comfortable chairs seem more expensive than the type of casual, cafe dining offered. There are also salads and gyros on the menu.",Taziki’s Mediterranean Cafe,6157242276,534 reviews,2011-11-13,"Loma Linda, CA",/biz/tazikis-mediterranean-cafe-nashville,4.0,58,"Washington, DC",Ruiqiu K.
"3001 W End AveNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"The best quality of this place is that it's absent of that huge spinning Lamb Hot Dog that is disgustingly displayed at most Greek places.  The yeerohs are actually stuffed with real lamb.  They execute their dishes very well and the brand new restaurant has a great environment to sit in.  The prices are expected.  However, I'd think a better business approach would be to offer a larger portion on the sides to make ppl feel like they're getting a better deal, and it's doesn't break the bank to offer more potatoes or rice.  The girl taking our order was terrible.  We were the only ones in line and she wanted to rush us.   She had the ""I just work here"" attitude and wasn't any help on what to order at this brand new restaurant.  However the rest of the staff was great.  It very much had the ""Grand Opening"" feel; where they barrage you with attention.  Kinda the like the way Chipotle was the first 3 weeks of its opening. If I wanted a yeeroh, I'd come here.  But it's just another Fast Casual eatery like Chipotle, Noodles&Company, or Pei Wei.  As soon as the ""New Cool Place"" aura dissipates, they'll have to fight hard to keep a strong customer base between Panera and Chipotle, which are on the same street.  So I recommend that you come and try it, cuz we often make the mistake not appreciating things until they're gone.  And this is one of the only places in Nashville that DOESN'T serve a shredded up lamb hot dog and then calls it a Gyro.",Taziki’s Mediterranean Cafe,6157242276,95 reviews,2011-11-11,"Nashville, TN",/biz/tazikis-mediterranean-cafe-nashville,4.0,58,"Washington, DC",Simon K.

"3001 W End AveNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"Taziki's has made me believe in second chances. Let me explain.I first had Taziki's as take-out. Twice, in fact. They were mildly disappointing both times- I had gyros and the taziki (in the name of the restaurant!) was too sour and the sides were not impressive (particularly the rice). They were skimpy on the lamb and the pita wasn't as soft as I was hoping. But this was also when the restaurant just opened, and I am comparing to Athens, one of the better Greek places in the area.But then, this week, I ate in at Taziki's and it totally redeemed itself. The service was prompt, the hummus was delicious and I ordered the oven-roasted pork tenderloin, which was amazing. The salad with the dressing, first off, was really quite good- the dressing was perfect, not too sour at all. The pork was cooked well and the aioli was SO good.

"3001 W End AveNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"I visited Taziki's for the first time a few days ago.  I am not impressed.  Why?  Well, there are a couple of reasons: customer service (or lack thereof), and the food.1) Customer Service: I walked in the door and no one greeted me.  It took me a second to figure out where to go and order, and where to get a menu.  IMHO the register should be close to the door.  You have to walk past all the cooks to get to the register.....weird.  When I made it to the register, the cashier wasn't very helpful.  He just kinda stared at me for a few minutes until I ordered.  I ordered the Dolmades plate and a water.  I asked where I need to get my water and the cashier pointed to the counter to my right.  I sat down and waited on the food (I'll get to that).  I sat in the room with the windows, and there were 4 other tables in there in addition to mine.  A lady came through, and I kid you not, asked every single other table if they were ok, needed anything, needed to-go boxes, etc - but did not come by my table once.  Why I wonder?2) Food:I was really craving falafel, but soon realized they do not make it or serve it.  I was bummed, but I saw the dolmades plate, which comes with a Greek Salad, Greek Dressing, Taziki's sauce, and Pita.  And I ordered it.  The dolmades themselves were unlike any I've had before - they were gigantic and I could not cut them with a knife.  I basically obliterated the first one and just picked the rest up with my fingers (quite messy).  What I didn't like about them is that they tasted of nothing but lemon pepper.  Not fresh lemon, I'm talking lemon pepper seasoning, and a ton of it.  Just ruined it for me.  There was a ton of salad in the middle of the plate which was fine......I mean, it was salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and red peppers.  Nothing special.  I was very puzzled with the pita....there was one very small, very thin pita chip.  That's it.  I guess I expected a bit more than that and I would have welcomed it - with all that lemon pepper the whole plate was an acidic mess.I did enjoy the ambiance so there's one positive thing.  Doubt I'll be back though...for nearly $11 I felt a bit ripped off.",Taziki’s Mediterranean Cafe,6157242276,201 reviews,2013-02-01,"Brentwood, TN",/biz/tazikis-mediterranean-cafe-nashville,2.0,58,"Washington, DC",Erin J.

"3001 W End AveNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"Dale Wasem's casual West End restaurant serves Greek salads, gyros and more. I ordered at the marble counter and received my basket of food at the table within ten minutes. It takes a little time since each order is prepared when you order. A hot griddle was used to crisp my spanakopita rollup which was crunchy on the outside with tender chicken, spinach and feta on the inside. The two rollups were cut in half for a total of four fair size pieces. As with other weekday specials it came with a side. Mine was slightly tart tomato cucumber salad, also crisp. Of the two big rooms I decided on the one with brick and natural wood ceiling. Wall decor is minimalist which helps to lend a relaxed ambience. I'm not sure the food is better than nearby Kalamatas, but the atmosphere sure is.

The menu is posted about the counter - full of moderately priced, yummy tasting tacos, burritos and nachos. I ordered the nachos and my husband order the tacos (with ghost pepper habanero cheese!)... others in my group ordered a variety of items that they all thoroughly enjoyed. My only complaint was the cleanliness of the tables. Again, we were in there VERY late (early), so maybe they had been slammed up until we walked in - but I would have appreciated a quick table wipe down. Every tabletop in the place was filthy and we quickly wiped one down and ate.

CON:  one size drink cups over priced....and wish they were Styrofoam... better for ice retaining... too costly for the drinks...

"129 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"By far the worst taco I've had in years.  The poor girl who took my order clearly had never eaten Mexican food either because she had no idea what a quesadilla is. The shredded beef on the taco was seasoned for barbecue, and way too salty.  The rice was so undercooked it hurt to eat. The beans were made to be very spicy as a last ditch effort to save the batch, I can only assume. Not only will I NEVER go back, I feel it is my duty as a good American to tell everyone I meet to avoid this place like the plague!In addition to the bottom of the barrel cuisine, the entire restaurant was filthy.

"129 2nd Ave NNashville, TN 37201",3.5,"i love tacos. and burritos. and chips and salsa. and guacamole. basically, anything inspired by countries south of our border. the hubs and i had a downtown walkabout after comicon, and decided to pop on in here. i mean, tacos. that's all i needed to know. the husband, knew since before he was my husband, the only thing he really needed to woo me with was an awesome burrito. but not the nasty taco bell kind. our relationship would have ended if he tried to woo me with taco bell. we dodged questionable stains on the sidewalk, skipped over puddles of liquids i shall not mention, and shot the breeze with the folks in between living arrangements on our way here from the convention center.this is one of those places like moe's--where you build your own burrito via verbal coaching...except this place is like a biker bar version of moe's. i come here when i feel awesome, i go to moe's when i feel like june cleaver. maybe i'd come here if felt like a bored june cleaver.....anyhow, the meat is fresh, they grill it up behind the counter and then dice it and put it in your meal. none of that fake pink-goo chicken crap. this actually came from a real chicken. like cluck cluck...not a fraken-chicken like mcdonalds and taco bell uses. the veggies are fresh. we were upstairs when they were preparing/cutting peppers and onions, so we KNOW it's fresh. you should go here, you won't be disappointed.EDIT!  EDIT! I forgot to mention the glory that is the chips and guacamole.  the chips, they aren't just any chips, I think they are made from tortillas created by the hands of Mary...(the one from the bible) (not Jesus' mom Mary) (that's blasphemous), the other mary.

We arrived over an hour before closing, there were no customers (now I know why). We ordered our food and they pulled it out from on top the chopping board (not refrigerated). They cut different meats all together (good thing there were no allergies!). They never reheated the meat on the grill or anything, just put them into two corn tortillas and added toppings. At one point, the guy behind the counter remade a taco, we aren't sure why but it had to be big because they didn't seem to mind sub-par food. The second person handled the food with no gloves and was also working the register. We sat at an empty table, which was the cleanest but there was a lot of food in the crevice of the table. One worker began sweeping underneath me as I sat to eat, which was strange. The tacos were cold. In fact the corn tortillas were soggy and stuck together. The meat was room temperature. The cheese was obviously spoiled (cojita that tasted more like Blue).

Which, I love cheese, so that in itself made me excited. The soup was not great. It was so terribly chunky, which I did not at all expect. What's worse is the chunks just seemed like canned tomatoes. It's such a shame cause the overall flavor was really good. I may go back to Jason's deli and try something different. Again, I rarely feel like salad, and usually prefer something spicy, which is why I chose that panini. There's got to be something worth the walk for lunch, just not sure what yet.",Jason’s Deli,6153409991,46 reviews,2014-11-16,"Nashville, TN",/biz/jasons-deli-nashville,2.0,47,"Washington, DC",Alexandra F.
"2028 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"I've been to more than 50 Jason's across the country and always swing through this one when in Nashville. Located virtually across the street from Vandy there's always a friendly crowd around, the staff is upbeat, energetic and friendly and the food remains consistent (just be careful coming during the lunch rush, it'll be packed). Meanwhile, crowds amass for a reason. There's few better places where you can order a half sandwich and soup or a salad bar for fewer than $10 and get quality. Jason's does just that, delivering fresh meats and quality offerings to your table without making them too pricy. The salad bar remains well stocked with quality greens, has ample veggies and coupled with a bowl of soup is a meal that keeps anyone full. While there are endless options for lunch in the area, we come here when we want to keep it simple and not spend too much money.

"2028 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"This Jason's Deli franchise location is on West End Avenue on the north-east corner and across the street from Vanderbilt University.  After so many weeks (Peoria, Nashville, Miami) on the road, I was really glad to find a place with a variety - almost a plethora - of healthy choices.  It was on the walk to/from the client site and after consistent twelve-hour days, it was nice to stop in for something to eat for dinner while dealing with e-mail (Mostly true, I was also resting up before heading to the Broadway Brewhouse...)Don't get me wrong, you can get a muffaletta, po'boys, a Reuben, Chicken Alfredo and potatoes the size of your head with a bucket of sour cream, cheese and bacon, not one but five kinds of cheesecake, carrot cake, brownies and some sex-ay, dee-licious looking cookies - and I love the IDEA of every single one of those fat calories, BUT......if you're jonesing for the opposite and you have been repeatedly disappointed by the lack of fresh, healthy things to eat, then there are salads, soups, reduced-calorie ""slimwiches"" (I hate made up words) and wraps, healthy sides of steamed vegetables, fruit and coleslaw.This incarnation of Jason's is bright and clean with matching servers and reasonable prices.",Jason’s Deli,6153409991,161 reviews,2008-03-26,"San Francisco, CA",/biz/jasons-deli-nashville,4.0,47,"Washington, DC",Nancy W.

"2028 W End AveNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"I discovered this place by accident. A friend was in from out of town, it was cold, and we were desperate trying to find a place that had a good selection of soup, for not a lot of cash. We happened to drive by, and decided to give it a try. Parking sucks when it's really busy, but you can usually find a place, you just may have to walk a little...but that's Nashville. They have a great selection of soups, vegetarian and otherwise, but I always go back to the good ol' vegetable. It's flavorful, and filling, but not too much. The first two times I got half of a  portobello 'wrapini' with my soup and loved it. The veggies are great, and I love when places use the special flavor wraps. The last time I went, I tried the salad bar, and when I went up to make my salad, I didn't even know where to start! They have different lettuce options, every type of addition to a salad you can imagine, variety of nuts, dressings, pasta salads (and tons of other  kinds), hummus, muffins...the list goes on! I was overwhelmed, but it was all really good!

I have my good and bad mornings, but it's always a little better after going in there. It's impossible to be cranky around that crew. They serve Bongo Java, which is fine, but what I really want to talk about is the rice crispy treats. First they're gigantic. Secondly they're delicious. I don't know if they make the Spicy Pistachio w/chocolate chips one regularly, but it made me weep with joy.  I don't indulge in sweets that often, but I swear I'll go back to the gym if it means I get to have it again.

"701 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",4.5,"The name and logo are enough to make you pay attention. That's a good thing. There's a lot to enjoy about this quirky coffee shop.First things first, parking is tight. There's a small lot and side street street parking but both can be scarce. You'll need to enjoy/employ some good parking karma in order to sidle in to this Gulch mainstay. Once you've parked, enter the door on the left (if you're looking at the building with 8th to your back). If you enter the building from the right, you've entered in to Jackalope. Yep, you can cross the shared space into ZolliKoffee, but you might have to go through some beer lovers to do so. If it's coffee time, walk to the left.It's worth it. You'll scoot into the narrow walkway to see a whole list of traditional brews to which you can add your pick of seasonal flavors. Being a coffee shop, ZK has no shortage of baked goods, sandwiches and the like. I decided on an Americano with seasonal hazelnut flavoring. Since I was going all in, I ordered a piece of cake. Don't judge me; it looked incredible. The barista took my order and I took a seat in the dining area. No sooner had I booted up my computer and logged in to the network than was I greeted with the perfect coffee beverage for the start of a mid-autumn weekend AND a SLAB of dense, delicious, dark chocolate cake with almonds. I don't know if this cake is available all the time but from the first bite, I vowed to order it every time I saw it at ZK. Again, in case I didn't make myself clear: I received a slab, not a slice... a slab of cake. I ate every last bite... and I'd do it again. Rather than a sleepy, neighborhood coffee shop (not a slam; I like said sort of coffee shops), I peg ZK more of a working coffee shop. You *do* stuff here. Whether you're having a meeting, working on your lap top or planning an event, ZK is the space that inspires you to do more/something. Next time you need or have a bolt of inspiration, head over to 8th and make it happen.",ZolliKoffee,6158734315,1642 reviews,2015-06-08,"Nashville, TN",/biz/zollikoffee-nashville-2,4.0,41,"Washington, DC",Johnny T.

I think I was confused with the shared space that they have with Jackalope brewery. The coffee area is very small and I could easily see it being backed up during peak hours. I ordered my usual, an almond milk latte and it was pretty decent but nothing overwhelmingly good. What was really fantastic was their cookies n' cream rice krispie treat... OMG. Hello yum. The thing was enormous and delicious! They had other flavors that looked pretty tempting as well. They share a porch with the brewery, but I could see it being a nice place too hang out if they aren't too crowded. Overall, I would go back but need to try it a few more times before I up my rating.

"701 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",4.5,"On day two of the 2014 Yelp Spring Break, we were scheduled for a brunch at the Jackalope Brewing Company. Through this event, we were introduced to the little attached coffee shop next door called ZolliKoffee!When you walk in, you'll notice the deep purple walls, super eclectic canvas artwork, homemade menu boards, glass casing full of pastries, different colored mugs and super nice baristas! This place was super cool! They had outside picnic table seating and more in the Jackalope area. The service was top notch! The baristas were rad, personable and super efficient. I was loving it!For the brunch event, we were given tickets that could be used at both Jackalope and ZolliKoffee. I decided to get the mango juice and a latte. Although the juice was prepackaged and made by another manufacturer, it was still sweet and delicious. Now when it came to the latte, I was blown away. They make their own simple syrup flavors for the coffees. On this visit, they offered double vanilla bean, chocolate, caramel and mint almond. I went with the mint almond and sure glad I did! There was a nice hint of mint in every sip and the almond flavor made my latte rich and delicious! Heaven! Large lattes go for around $4.25 and so worth it!If you're in Nashville and looking for a cool place for a pick me up, you NEED to check this place out! You will not be disappointed.

"701 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",4.5,ZolliKoffee and Jackalope Brewing company are in the same building. Slightly confusing when you walk in after you park and walk straight into Jackalope. Zolli is in a little room straight ahead. The menu isn't very extensive but who needs a lot of crazy choices as long as the coffee is good? They make all of their syrups in house which is great. The two girl employees were very friendly and gave their opinions on which syrup was the best when my sister asked. My sister ordered an iced latte with one of the syrups (I don't remember which one.) I ordered an iced coffee with honey and cinnamon. I only had to add a little bit of half and half to make it even better which is saying a lot about that coffee. I usually like a little coffee with my cream but this coffee was so good. The cinnamon was a great touch. I love cinnamon and I usually don't like honey. They had a few pastries but none that just captured my attention enough to want it. They also had a few sandwiches and other food items but I wasn't in the mood for any of those either. They do have a minimum of $4 if you decide to pay with a credit card. We decided to sit outside since it was a nice day. They had a few picnic tables and it was awesome just to sit outside with my sister and enjoy my iced coffee.

"701 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",4.5,"Been wanting to try this place for a couple months, and sadly just can't recommend it. Here we go:1. Went on a Sunday morning with a friend, around 10:15am. Place was a ghost town, which was surprising.2. I wanted a breakfast sandwich that I've read about on Yelp. They were completely out of eggs. Seriously? On a Sunday morning? Send one of the girls to a store 3 minutes away to grab a couple dozen eggs. Really don't understand this one..3. Asked if they did French Press coffee. They both acted confused and had to search around to see if they had one. This was strange. Coffee shop people should always know French Press, right?? Maybe I was the only person in months who asked?4. Ordered two hand-drip coffees, and two muffins. 5. Muffins were amazing. Pretty sure they are cake. I could eat another right this sec.6. My friends' coffee came out after quite some time. Wasn't hot enough. 7. My coffee came out a good ten minutes after hers. That is annoying. Mine wasn't hot enough either. (and I don't like coffee scalding hot or anything like that). They were both just too cold. And yes, I realize that hand-drip takes a while to make, but the place was basically empty. Make two at a time - don't make one friend have to sit and stare at the other for ten minutes wondering where the hell theirs is. We all hate it when this happens to us.8. When they gave us our coffee, no one asked or mentioned anything about cream, sugar, etc. This is weird because they delivered the coffee to us, then we realized that the cream and everything is back up at the counter. So, this whole thing was strange, mainly because we both had to follow the person directly back to where they just came from to use cream. Anywho.9. The coffee was good, but not as strong as what I was lead to believe when ordering. I would have added a shot of espresso or something.9. The place itself, tables, etc. are are great. Plenty of seating, natural light inside for writing, drawing, whatever. 10. Nothing really makes me want to return. I personally think the drip coffee at two local coffee shops is much more complex and balanced than this hand-poured here. Never thought I'd say that.Not that I'm necessarily proud of this, but I can list 4 local coffee spots around that I haven't had even one quarter of these issues at.

I had a sweet and spicy turkey panini with an orzo salad side and a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie.  The sandwich was great.  The orzo salad was fantastic...seriously.  The same nice guy added caddied walnuts to it which made it one of the most perfect pasta salads ever made (and I don't even like pasta salad).  The cookie was a reasonably-sized, reasonably priced, perfect circle of sweetness that just melted in my mouth. I  also had an Americano, which was excellent.  There was also live music which was kind of annoying at first because I wanted to read, but then I remembered I was in Nashville and turned my frown upside down.  Most people were working on laptops not paying much attention, but the three guys who played and sang were all really great artists.  The last person I heard had such a beautiful voice, I didn't want to leave, but I was running late by that time.  My afternoon at this place was truly a treat.  Too bad clientele is not more diverse.",ZolliKoffee,6158734315,14 reviews,2013-12-09,"Chicago, IL",/biz/zollikoffee-nashville-2,5.0,41,"Washington, DC",Mia H.

"701 8th Ave SNashville, TN 37203",4.5,"ZolliKoffee is a great and welcomed addition to the Jackaloupe Brewing company.  I love the opportunity to have a different brew under the same roof.  Plus, whenever the food trucks are posted in front of the brewery, you are guaranteed for some exceptional cafe fare.First off, the iced coffee is my favorite.  They use Klatch coffee which is amazing.  The coffee is cold brewed and is not acidic to the taste.  My second favorite is the Chai Lattes.  They make their own blend so it is very unique.  I like a Chai that does not overpower the taste buds.All the pastry treats are homemade.  I love the rice krispy treats with chunks of chocolate and the chocolate muffins they have on hand as well.  When I am not binging on chocolate, the sandwiches are also a favorite of mine.  I love the Turkey, Cheese and Habenero Pineapple Sammy.This is a great place to go if you want to entertain guests that like both beer and coffee.  It is literally the best of both worlds.Also, I belive there is a $4 credit min on cards.  Bring cash if you just want a cup of joe.",ZolliKoffee,6158734315,392 reviews,2013-07-29,"Brentwood, TN",/biz/zollikoffee-nashville-2,5.0,41,"Washington, DC",Amanda C.

"6601 Sugar Valley DrNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"So I feel it's necessary to give an update on what was once one of my very favorite little restaurants...We usually go about once a month to this place and went on Friday night.  Ordered what I usually order because it is seriously so yummy I just can't bring myself to order anything else-  The Greek Salad with blackened chicken-  When it arrived all I can say was incredible disappointment!!  I wish so much I had taken a photo because I was in true disbelief!  It appeared like a tomato salad- there was LITERALLY less than a cup of greens (arugula I think, the kind that are tiny lil' pieces of frilly leaves) NO ROMAINE anywhere-  the only way the ""Salad"" portion could be best described is as a GARNISH!  Then on top were 4  1/2 inch sliced tomatoes, feta, olives and some cucumbers.  I felt like I just bought a $13 tomato!!  I was so disturbed that I asked the waitress what happened to the salad...her response was that they've changed it.  She returned with the check later and said she spoke to management and that they recommended that the next time I order it ""the old way"" and they will add romaine to it.  And she said that she took off our iced tea as a compensation since I was disappointed.  ???  Hmmm...let me see if I understand...You deducted $2. from our bill after you charged me $9. for the salad and $4. for the chicken....Yeah, that seems about right.  NOT.  My husband ordered the Southside Pasta- and said his had no flavor either- and the pasta itself costs $12 and an upcharge of $4 for chicken!  And his portion was MUCH smaller than they used to serve.  We basically chalked up our experience that they've definitely changed their portion sizes to cut their costs while STILL charging way TOO MUCH for not as good food- If you ask me, I think it's to cover their new outside dining patio.  Why mess with something when it works?!Such a HUGE disappointment.   Not sure we will be back.",Southside Grill,6159414460,4 reviews,2015-09-20,"Brentwood, TN",/biz/southside-grill-nashville-2,2.0,65,"Washington, DC",Lisa M.

The waitress told us ""they must have come out of the microwave. Not sure if that is common but if we're gona pay $25 a person for dinner it shouldn't be microwaved.

You know how some places it feels like the waitstaff is trying to stab each other in the back? This place is the opposite. The staff feels like family.ALL of the apps are my favorite. Crab cakes, calamari are the tops, but I love the way I know I can choose ANY app for any meal and I won't be disappointed. Also, cheese sticks are for kids, but not these cheese sticks! Great taste without weighing you down a ton.For dinner, I love all the sandwiches though I've never had the chicken sandwich.For the entrees, I honestly don't know how they offer the quality of entree they do for these prices. If these entrees were at some other restaurant, you could easily add $10 to each.For all of this, the atmosphere somehow let's you choose whether it's a really nice date night out, or just relaxed.

Started with the crab cake, it was almost all crab meat and came with a wowza aioli type sauce that has capers in it. One squeeze of lemon and I was fork battling my husband for more than my fare share. For dinner I had the Pumped Chicken (see photo). Half of a rotisserie chik that had delicious smoky skin and every bit of meat inside was juicy and flavorful. White beans and onions as a side. They have Fat Tire in good ole TN so that also accompanied my meal. Hubs had the pork and commented that the meat needed a little more smoke flavor, but that the barbecue sauce was rad.

"6601 Sugar Valley DrNashville, TN 37211",4.0,"Sophies Bistro is now Southside Grill.  My daughter, a neighbor and I went Saturday night.  I ordered the Louisiana Pasta and a house salad for an extra $2.00.  My daughter had a cheeseburger and my neighbor had the rib eye steak sandwich.  Everything was okay.  I would call the salad a McSalad.  Apparently,  the dressing is pre measured into ramekins and the salad is like a bag salad with some cheese and chopped up tomato.  My pasta was good but nothing was delicious as in,  ""Can't wait to come back and try something else"". It's sad because this part of town needs a good restaurant.  I would say that it is overpriced too.  My pasta  came with one very small piece of garlic bread and cost  $13.95  (chicken , mushrooms, linguine and sauce) I had to pay $2 for a house salad, making this meal $15.95.   Their wine selection is excellent and so was the service.  I always ask myself if I would make a special trip to return to this restaurant...  and the answer is ""no"" .",Southside Grill,6159414460,41 reviews,2009-04-26,"Antioch, TN",/biz/southside-grill-nashville-2,2.0,65,"Washington, DC",Denise R.
"1538 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Stopped here twice last week following concerts at the Schermerhorn. Conveniently close to the venue. Street parking and lot parking both available, although as with most parking in Nashville lot parking can be pricey. The stuffed mushroom appetizer was a bit different from many places inasmuch as these were stuffed with cream cheese & herbs (delicately flavored)...but -- here comes the twist...heavily battered and deep fried, served with horseradish sauce. Good or bad? Actually I enjoyed them quite a bit...they were less greasy than the fish. But ultimately reminded me of carnival food. (Not a dig...just my observation.)First night entreé was Thursday's Special: fish and chips. I wasn't totally disappointed, but did have slightly higher hopes. The portion size was just right--4 pieces. The batter dipped fish good, save for the squirt of grease that popped up with my first knife slice. Not drained well enough - served too quickly? Nonetheless, flavor and texture were great. Throw away the tartare sauce and just top 'em with Malt Vinegar. Fries fine, but also just a bit soft, not crisp. Second night we fared much better. My wife had the Sunday night Special: Shepherd's Pie. Great, flavorful, but just a tiny bit salty. I had the Angus burger (rare) with grilled onions and Pepper jack Cheese. Absolutely one of the best burgers I've had in Nashville. Cooked to perfection, juicy, great beef flavor. (BTW, you can choose your toppings.)Thursday night football.

Veggies on the side were a smidge bland for my taste, but I was so happy with the main dish I couldn't care less about the steamed veggies. Sports are the star here.

"1538 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I was here for USA vs. Mexico (first time USA has won in Mexico!!!) earlier this month, since this is home of the Nashville American Outlaws chapter (soccer supporters group for USA). On LP Field game days, they use another bar downtown, but this is the watch party bar. The chapter greeted me with open arms as a Texan visiting Nashville for work. Treating some guys to some beers was also very cheap. I think the MacGuiness amber was something like $2.50/pint, a special for the group. There were also other specials, and being from Texas, I was impressed the bar had Shiner Bock. So after three beers and 3-4 Woodchuck Ambers (ok ok, I still haven't acquired the beer taste!), my tab was only $20 - very awesome!We were on the patio because trivia was going on inside, so I guess this occurs on Wednesday nights. I did like how I couldn't hear the trivia going on, even though we were outside (some bars are too loud with the trivia). Maybe it was because we were so excited about the game. The Nashville chapter isn't over the top with the chants, but sings/plays the snare at the appropriate times during the game. Add free, ample parking across the street to the mix, and I can see why people call this place home.

"1538 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Good Bar food with large portions and Smithwicks on tap.  Live music, lots of Irish pictures and pretty good service.  Con- slightly smoky always.  Because Nashville doesn't have many smoke bars, this place always has this.  Usually a dealbreaker.Good sandwiches, check the photos.  Yes people come here to watch Soccer, but they don't chant much, if at all.  Oh and I am not a fan of parking here, you have to go around the round about and park in this weird rocky parking lot across the street.  Red Rooster and Tin Roof is down the street and there's usually music and such, plus no smoke.  But Dan Mcguiness is more of a guys place.",Dan McGuinness Irish Pub,6152521991,235 reviews,2012-12-18,"Chicago, IL",/biz/dan-mcguinness-irish-pub-nashville,4.0,81,"Washington, DC",Will M.

"1538 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Seems like some people are drankin' the haterade about Dan McGuinness.  I finally went last night for Trivia night and I actually thought this place was great.First off, I immediately loved the patio area.  Large space with plenty of tables.  Seems like a good place to have some drinks and hang out with your friends.BUT we went inside so we could play trivia.  It is your basic Irish pub.  I did like the way the bar was set up in a big square - more spots to sit!  Plus I like sitting at the corners so that you can semi face the person you are with.The food looked really good - Scotch eggs, fish and chips (two sizes), Shepherd's pie, even an Irish sampler where you get a little of all of it.  I, however, opted for the pub salad with salmon because I'm trying to be good.  The salmon was tasty, the greens were fresh, and the vinaigrette was good.  I really liked the crunch bacon pieces on the salad.  I devoured this salad - it really hit the spot!  Looks like they pour a good Guinness and they make a good black and tan.  I drank vodka though because beer is just tooooo filling.  Our waitress brought drinks around fairly regularly but she was not the fastest or most attentive.This was trivia night (Wednesday) so the place was busy but not packed by any means.  The questions start out so easy that we made it through 2 rounds without missing any questions.  I mean, the first question was ""What band's members include Neal Schon and Steve Perry?""  Uh, only my FAVE band in the entire world!  Anyway, the third round and the double down round were brutal, so expect it to get harder and plan your points accordingly.  It came down to a tie between our team and another team and the tiebreaker question could only be described as nonsensical.  However, we pulled it through and ""My Penis is Dublin"" won the evening and a $30 gift certificate for the next time!!  We ROCK!  After trivia the guy continued playing tunes and he was rocking some 90s grunge that absolutely made me want to call off work and just drink all night.  I was a fan.Granted I have not been here on a weekend where there is apparently popped collars and college crowd?  I would definitely want to avoid that.  But for a solid weeknight happy hour or a solid trivia experience I would have to say I liked it very much!  I'll be back for sure, if for nothing else than to try the fish and chips!",Dan McGuinness Irish Pub,6152521991,1027 reviews,2010-09-16,"Nashville, TN",/biz/dan-mcguinness-irish-pub-nashville,4.0,81,"Washington, DC",Nickie G.

"1538 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"This pub's main strengths are decent bar food, well-behaved clientele,  a beautiful ambience, and location, location, location. We ordered a full order of fish & chips. Being from Milwaukee, we're not easily pleased in this department; and neither of us really cared for the rather bland tasting Harp lager batter of this order. There was no TRUE ""Beer"" flavor in the batter, it barely registered strong enough for my taste. Perhaps I'm used to the stronger Northern preparations where the bottle of brew smacks you in the forehead. This was just not enough for me.It WAS better than most fish & chips I've had in TN, however; and the lemon tartar sauce was hands-down perfect. If you're not a fanaticist, you will be pleased. If you are, it's in the ""okay"" category. I weep, I weep for my hometown. Adding to my calorie-fest, we split an order of Bailey's Irish-cream cheescake with chocolate sauce and chocolate graham crust. It was indescribably good. I had't really looked forward to it; preferring my cheesecake a little plainer, but this one changed my mind. Live wild, I say. Wild! ;) The flavors were perfectly complementary and not overdone. The amount of Bailey's was just subtle enough not to be too sweet.So, this place is what you call RELIABLE. Reliable for decent drinks, decent staff, decent food. The staff was a wee bit harried that night, but it was CMA fest- and they handled it VERY well. You can ALWAYS bring an out-of-towner in here.

"1538 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"This is one of my favorite (reasonably priced) restaurants in Nashville and over the years, I've tried many of their dishes including bangers & mash (very good), shepherd's pie (very good) & their cheeseburger (huge but not particularly memorable). Try the Scotch eggs sometime when you aren't on a date. They're delicious! However, I love their fish & chips which is what I had today. It was their $6 special. I'm a sucker for fish & chips and consider myself a connoisseur. In my estimation, this is the best in Tennessee. The light batter is perfect and not particularly greasy. The cod is tasty and perfectly cooked. The lunch portion was perfect though I have had trouble with the dinner portion feeling guilty over-stuffing myself. The ambiance is basically what an American thinks an Irish pub looks like. Soccer on the flat screens. High backed leather booths. Comfortable but not even close to authentic. They have a full bar stocked with dark beer and Irish whiskey. I have started and ended evenings there and always have a good time but today's meal was nonalcoholic. The service has usually been good even when they're busy and today was no exception. The attractive waitress was efficient but not annoying. I notice someone didn't like the patio. I don't either and won't eat there if the restaurant's full. They present live music or a DJ on the patio in the summer but I don't go there for that.

"1538 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"The original (this one) is not nearly as good as its little brother in Cool Springs. Perhaps it's the location, perhaps it was the fact that I went in at 3:30 in the afternoon on a Tuesday. The bartender acknowledged me as I entered, telling me to ""sit anywhere you like"". I sat on the corner of the bar, nearest the door, as I was meeting friends. This is a highly visible location. Still, with one other guest seated at the bar at the time, it took her a full three minutes to make it back around to greet me. Forgivable, until my order: a draft beer and a Jameson, neat. I got the beer right away, but waited while she flirted with what appeared to be two regulars who had full drinks and food in front of them. She then poured 2 beers for people who sat down after me. After a full six minutes had elapsed, she told me she hadn't forgotten about me (which is bartender speak for: oh crap I forgot about you til JUST NOW) and then I waited another two minutes before she poured me the Jameson --into a plastic shot glass, no less. Also, I ordered the Jameson because one of the people I was meeting had told me it was two for one on Tuesdays. There was no mention of this when I ordered.

Way to never take our order, be super standoffish when you finally manage to meander  over to our table, and then wander around trying to figure out which table said drinks belong to. It was not that busy the night we were there. It's not that hard to do your job and be polite while doing it. Also, I know it's not the fault of the establishment (but these do seem to be their typical patrons and the folks you get to hang out around when spending time at Dan McGuinness')- but there's nothing worse than when somebody is performing music in a half-empty outside area and the patrons talk loudly amongst themselves and then don't clap when each song is over. The pompous, self important 30-something young professionals, cellphones attached to their ears, in embroidered English Laundry shirts and flared out-of-style-everywhere-else-but-Nashville True Religion jeans will hopefully each get shit on by a passing bird or step in dog shit sometime in the near future when they're being rude and dismissive to everyone around them.

"1538 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"My fiance and I had our Wedding Welcome party in the outdoor covered patio section of Dan McGuinness and it was an absolute blast. Since our guests were all coming from out of town (us included), we wanted to host a welcome party the night before our wedding at a fun place where people could drink, mingle, and eat some finger food. It didn't cost anything to rent the space, we paid a very reasonable fee per person for the food (which included salad, pinwheel sandwiches, potato skins, chicken skewers with sauces, and spinach and artichoke dip), and the drinks (which were billed at a per drink price and tallied at the end for us to cover) were awesome. Coming from Chicago, we are pretty critical when it comes to food, drinks, and service and Dan McGuinness easily met and exceeded our expectations. They even set up a microphone for us on the stage for speeches and had the audio set up so we could plug in our IPod. The staff was awesome and prompt in replacing the food and bringing draft beers from the inside bar to those who ordered them. We wanted our guests to be able to drink whatever they wanted and we were shocked to find out that almost every drink (including grey goose and don juilio) was $9 or under. Amazing! We had reserved the space for 2 hours, but when our time was up we were having so much fun we wanted to keep it going. The staff never rushed us out of there and even the DJ was nice to let us play our IPod until they were completely set up and ready to play their music. Our party, which originally was supposed to go from 7-9 ended up lasting until a little past 11pm with the drinks flowing the whole time. The bartenders knew who was in our party and continued to put their drinks on our tab, which was shockingly low at the end of the night (considering how many drinks our 75 person party ordered).After researching almost every bar and restaurant in Nashville to find a place to host our Welcome Party, I am so happy we ended up with Dan McGuinness. It was so much fun and I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to host an event in the Nashville area. They were so much cheaper (and better) than the other places we looked at and the vibe was fun, chill, and definitely a party. Thanks again, Dan McGuinness!

Second: Nightlife.  Late nights, live bands, popped collars, and the sup dude/college crowd.

When he arrived, he had to have noticed that the tables on the patio needed to be wiped down, but he didn't bother. Great pub beer selection. Not so on the wine options. As our server noted, ""We are a pub, so we don't really care about the wine selection."" And he is right! Beer was tasty! Chicken wrap was not bad either. People watched the folks passing by on Demonbreun Street, but it was a bit dark along the sidewalk. Could barely notice the homeless guy sleeping on the bench twenty yards away.

I can only report on the nightlife aspect, and you may not like what I have to say if you are a collar-poppin, beer guzzlin', fratty type guy. Just giving you a heads up.Dan McGuinness is the type of place you wander to at 1am when you've got your buzz on, and the decent late night options are slim. We arrived in the midst of it on a Saturday night during the Vanderbilt/Belmont graduation weekend, so it was expectedly packed with college kids, most of which were severely preppy and severely wasted. Admittedly, I was obliterated, but not preppy, so that gave me a slight advantage. The bartenders were quick, I'll give them that, and it was fun to sing along with the live band to ""Don't Stop Believin'"" at 1:30am. But besides that, I give 'em a big old Eh. I most likely would not set foot in this place had I not previously been drunk enough to decide it was a good idea.

"1538 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Ok so I think this is one of those over priced places that you are paying for ambiance only. However, I have to give them props for knowing how to serve a Guinness (not to cold) and for their fish and chips. From time to time, my husband gets a hankering for something greasy and usually fish and chips are up his alley. I can't say that we have searched high and low for them but we have been to a couple of places and the breading here on the white fish is his favorite so far in Nashville. They also serve it with cold slaw and vinegar the way pub food should be. I got these fried egg things from the appetizer menu that are hard boiled eggs encrusted with cheese and spices, breaded and deep fried. My god, I don't think you should eat it often for fear of a coronary event but it definitely rocked my world for a minute.

We also had two waitresses catering to our drink orders and they stayed pretty on top of it. I can't remember what they were, but we did get happy hour prices as well.

Anyway, I went here for lunch today and was not impressed. I was hoping to find that just-like-mom-used-to-make irish food that I can never find. A bit of back story; my mom and her family are F.O.B. Irish (if you don't know what FOB stands for, message me. and yes, it really was a boat), so I had plenty of potatoes, cabbage, and the like growing up. I'm an Irish citizen too, and I was raised thinking bland food was the norm, so as a foodie  I am a bit of a late bloomer.  Tangent....Did you ever hear this joke: Q:  What does an Irish person do when you ask them to hand you the hot sauce? A: They pass you the ketchup. The cheese soup was good and hearty, but I thought it was too salty. But then again, in my house we treated salt like it was saffron; only to be used sparingly.  The Irish Stew was good, but I never had Old Bay, or whatever it was, sprinkled all over my steamed vegies before.  And the damn thing has been repeating on me all day. I keep burping, and I'm supposed to go running tonight, so that's not good.I thought the beer selection should have been better.

I have seen that aftermath of some of them.  The bartenders tend to be very attractive and some of them are extremely friendly and a little flirty to boot.  I enjoy going there with friends and just hanging out and having a good time.  Another thing to know is since they do allow people to smoke inside children are not permitted.  This is not the place to go for family night with the kiddies.  Take them to Chuckie Cheese instead.",Dan McGuinness Irish Pub,6152521991,76 reviews,2012-04-01,"Nashville, TN",/biz/dan-mcguinness-irish-pub-nashville,5.0,81,"Washington, DC",Chad R.

I probably shouldn't talk about it here, though. I like the outdoor patio they have at Dan McGuinness and the live music. I'm not sure I would try to eat here. It is a college-aged crowd which is not so much my thing anymore, but that's kind of my opinion of the whole strip on Demonbreun St. which is why I rarely go out here.On the plus side, our rugby team did go to watch a match on tv here.

"1538 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"Dan McGuinness is one of my favorite lunch spots in Nashville. I don't live nearby, so I've never sampled the night life, but they have a decent assortment of beer (including Newcastle, which is one of my favorites) and Woodchuck Cider.If you go for lunch, the place starts filling up between 11:30 and 11:45. The only time I really had trouble getting a seat was during the World Cup, and even then they got six of us on the patio with no problem. Most of the tables are for two, though some can be pushed together. Chairs are hardwood, but not uncomfortable.I've never had a bad meal here. If you're hungry--portions are generous--start with the beer cheese soup. It's made with Harp and you can taste it just around the edges. Velvety smooth, it's the perfect way to warm up on a cold day.I'm slowly working my way through the menu, which is hard as I keep going back to my favorites. The steak salad is quite tasty--made with feta cheese instead of the bleu that's all the rage. They make an excellent Reuben, just overflowing with meat and serve the dressing on the side so it's only as messy as you make it. I wasn't as joyful over the roast beef sandwich--I like my beef very rare, but it was still yummy.My friends rave about the Shepherd's Pie and Fish 'n' Chips, but my favorite, hands down, is the Irish Stew. Big chunks of lamb that fall apart on your fork, potatoes, onions, carrots, delicate spices. It's served in a fort of mashed potatoes with a hefty helping of cabbage and steamed vegetables--usually carrots, green beans and yellow squash, sometimes brocoli.Service, in my experience, has ranged from very good to excellent. On busy days it may take a bit before getting food out of the kitchen, but it's always come out hot and they're quick with the drink refills.Parking is another reason to get there early, there's just one lot for the entire strip of stores on that section of Demonbreun (right by the roundabout).

"1538 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.5,"I'm taking away a star because of the bathrooms, or rather, the lack of them. Dan McGuinness gets really busy on weekends and the bathroom line snakes around the pub. Even the guys are waiting in line. Plus, there are so many very very drunk people there that the bathrooms get quite gross.I don't really go there on weekends any more because it's more of a college age scene then, but on weeknights it morphs into a late twenties/early thirties hangout. My favorite night to go is Thursday, for the $6 fish and chips. Considering their regular portion will amply feed two, this is a good deal. They have a great ribeye and do a deal on it on Monday nights. There is also a build your own burger night. All the food at DMG's is good, but be warned about the mammoth portions. I love this place because it attracts my countrymen and women. They've had a few Irish bartenders and it's not unusual to meet people from England and Ireland who consider this their ""local."" This is especially true when they are showing soccer or rugby matches. During the World Cup a couple of years ago, DMG opened at eight in the morning to show matches from Japan and served a buffet breakfast to hungry mostly foreign soccer fans.I'm a little bit of a regular here, and I had an experience once which really made me think how much they appreciate their customers. I was having a rotten day and I told the bartender that. They have a steak salad that I love, and I was going to order it, and the bartender said they were out of honey mustard dressing. I told him that was fine, and I would just order something else instead, because I didn't want any of the other dressings. He said it was fine and I should just order that if that was what I wanted. He went to another restaurant and borrowed honey mustard from them so I could have my salad the way I wanted it.

My usual fave is the carbonara, but this time I went with the special. It was something with ground beef - sort of a casserole - and tasty. Maybe I am more of a gourmand than a gourmet.Instead of a salad we had the creamed asparagus soup with broccoli. It was excellent and served plenty hot, too. For dessert we split a large dish of spumoni ice cream.

"5404 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Originally planning to venture up to Germantown, then discovering none of the restaurants had Sunday night hours, we stayed near home and went here, since my husband had been noticing this hidden place being quite busy on a couple of drive-by occasions.There were only a few tables seated when we walked in & it remained this way until we left. The bread that came when we sat down was so soft and warm, I couldn't keep my bear hands off! It came with a tasty sun dried tomato butter, balsamic, good oil, and grated cheese.We started with the Caprese salad ($11) - good/typical and the Tuscan salad ($15) - really good! The marinated tenderloin on the Tuscan was increeedibly yummy...I don't remember everything our waiter said it's marinated in, but the main parts are worchestshire, soy sauce.  The mozzarella fritters are really big and gooey, which is poifect.Out of character for me, I ordered the lobster ravioli ($20) and am soooooooo glad I did.  Oh boy, oh boy, I jump for joy!  The raviolis were not too thick, the sauce was awesome, and the lobster and corn inside was equally awesome.  It came with 3 shrimp on top, which I didn't eat, as I've been in a long-going fight with shrimp.  My husband didn't order from the menu but ordered gnocchi in pesto sauce with shrimp...he gave it 4 stars.  The gnocchi was good, but depending on your taste, it was very potato-y. We ordered the mocha cheesecake and tiramisu to go...the tiramisu was 90% whipped cream and I only had one bite.  The cheesecake was really really good though.It was a lot of food, but the mid and smaller-sized portions (though priced NYC-style, which we're used to, so didn't mind) were fine for us to carry through the whole meal.  We took 1/2 of the gnocchi home too.I don't know the waiter's name, but he was really nice & friendly!  With our 2 salads, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, 1 glass of wine, & $20 tip, our total was $126.  Expensive, yes, but it was really good & worth it :)Will definitely be back!",Finezza Italian Bistro,6153569398,55 reviews,2012-03-12,"Nashville, TN",/biz/finezza-italian-bistro-nashville,4.0,38,"Washington, DC",Emily E.

"5404 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Finezza has yet to disappoint us, whether we visit for a simple dinner for 2 or a group gathering.  We very much enjoy the food and the atmosphere, and most of the waitstaff who've helped us have been incredibly friendly and attentive.I've tried several of the entrees on the menu, which are delicious, substantial, and delivered hot and fresh to the table.  On my last visit, I enjoyed the Whole Wheat Chicken Primavera, which I expected to be hit or miss.  I was thrilled to see that it was steaming hot (that's a good thing in my book) and full of chicken breast, fresh arugula (YUM) and plenty of other veggies.  The chef was also careful to limit the amount of oil in the dish, per my request, which I very much appreciated.  My fiance enjoyed the Cajun Seafood orzo, which was a play on jumbalaya and packed with jumbo shrimp, scallops and Italian sausage, all mixed in a spicy sauce.  I stole a bite and immediately had food envy--as delicious as my entree was, the flavor of the sauce and the fresh seafood definitely stole the show.  All entrees come with a fresh salad and incredible homemade bread.  And the tiramisu?  Can't come to Finezza and not order some.  Seriously, some of the best I've ever had.  Yum, yum and yum.In addition to a delightful dinner party for 2, I've hosted large gatherings at Finezza--one for work, one for my extended family who traveled to Nashville for an event.  Both times, the manager, Karen, was extremely helpful and kind to work with.  She went above and beyond her call of duty to accommodate our guests and helped me to craft a menu that had a wide variety of entrees to please everyone.  The staff was wonderful in making sure our large parties (20-30 people in each) were comfortable and happy, and I was able to relax and enjoy my guests without worry.  Thank you, Karen and co!Finezza is a wonderful addition to Nashville, and we look forward to many more delicious meals!",Finezza Italian Bistro,6153569398,126 reviews,2013-06-09,"Nashville, TN",/biz/finezza-italian-bistro-nashville,4.0,38,"Washington, DC",Tracy F.
"5404 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Everyone has their short list of quality restaurants that they visit time and time again. These restaurants are probably not revolutionary or surprising but they are tried and true and their food is good. Finezza is on my short list. If we've survived another work week and want pasta with out the any brew-haha, we head to Finezza. Finezza is a very classy, family run restraunt. The lights are low and romantic and the walls are covered with black and white pictures of the Family. They have small intimate tables for dates that can be pulled together to accommodate your rehearsal dinner. I've been here on a date, with friends, and with family. It honestly fits all occasions. The environment is friendly and classy. I've never had to wait more then 10 minutes for a table. The food.First off, as a warning, the bread can ruin your appetite. It's amazing: warm and squishy. They serve it with an olive oil that is delicious, I rarely use the sun dried tomato and regular butter that also accompanies the bread.Most of the meals come with a house or Cesar salad. The house salad is a balsamic vinaigrette that is delicious. The Cesar is good too but I usually order the house salad. I've never heard anyone that I've been with complain about the food. My personal favorites are the capellini pomodora and the white wine clam sauce. The capellini pomodora is very garlicy. If you don't like garlic, I would not recommend ordering it. The clam dish isn't on the menu but I'm able to order it without any problem. My boyfriend has also off menu ordered carbonara and they accommodated him. The boyfriend enjoys the chittara (which can be ordered spicy), the sausage and peppers, and the picata with veal.  Last time, he ordered the picata and I stole a bite.

"5404 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Yesterday was my first visit to Finezza. I have not been to any other Italian joint in Nashville, so this review is based on what i ate yesterday and my experience with Italian food elsewhere(outside US). I have to put it simply, I was blown away!!First thing I look for in Italian food is the quality of sauce, pasta(whichever kind) and the quality of flavors in the food.It has to be fresh and as far as I am concerned, cheese should not be the overpowering flavor(as in the Americanized version of Italian food). We had Red pesto chicken and Spaghetti and meat balls. Spaghetti and meat balls were perfect. They give two large meat balls here compared to the smaller ones you get elsewhere but the taste is fantastic. Spaghetti sauce was simple as it should be and the spaghetti was gr8.The red pesto chicken is a classic. As good as it gets. Absolutely amazing flavor and excellent ingredients. Again, cheese was not the overpowering taste. This is a entree to be ordered here.For people who like wine, Finezza has a big list. Ambiance is romantic, dim lights, lots of parking. Good place for an anniversary dinner or first date. I am a fan and going here again.

We were seated immediately right by the door. It's Christmas time so they had two cute elderly people by the Christmas tree dressed as Mr. and Mrs. Clause. We waited no less than 10 minutes to be greeted by ANYONE, because the entire staff decided to take group pictures right by us with Santa. Not only were they all loud and rude, a few tables were trying to leave and couldn't because of the little ""photoshoot"". They wouldn't stop and let them pass, it was ridiculous. Not only were they a bother, several employees trying to pack into these photos kept banging into my chair. By this time I was extremely angry. Still no one acknowledged us. Another 5 minutes went by after the photo shoot was over and we finally got a waiter. All of our food came out in good time, we enjoy ourselves, had some good wine and took our leftovers home. I began feeling sick in the car when we left. About an hour later I became extremely sick. I was up until 3 AM vomiting up everything I ate, amongst other personal symptoms. So was my fiancé.

"5404 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"I was looking forward to digging into some ""real food"" since the few days before this eating venture I had been consuming a lot of chain restaurants' food. Finezza's did not disappoint. They start out with bringing you a fresh baked loaf of bread with little bowls of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, parm, and butter...and just keep refilling it. This was a huge plus since I honestly think I ate at least one loaf all by my lonesome. For salads we split a caprese which was so fresh (loved the shredded basil instead of huge leaves) and a caesar which might have been one of the tastiest I've had. I ordered the meat lasagna and they were not messing around. There was ground beef, Italian sausage, AND pepperoni in there. It was also covered with homemade marinara and a layer of melted cheese. I was warned it was a good amount of food, which made me think I would be bringing some of it home...but no, I ate every last bite and then proceeded to scoop up the remaining sauce with a slice of bread. I also tried a bite of the Frutti di Mare (shrimp, scallops, salmon, clams with veggies and angel hair pasta) which was very light and flavorful...very seafoody. Another thing I should mention, they make a mean margarita. I know that you shouldn't order a margarita at an Italian restaurant, but I just needed one. It was very tasty and I sipped it down in a few minutes.

"5404 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"We were sadly disappointed. Three close friends and I got dressed up for a nice evening out. We were all looking forward to it. I even looked up reviews, the menu, and wine list beforehand to make sure we were making the right choice for dinner. Our first bottleof wine was an excellent Italian Barbera. Each of our entrees came with soup or salad. I opted for Minestrone soup at our server Emily's suggestion. One of my friends ordered the Caesar salad, another got the house, and another the soup. I figured it was just me that didn't enjoy to soup, but after letting the others try it, they were disappointed as well; especially since our server recommended it. The Caesar and house salads were good. I wished I had ordered one of those, instead. For my entree I chose the Chicken Caprese: chicken breasts served atop angel hair pasta finished w/marinara, fresh basil, and mozzarella. I was so excited, until I started cutting into the chicken. It was well overdone. I had my expectations set so high that it only figures they'd be shot down. My friend to my left ordered the Veal Marsala. I tasted it: overdone and the sauce was too heavy. My other friend ordered the special for the evening, something I considered. It was an alfredo dish with chicken, red onion, peas, sun dried tomatoes tossed in rigatoni. It was bland and there was too much sauce. My friend seated across the table from me ordered the veal piccata. He said it was too lemony. 4 for 4. We figured, why even complain? The second bottle of wine was good, but didn't go well with the entrees we chose. It was priced at $46. After dinner we went next door to the wine shop in search of the first amazing Italian bottle, to find that the $46 bottle went for only $14.99! We felt a large lack of value and do not intend to revisit.",Finezza Italian Bistro,6153569398,3 reviews,2010-11-24,"Nashville, TN",/biz/finezza-italian-bistro-nashville,2.0,38,"Washington, DC",Janelle C.

"1020 Woodland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"3 Crow Bar can be a bit intimidating upon first glance. It's dark. It's smoky... but then you remember where you are and the apprehension goes away. This isn't a biker bar. It's a neighborhood bar that looks rougher than it is. I wouldn't call it a dive bar. A dive bar has horrible things going on in the bathroom, glasses you wouldn't take put your lips on, one type of beer, cheap-ish prices, and no food of which to speak. This isn't a dive bar. The East End rent is way too high for a dive bar.The crown jewel of the bar are the garage doors. On a warm day/evening, once those bad boys go up, it's a game changer. You feel as though you're outside, but you're safely inside if an errant storm cloud blows through. The layout of the bar is also bigger than you might think if you're looking at it from Woodland. Odds are, you'll be able to watch a game but you won't be able to hear it. But, you're not at a sports bar. The game is on for courtesy, not so that you can follow every play. A Jack & Coke will run you $6 and your service will, likely, be disinterested. It is what it is. Even with my expectations set, when the smoke starts rolling in and the garage doors are down, the atmosphere is just intolerable. True enough, smoke gets in your eyes... hair, mouth, nose, and clothes, too. For me, it's too much. 3 Crow is a-ok for when your friends want a place to kick back a couple of drinks when the weather's good. Outside of that, I don't know about it. That said, it's almost always packed to the gills so, clearly, I am in the minority.",3 Crow Bar,6152623345,1642 reviews,2015-06-19,"Nashville, TN",/biz/3-crow-bar-nashville,3.0,140,"Washington, DC",Johnny T.

But we just want to make sure that the Way we were treated doesn't happen to other people we are local. we live in east Nashville but I guarantee you that people from out of town will come to this bar and be treated the same way or maybe worse and it will be a really big disaster so that is all we are saying I hope things do not persist.

"1020 Woodland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"OK, I'm going to rant about it being classified as a ""dive bar"" and then say it's good - you can skip the rant and rest assured it's good or read on.For a dive bar...wait...it's in east nashville.  Don't see how it's a dive for anywhere other than East Nasty.  That's like saying the Waldorf Astoriais a dive for hotels.  This bar is a place where you can go whatever you're dressed like and probably be fine.  Beer is a bit high, booze is a bit high, atmosphere is slightly smoke laden but nothing to write home about.Only a dive if you consider hipsters with twenty thousand dollar credit card limits who pay their tabs and are respectful of others and order locally made craft beers patrons of a dive bar.  It's about as much of a dive bar as McDonalds is a bistro.  I was going to throw in a comment about how many Converse All Stars I saw here but forgot how I was going to tie it in.You want a dive bar?  Go to the former ""Ground Zero"" or Stillwater / Springwater whatever the urinal near the park is called.  (as a note, I have nothing against that place, I call it a urinal as one day I was there, the bathroom had overflowed and someone I think was peeing on the bar) - that is a dive bar.  A dive bar, even if you black out and have no memory of the night you know you were at that bar due to the smell you have when you wake up.Well, Dive bar for Nashville... we don't really have well known dive bars, we have what gentrified people think a dive bar might oughta be.  If you have not seen two old rednecks fighting over something that involved the bartender threatening to cut someone, it's not a dive bar.  Frat boys do not count.anyway, enough about what a dive bar is... this is not a dive unless you want to call all of East Nashville a dive, as they're all here.This place is a nice little bar, you go, you drink, you have fun, you can call it a dive bar if you're afraid to go to a real dive bar, it;s a good little place.Beer is approx $2 more than it should be at a dive bar, the people are nice and well groomed regardless of what they're trying to look like.  The place is more of a scene than a bar, but it's ok.I like it.Go there, enjoy, but trying to claim it as a dive is like trying to claim the Olive Garden is Italian food.The people - all seem nice.  Couple of gay guys, a lesbian and a transsexual, bunch of football fans last time I went.  Couple of out of towners, two bikers in leather yet without so much as one splattered bug carcass on them, bunch of people who dressed like the Mac guy, jeans and t-shirts and a couple of people who looked like they were at a business meeting on Sunday.Fun place, slow service due to - you know, I'm not entirely sure why the service is so slow.  I've watched with 2 bartenders there and a line 9 deep (which was approx 1 out of 6 people) and it moves too slowly.  Seems like a breakdown between pouring and paying.  The pour is fast, but the pay a pain.  I think they might be better served to have a bartender and someone acting as a cashier rather than 2 bartenders doing both.  Not a game killer, but it's annoying when you know it could go faster and it's not.Their Bloody Mary's are supposedly the best in Nashville (I think as judged by the Nashville Scene) - I won't say that, I reserve that for Mad Donnas personally, but they're damn good.  If you need a way to get both your veggies and booze on, this is a good place for it.",3 Crow Bar,6152623345,573 reviews,2010-10-10,"Nashville, TN",/biz/3-crow-bar-nashville,3.0,140,"Washington, DC",Paul K.

In fact, I'm surprised more places in Nashville don't have patios similar to this.I also loved the area. Sort of reminded me of a bit of East Dallas or Lower Greenville - both the area itself and the neighborhood clientele, kind of hipster-y, but not overwhelmingly so, with pockets of really cool shopping/bars/restaurants intermixed with residential areas as well as not-so-great areas somewhat close by. Makes for an eclectic mix. Staff was friendly, but more importantly, PEOPLE were friendly. And the Reuben we shared was ridiculously good. The waitress said they have some sort of steaming contraption that makes the bread all soft and pillow-y and oh-so-amazing. OH SO AMAZING!Another thing I really appreciated about this place is how they do the 2-for-1s. Here they give you a chip with a dollar value on it as oppose to other places that just bring both your beers out at once, which means one of them gets inevitably warm. We also shared our very first Bushwacker - which was pretty darn tasty, just make sure you're in the mood for a milkshake-type drink.But really - hands down definitely the coolest, chillest place we visited.

"1020 Woodland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Oh, how I love thee, 3 Crow Bar.Let's hit the most important topic first: DRINKS! 3 Crow Bar arguably serves the best bushwacker in Nashville (and at a couple dollars less than some places downtown). If you are like me and love any chance to mix your perpetual sweet tooth with a little (lotta) sauce, you'll want to keep ordering them until the machine runs dry, but if you've ever had a bushwacker, you know that is a HORRIBLE idea--which is why I LOVE that they have (still pretty big) small ones.As most people have mentioned, 2-4-1s on Sunday and Wednesday are unbeatable. Even if you just want to stop in for one drink, you get a token for your second drink, which (I'm told) is redeemable at any time. However, I've yet to test this.Now, second most important: Atmosphere. Anyone and everyone could go to 3 Crow and have a good time. There is ample seating indoors with huge windows on the street, so you get the comfort of the outdoors without the noise of being on the back patio. Now, I also love the patio. Don't feel like walking all the way inside to get another brewski? Not a problem with their PATIO BAR. My only beer with the back patio is that it's not very accommodating if you are with a large group of people who like to sit.All in all, the bartenders are friendly. The crowd is fun. Bathrooms are clean. Drinks are delicious.",3 Crow Bar,6152623345,31 reviews,2012-08-30,"Nashville, TN",/biz/3-crow-bar-nashville,4.0,140,"Washington, DC",Madalyn H.
"1020 Woodland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"Living in East Nashville, 3 Crow is definitely a bar that I frequent. I can never get tired of it because it's both familiar and new every time I go. This is mainly because the crowd at 3 Crow is very diverse, and there are many options for seating. I guess it used to be considered a dive bar, but I laugh (or blow air out of my nose a little bit) when I hear it described as that now. This place has become a popular choice for all types of crowds, from locals to Vandy students. 3 Crow has successfully meshed being both a bar and a restaurant. You can choose to sit at a table and be waited on (Caution: This could take a lot of time depending on your server and, of course, how busy the place is. I personally like to order from the bar at my leisure) or hang at the bar or in one of the back patios. One of covered and heated during the winter, and the other is completely open. You can smoke on both patios, except during the cold months smoking is prohibited in the covered patio. The food is actually very good. I recommend the chicken tenders with the potato salad. These tenders are some of the best I've had in Nashville; the crush is soft and crunch at the same time, and the chicken is always really fresh. The potato salad is so good it almost tastes like a dessert. The drinks aren't made especially strong, but they have 2-for-1 specials on Sunday and Wednesday nights. In summary, 3 Crow is a great place to go for basically any occasion. It always depends on the crowd, so if you're looking for a chill night with friends it could potentially happen unless there's a sports game on or if it's some college kid's birthday. Even then, you can usually escape it by moving to the back patios.",3 Crow Bar,6152623345,6 reviews,2013-12-29,"Nashville, TN",/biz/3-crow-bar-nashville,4.0,140,"Washington, DC",Clif D.

"1020 Woodland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"I'd been trying to remember the name of this bar for a good year or so, and it just came back to me today when I saw that a Yelp friend had been posting reviews of establishments in Nashville. She didn't review 3 Crow, though a link to the bar showed up as I was browsing through her reviews.I was in Nashville in Feb. 2009 for less than 48 hours - a friend and I visited from out of town to see a concert that weekend and were in Nashville (and Tennessee, for that matter) from a Friday night through a Sunday morning. We had no idea about which bars to check out, or anything - we didn't exactly do a lot of research before our trip since we were mainly in town just for the concert. I think we found reviews of 3 Crow on our phones and decided to check it out. I'm glad we did!We were there on a Saturday night for only a few hours, but had a great time. As some reviewers have already noted, this is a spot for ""hipsters,"" though don't let that dissuade you from going if you're not one yourself. On the night we were there, it looked like there were a lot of ""indie""/""punk"" kids, so it's interesting that my friend and I so randomly found this place as we mostly listen to ""indie"" music.I had a few draft beers and the (I'm looking at the online menu right now so I can refresh my memory) 5-pepper veggie pizza, which was great. I remember it being more food than I was expecting - I had to take a small portion of it back to our hotel, though I ate it about an hour after we got back. I can't remember what my friend ate, and he didn't drink that night, but he still seemed to enjoy coming here as well.Definitely check this place out for a good crowd (if the previous reviews are any indication; it seems all types of people come in here) and good food.

I think that sorta sums this place up. It's a place you can go and feel happy to be scene in your thick framed glasses and floppy hat, or a place you can plunk down in your jersey and find fellow fans to cheer with. The drinks and food prices are pretty average for the area which is right in the heart of 5 or 6 other restaurants/bars - so even if you decide it's not your 'thing' you can stumble over to something that is. I would save my hungry belly to eat at another yumsville place nearby (see my love of Drifters corndogs) as the food is pretty 'meh' just average old bar food that will serve in a pinch.

"1020 Woodland StNashville, TN 37206",3.5,"From what I've heard, this place will never live up to the Slow Bar.  But I was never part of the Slow Bar era, so this review will contain no Slow Bar bias.3 Crow Bar is only a short walk from my house, and it's a solid neighborhood bar.  It always seems to attract a good size crowd, with a mix of people who are typically East Nashville.  The food is pretty good for this type of place (I like the queso, turkey reuben, and pizza), and they always have excellent beers on tap.  They also have good specials - two for one all day Sunday is my personal favorite, for selfish football reasons.  Plus - and this is a big plus - they have the Bushwhacker.  Have you ever taken a Wendy's Frosty and put a bunch of alcohol in it?  I bet you haven't.  (And if you have, I give you serious credit.  You are some kind of mad drinking genius.)  This thing is probably my favorite drink in all of Nashville (aside from a nice whiskey on the rocks).  It's smooth, strong, sweet, AND gives you a brain freeze (literally and figuratively).  A Bushwhacker alone makes the trip worthwhile.My one complaint is the smoke.  Even with all the garage door windows open, it's like someone just lit a carton of Camel Lights on fire in the middle of the bar.  I'm not a smoker, and smoke doesn't generally bother me, but this is a visible haze that just slowly seeps into you.  People think I smoke four packs a day whenever I go somewhere else after this place.Regardless, 3 Crow Bar is a local favorite of mine.  Good drinks, good crowds, good times.",3 Crow Bar,6152623345,12 reviews,2010-11-12,"Nashville, TN",/biz/3-crow-bar-nashville,4.0,140,"Washington, DC",Zac S.

The music is good and the volume just right. No yelling in this place.So, the one time we ordered food, we had mixed reviews. I had a pizza type roundy looking thing. I can't say no. Kind of like my issue with...I'll save that for another time. So, the meatball pizza was ok at best. The meatballs were cut in half and were about the size of golf balls. Something about the texture seemed off. However, that sauce on the za was delish. Trust me, I'll try another za next time. Def bar style; not traditional. Another person had a wrap. She said it was devine. She ate it all. So, it must have been pretty good. Or, she needed to pad the two seriously tall and stiff martinins she had. Lol.

It was a Monday and the place was not that busy at all yet our waitress took about 20 minutes to even come over to our table.. which was discusting too with cigarette buts, old dirty coasters and ashes all over the table.. didnt appologize at all for the wait or wipe of the table!!Our waitress took literally 15 minutes to even come back over to our table and place our order and even longer to bring our checks after we scarfed down our food anyway because we had to get to work! We figured we would be in there about 30 minutes considering all we had was 2 burgers and 2 waters but no the whole experience was about and hour and a half because of us having to wait so long on our waitress for EVERYTHING because all she wanted to do was talk to the tables full of tattooed guys or hang out by the bar it was rediculous! not to mention she was rude to us the FEW times she did come over to us. I would suggest one of the guy waiters if you have to go here they atleast looked like they were working. I would most definatley not recommend this place to anyone especially if you are trying to just get a quick bit they are SO SLOW! I even talked to a couple friends that night and one of my girl friends said ""exactly! dont go in there for drinks cuz it takes about 30 minutes for them to even acknowledge females and get you a drink"" There is so many other great places in East Nash now I would def never settle for this place again!",3 Crow Bar,6152623345,10 reviews,2012-11-06,"Nashville, TN",/biz/3-crow-bar-nashville,1.0,140,"Washington, DC",Crystal H.

I hate writing bad reviews- in fact, I wouldnt even call this a review, maybe just a reuest to give the staff a little pep-talk about paying attention to details-I had some friends in from out of town, and wanted to take them out to ""one of my favorite bars"", so we walked up to 3 Crow!It smelled like barf as always (oh well...), but it wasnt too busy, so we ordered drinks.They each ordered gin & sodas, and realized once we had paid and walked outside (to escape said barf smell) that they were both vodka sodas. Oh well, not one to waste, we'll just drink 'em. (not a deal breaker, i'm a bartender. it happens.)There was tons of room at the outside bar, so we bellied up and grabbed some menus. The bartender reaaaaaallly ignored us. And it wasn't very busy. and I go in there all of the time...Aaaaand I had an empty pint glass sitting right in front of me.... And she was taking shots with her customers (which, i really could care less- if you can do your job and drink- more power! get it, girl!....but she wasn't)So we flag her down, tell her our order (hummus wrap, black bean burger, black bean burger.), she repeats ""veggie burger"" back to us, typical exchange. We get our food and dig in. yes! we are starving! All is finally well with the world! until my friend gets finished eating her burger and starts asking me what they make the veggie burger out of ...because it was brown and kind of tough...and kind of looked like meat.BECAUSE the bartender had rung in the wrong thing entirely and had given them both beef burgers, TOLD them they were the veggie burgers they had ordered, which they ate, and didnt realize until they saw it on their check. (an error that the bartender didnt even catch when PRINTING the check!)now, i know you're thinking- how on earth did these two vegetarians NOT know that they were eating meat?Well, i have gotten diet coke when i've ordered coke before... I have (obviously) gotten vodka when i ordered gin. But WHY would I think that when I have ordered a veggie burger that you would put BEEF in front of me, and then TELL me it is the veggie burger that I ordered?Also, upon further inspection, the veggie burger comes with similar toppings (avocado, bean & corn salad, etc) as the burger, and was pretty overcooked, so it was kinda dry and brown. ick,.Anyway, we called the bar later and the manager refunded the money.

Speaking of which, they have 2 for 1 everything on Wednesdays, a night usually lacking great specials.The service is friendly though sometimes slow since there are usually only two or three servers on at a time. I recommend getting seated where Jacob or Amy are working, and Brandy is great behind the bar.They served the full menu all day (11-2) and the variety is more than you might expect from a bar. If you eat here you have to try the artichoke dip. It is incomprehensibly delicious, though a bit rough on the breath so make sure you pop a mint before talking to the cutie on the back patio.Another great aspect of this bar is the free wireless (which I'm using right now).

I also I had a craving for ramen. With that said, the ramen is not really ramen. It's more like a beef soup with egg noodles. You're better off making the ramen at home with the $0.20 packets you buy at the store and adding in your choice of meat. It's too oily and lack favor. And at $9 a bowl... Definitely not worth it. The Korean tacos, however, were quite tasty and being 2 for $6 or 3 for $9 it's affordable and very filling. Lastly, we got the Thai tea boba and it was decent at best but at nearly $5 a cup... again, not worth it. I would say the biggest takeaway here (and biggest disappointment) is the ramen.

Speaking of prices, they are a bit higher than I'm used to. This is likely due to the appeal of sushi as ""something different"" and they do have a few items that are likely more expensive to carry versus your run-of-the-mill sushi place.

They put the sushi in these little to-go boats lined with wax paper and covered with a cardboard lid/sleeve. The little rolls sometimes get a little stuck to the wax paper, but whenever I receive my sushi, it's always cold, tastes fresh, and didn't get thrown all over the place. SPILL WARNING: However, they put soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger in little to-go cups wrapped in plastic wrap. Due to driving around, the soy sauce gets spilled all over inside that wrap. Delivery miso also gets spilled all over, too. I feel that Gogo Sushi at least tries to combat this problem by wrapping everything in plastic wrap- so thank you for that! I just think the drivers don't care about the state the food's in when they deliver...too bad. The teas arrive fine because they have a sealed lid.All in all, I think it's a great place and not too expensive.

At this point, I've probably tried 9 or 10 different sushi places in Nashville and GoGo stands out as by far the worst.

I mistakenly thought bubble tea couldn't be messed up, and hey, I'm desperate! After Fat Straw closed, it's been virtually impossible to find decent bubble tea in Nashville. I wish I could forget the 2 times I've had bubble tea from here. Both times I was served a lukewarm, powdery mess, with CRUNCHY, undercooked boba.

We also ordered three bubble tea drinks. The rolls were less than mediocre. I don't know if they were having an off day or what but the rice was just horrible. Undercooked and still crunchy. I'm Asian... I know my rice... And if you're gonna serve sushi you at least have to get the rice part right. All the fillings and toppings don't matter if the rice is gross. The guys I came with enjoyed the different types of sushi with different flavors and toppings but I don't think we'll be back. I'm super disappointed because this would have been a great place that was close by for lunch. The boba was good but the tea I ordered didn't taste the way it was supposed to.

I went into GoGo Sushi to simply ask for ramen and bubble tea, asking them if there was soy in the ingredients (you'd be surprised how often soy will sneak into ingredients, especially soy lechitin, so I need to ask). First I asked for ramen, and the guy working said, ""no."" Then, the girl working with him said, ""Yes there is!"" Thank god she corrected him. So I go on to ask, ""Is there soy in the bubble tea?"" He shrugs and says, ""I don't know. I guess not. But I'm not an expert."" Well, I'm not a customer! Thanks for not helping - I used to be a super supportive customer, but since they're not supportive of my dietary restrictions (I don't even care if I have to change up what I order, just tell me what I can order!) then I will go elsewhere!",GoGo Sushi,6158917690,11 reviews,2015-03-30,"Nashville, TN",/biz/gogo-sushi-nashville,1.0,69,"Washington, DC",Kiki C.

When someone asks me what my favorite sushi in town is, I have a hard time answering because there's a bunch of places I like. Overall, Gogo Sushi is one of my favorites and definitely my favorite concept of them all! The Titan roll is my favorite specialty roll. The soy wrap is outstanding, it's got a nice crunch to it and is packed with flavor! You can't go wrong with any of their specialty rolls, but the Build-Your-Own roll is really where it's at. Today, my fiance created one that went like this: seaweed wrap, brown rice, crawfish, mango, pineapple, cucumber, and jalapeno mayo. Honestly, when she ordered it I cringed. It didn't sound like it would work to me. But it did!! It was my favorite of all 4 rolls we got. Another unique combo we ordered: seaweed wrap, brown rice, spicy salmon, BACON, asparagus, avocado, baby spinach, and wasabi mayo. Crazy, but it worked so well and was unlike any sushi I've ever had. I love how you order on a touch screen too. It's kind of like Which Wich, without the bags and markers. You can take your time ordering and it's super simple.

One, I absolutely hate that my first review is a negative one, but my experience at Gogo prompted me to create an account and write this. Two, I hate writing bad reviews. It makes me sad.That being said, here I go with my sad review. I did thorough research on this place on Yelp before I visited. I read every review and took most with a grain of salt. You can't please everyone. I knew going in that I should not expect traditional sushi. I had read, though, that service was quick. Because of work, I get exactly 1 hour for lunch, so my husband and I frequent restaurants close to my office. Today, we tried Gogo. The place wasn't packed; maybe 10 people inside. We ordered BYO rolls with chicken and a bubble tea. We took our seat, and waited. And waited. With 20 minutes left before I had to be seated at my desk at work, they called the order after ours. I went up and asked if they forgot our order. Turns out they were out of chicken and had to grill some more. I completely understand that, but it would have been nice for and update on the food. If I had known, we would have changed our order to something faster.We got our food (changed it to a to-go order) and ran out of there. I ate lunch at my desk. In all, it took 30 minutes to get my bubble tea and 40 minutes for our sushi. It was a sad experience.

"2057 Scarritt PlNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"We decided to give it a try for lunch. I applaud the concept of customized sushi in a fast food setting, as this is a chain often found at airport terminals. The place had only 5-6 other customers when we walked in and the food turned out within 5-10 minutes of us ordering at the computer terminal. However, this was one of my worst Japanese meals in Nashville in recent years.Each of us got either raw salmon, tuna or eel in our rolls along with various non-meat addition. Unfortunately, the slivers of fish were so thin that you had to look hard to find it. I'd say they were 1-2mm thin. The avocado was very tough and tasteless, i.e. unripe, so was the mango that one of us added. The ""fried tempura crunchies"" turned out to be ""rice crispies"". One of our group added Unagi sauce on top which was the only salvation to an otherwise bland sushi.For the price that we paid on each roll, it was not worth it. Walk down 21st for 5 more minutes and the sushi there is a lot better for the same price of not less. Having lived in Nashville for 10 years, we are regulars to samurai sushi, Ken's sushi and Sonobana.

"2057 Scarritt PlNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"Overall: No frills, just quick & easy sushi.Food/Drinks: It's one of those sushi places that doesn't do a whole lot with raw fish... you know the restaurants that use beef & chicken? We bought two from the menu and made one ourselves. I don't think the sushi is bad at all, it's just nothing all that special. The mushroom roll had copious amounts of rice and wasn't all that flavorful, but the spicy salmon was interesting enough to order a second time. I think this would be a good option if you wanted to get sushi with friends who don't eat sushi.Atmosphere/Service: There wasn't anything wrong in this department per se... it was very clean and organized (borderline sterile.) But there wasn't anything particularly appealing about it. You place your order at a computer screen and move down the counter. The only issue I see with the computer is that you can't make changes to the menu options and the employees take whatever alterations you have verbally. This worked completely fine the night i was there because the place was empty, not thinking it will once it's busier. It feels like more of a place to grab a quick lunch, not necessarily a leisurely dinner.Cost: The specialty rolls range from $6 - $9; the ""build your own"" can add up fast, but it really depends what you put on it. Edamame is about $1.50. Sake was expensive-ish, I think about $12 for a bottle.Tip: Gogo uses a company that delivers anywhere in Nashville!

They don't have a lot of options as far as fish goes (salmon, spicy salmon, tuna, spicy tuna), but I think they're adding more soon. When you come in, you order on a screen - you can have one of their rolls (a couple of standard rolls, a couple of more creative ones) or build your own. I built my own with salmon and some veggies - avocado, cucumber, daikon. Then you choose sauces and things; the wasabi mayo was good. I was worried that the ordering on a screen deal would result in a strangely impersonal experience, but once you get to the assembly line, the chefs chat with you and it's not weird at all.They'll be adding sake and beer soon, but for now it's tea and soft drinks, also a few imported japanese sodas (the ones with the ball floating around in the bottle). In general it's a great place to scratch your sushi itch, but don't expect anything fancy. The fish seemed fresh and was very tasty.

I kind of agree with the other poster's comment about the build-your-own menu being overwhelming but, as this is 21st in Nashville and not 52nd and Lex at lunch rush hour, I can take my time and it works out just fine.",GoGo Sushi,6158917690,8 reviews,2013-08-26,"Nashville, TN",/biz/gogo-sushi-nashville,5.0,69,"Washington, DC",Leslie Z.
"2057 Scarritt PlNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"Found this sushi place the other day when driving around Downtown Nashville. Unlike anything else I have ever seen before. There is a large menu board that shows some of the rolls that they offer as well as the ingredients that they offer for the Build Your Own Roll. My hubs and I picked what we wanted and decided to order. Surprisingly, you punch your order in a little POS station that is right next to the menu board. This is great for me, because I can be certain that I put in what I want and I have a chance to catch a mistake. And, I was pleasantly surprised by the appearance of Bubble Tea in Nashville! I have lived in Middle Tenn for just about 2 years and sadly had to give that up when I moved from Central Florida.  The only reason that I docked a star was because of the staff. The young lady that was working was friendly, mildly engaging and conversational. I enjoyed her plenty. The young man, on the other hand looked disinterested and barely made eye contact. Never even got a name of either. I guess this is the downside with placing your own order, lack of human intereaction = lack of customer service. The food was tasty and the drinks were spot on. They have ramune soda's too. I would likely go again, but I would just expect less from the staff.

"2057 Scarritt PlNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"Great concept, fresh ingredients, and cool designs. You start by ordering at a kiosk, which is great for an introvert like myself... They have side items to choose from, unique Asian drinks, beer, and Sake. Serving bubble tea soon as well. Sushi is ready in minutes, and the proportion is huge for the price. Their roll is comparable to almost two at sit down places for less the price. Can't really complain if your roll doesn't taste amazing, since you're the one picking what's in it! Haha. They provide fresh, tasty ingredients...it's up to you build a masterpiece. First roll I made was good, then I tried a different combination and it was amazing! Or try one of their suggested rolls which are already great. They usually have the game on, or some good music...plus you can even buy some artwork from the gallery on the wall.

When we visited, a trio was singing on stage and sang some wonderful country tunes. When I walked upstairs, I was surprised to see that the place was jammed packed! This was more of the ""nightclub"" version of the place. Huge outdoor windows offered a lot of fresh air. Whether or not you go upstairs or down, the beers are pretty reasonable. A Coors Light goes for about $6. One of the highlights of this trip was being able to meet MTV star, CT. I don't know if he worked there or not, but I saw him behind the bar and asked him to take a picture. I'm a huge fan of the shows he's on and love that guy in general.

The food always takes forever, and is lackluster - except for the portion sizes, which run to the 'huge' size. With the location, it's not a bad place to come before a Predators game, and if you like a highly audience-focused, participatory band, Rippy's usually picks ones of that style.

"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Downtown Nashville is an awesome place for live music, but surprisingly there aren't just too many barbecue joints to pick from. Jack's has a prominent place on Broadway (Nashville's main drag), and although their 'que is delicious, the line usually stretches halfway to the Cumberland River. I found Rippy's across the street and hoped it would be good, too. Fingers crossed.Not to be outdone, Rippy's had live music going tonight. The old 90s country was actually really good. Nashville is the kind of city where it's not at all unusual to see folks two-stepping in the middle of a restaurant. All in all, this place had a really pleasant atmosphere.I ordered a Half Portion Dinner (6 bones) of Rippy's Signature Ribs. The ribs come with two sides, so I picked potato salad and onion rings. The menu didn't specify whether the ribs were wet or dry, but I hoped for the latter.The potato salad was nice and creamy. It had a great flavor, and I thoroughly enjoyed the crunch from the pickles, etc. I also liked that the mustard base wasn't overpowering. The onion rings looked fresh rather than frozen. They had a great batter and were fried nice and golden. This was an excellent pick for a side dish.Much to my delight, the ribs came with a dry rub. I was able to cut them apart with minimal effort, suggesting that they were slightly overdone. They had a great smoke level, which matched perfectly with the evident smoke ring. My main issue with the ribs was the inconsistency. The first bite was fairly spicy, coupled with just a touch of sweetness. It was also decently tender. Other bites were more bland and weren't spicy at all, and the meat nearest the center was a bit dry. I was surprised to find so many differences in only seven inches of meat.Rippy's wasn't the best barbecue I've ever had, but it was certainly passable. I'd go back for the drinks and music, although I'd likely order a burger instead.",Rippy’s,6152447477,541 reviews,2014-07-30,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rippys-nashville,3.0,372,"Washington, DC",Jared K.

The higher up you go, the crazier and more crowded it gets, and the better the bands get. We started on the lowest level having drinks at a table where it was less crowded. The band was fine but the entertainment value came more from how hammered the lead singer was.

Eventually they turned her mic off and she still continued to sing into it.

I can tell you that all the people eating inside are tourists that do not know there's much better BBQ options around town.One of the only pluses about the place is the large, second story patio that overlooks the street below.

"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Stopped in here twice this weekend during my cousins bachelorette party. It was our last stop on our bar hop Saturday night. Good crowd and had a decent band playing.Then we stopped by for mid-afternoon drinks on Sunday. It was gorgeous out so we hit the second floor which is completely open but still has a roof which was AWESOME! The open layout allowed for a warm breeze and let us be outside without baking in the sun. The acoustic trio was really good. I have a feeling this bar gets a lot of the better gigs due to it's size.Being from the Tri-state area, we were impressed at the drink prices being much more reasonable than NYC.Also the male wait staff wear a great t-shirt.

"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,For being Nashville for the first time I thought I would have some good BBQ I've hade better in Detroit. Gave you 2 sauces and they were both ok and did not see much of a difference other than one was a little more spicy. The ribs wee good with the dry rub but the pulls chicken was dry. The slaw was bland but the beans were good and only if you like spicy. I figure this is the type of food you get in a tourist town.  I guess you have to go off the beaten path to find the good stuff.

"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Us tourists stopped by here on a tip from a local friend, since our desired spot was packed.  We were really just in the mood for good BBQ, and this happened to be nearby.  I'll just start off by saying this isn't really a dinner restaurant.  It's more of a bar that serves food.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's not quite what we had in mind.  The drinks were fine, but we weren't super thrilled with the quality of the BBQ food.  Between us, we had pulled pork and pulled chicken sandwiches w/ french fries and slaw sides.  The food was really nothing to write home about, even though they provided BBQ Sauce to coat it with.  The service was a tad off; we had to wait quite a while for our bill (couldn't find our waiter).  I didn't know places still served RC Cola!I'm not really gonna write much about the live band or the local beers, you can find these in almost every building on the street.  Not sure I would come back, given some of the other options in the area.",Rippy’s,6152447477,394 reviews,2013-11-12,"Escondido, CA",/biz/rippys-nashville,3.0,372,"Washington, DC",Robert J.

"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"We were in Nashville for the Final Four and stumbled upon this place because the music pouring out of the upstairs outdoor stage was so good. We waited about 5 minutes for a table (if) and had a super great server. We both ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries and onion rings so we could share. The sandwiches were great, but the sauce was what made it exceptional! The fries and onion rings were also hot and tasty. The band playing was amazing, and in the 2 hours we were there never took a break! We did go downstairs at one point and the 2 different bands playing inside were just as good - one in the bar area and one in the restaurant area. I have to say, as a musician, I did not hear one bad band or performer in my 5 days in Nashville. Not even mediocre. Everyone in this town can play! And sing!We actually like this place so much we went back 2 days later. After looking over the menu we stuck with the pulled pork with fries and onion rings. Why mess with perfection? The last night there we went to Tootsie's Orchid Lounge, but stood on their outside patio and listened to the band at Rippy's...kind of silently wishing we had gone there instead.

There are TVs everywhere to catch sports on. My 3 friends all got pulled pork or chicken sandwiches that were good and filling. I opted to do something different and got the pork loin sandwich instead, which I was very happy with. The sauce that comes with it tastes like a dry rub in liquid form. It's very peppery and went so well with the sandwich when I mixed with a little extra BBQ sauce. The service was very slow though and our waiter was not interested in good service in the slightest. Because the bar is so big, it can get so loud. We were there on a Bridgestone concert night, so the local radio station was hosting a live party there.

The curly fries were way too spicy for the wife.I ordered the half slab of ribs with potato salad and baked beens. The potato salad tasted like it was a pre-prepared commercial product, the beens tasted like they opened a can then heated them up.The ribs were an utter disappointment, they were way over cooked, had no smoke flavor, and no taste from the dry rub. The ribs tasted like they were made the day before and heated up in a steam table, which washed away any smoke or dry rub flavors.The server was slow, she never even came over to see how everything was, I had to ask for the check.

The food was average, not horrible, but underwhelming. I only ate about a third of my meal and took the rest to go--but never ate the leftovers because....Within two hours my husband and I were both violently sick with food poisoning. We were up all night with cramps, diarrhea and vomiting. This is the worst food poisoning I've ever had. I called the restaurant and asked to speak to the manager but when the girl asked why, and I told her it was regarding food poisoning she told me the manager was in a meeting. At 12?

Being from Massachusetts we don't have many good BBQ places to choose from. After getting to Nashville we decided to check Rippys out. From the outside it looked and sounded like they had a nice vibrant yet relaxing atmosphere. As we walked in we were greeted very nicely and were told we could sit wherever we liked. Immediately after we sat down the waitress came to our table to take our drink order. Following that we order food. My girlfriend order the pulled chicken sandwich and I ordered the pulled pork platter. The chick was perfectly smoky and tender and the pork was also perfectly smoky. Rippys does not add too much BBQ sauce to the dishes, instead they give you two options of sauce in the table, spicy and mild, both are absolutely amazing!!!!!!! Even if you decided not to eat here the atmosphere was amazing, where else can you go at any time of the day and be serenaded by music.

"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Ok, new rule at Rippy's. You must sit at your table and not go to the bar to order a beer no matter how bad the service is. You need to wait patiently at your table. Waiter chewed me out for getting drinks at the bar when he wasn't around. They even called the manager and bouncer over when I told them they had to be kidding. I am a local resident so I wasn't intimidated based on past trips to this bar. So, no issue here, I will drink at the new Acme bar at the end of the strip.

"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"As I walked into Rippy's, the bouncer asked me if my breasts were real and actually reached out and touched them.I immediately asked to talk to the manager of Rippy's, as this is a completely inappropriate way to treat a customer. I assumed he would be immediately disciplined, as an employee who sexually harasses customers would probably be considered a legal liability by most sane humans.I calmly explained the situation to the general manager and recreated what he did to me, poking her chest in the same matter in which he touched me so that she understood the complete inappropriateness of the situation.She immediately exploded, yelling at me, calling me aggressive and attempting to deflect blame from the bouncer and on to me. I wasn't even raising my voice as I spoke to her.She made no effort whatsoever to apologize for the fact that I was sexually harassed. She did not ask the bouncer to apologize. She did not suggest that any action would be taken against the bouncer.This went beyond the realm of bad experience; I am honestly horrified that there are establishments in this world where this wouldn't result in an immediate termination of employment.My email to the owner of Rippy's outlining the situation also was not returned.",Rippy’s,6152447477,2 reviews,2013-10-06,"Taylor, MI",/biz/rippys-nashville,1.0,372,"Washington, DC",Sdfsdf D.

"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Stopped in at Rippy's with 6 friends mid-evening for some grub.  The food wasn't the best I have ever had, but it was reasonably priced, pretty tasty, and convenient.  I got the feeling that most people who were eating at Rippy's were there because it was in the middle of the bar scene and it was easy - not because the food was 5-star.  We were promptly seated and brought drinks. Our orders were taken quickly, and the food probably took 20 minutes or so to come out - not bad when you have a large group, there is loud live music being played, and the place is packed. The chicken fingers could have been skipped, and the cheese fries could have used about 10 times more cheese to actually be classified as cheese fries. But the pork loin melt with cheese on texas toast was A-OK in my book.  We added some barbecue sauce and it was the tastiest thing I tried at Rippy's.  The beans were extra flavorful, with some southern seasonings and a spicy kick to them.  For two meals, an appetizer, and two beers, we spent around $35 - not too shabby!If I were actually going to plan a nice meal in Nashville, I would NOT go anywhere near Rippy's.

The menu was typical for a BBQ location, a little on the short side though.

You GOT to have corn-cakes with EVERY meal in the South. You just DO. Uh-no NO, no protest. Now, to me, pulled pork and pulled chicken are slathered in a thick bbq-ish sauce that is tangy and hot (like me) and juicy. Not at all the case here, which was a shame. Dry ass chicken on my humiliated iceberg lettuce. Sigh. At least it was a good vehicle for some spicy hot sauce that I used most liberally. The corn cakes were...pancakes. Odd, for a lunch side - but these were the saving grace of the meal; crispy edges, sweet corn flavor, however slightly rubbery, but also good for the saucin.' Meal done, I felt it time for a coffee, make it Irish and the waitress timidly brought it to me, stating ""it's nothing fancy"" - to which I replied, that's fine with me, I'm not a fancy kinda Girl!

"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"I was a little disappointing with Rippy's to say the least.  The atmosphere was amazing I love the open bar and the roof top dining. I think our mistake was coming here excepting  a nice sit down meal. Rippy's is great for after work drinks or a quick dinner, but if your coming in from out of town and want to enjoy a nice meal I would suggest another place. The plastic cups and Paper plates were a huge turnoff epically for the price we paidThe Food was ok we had the nachos with pulled chicken, I believe they would have been better if they weren't served Luke warm. I had the 1/2 rack of ribs, and usually I am not a fan of dry bbq or bbq where you have to apply your own sauce but these were good. The meat was tender and smokey and fell right off the bone. The sweet tea could have been better.  My overall opinion is that the food was tasty and the atmosphere great but that does not equal a good restaurant. I would def try if your in downtown Nashville its a def must experience.

"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"So finding a place to take my out of town guests for some BBQ on New Year's Day was a bit of a challenge.  I wanted to try Jack's on Trinity Lane but when we got there it was a ghost town...closed.  So off to Broadway we went only to find that Jack's downtown was....closed.  DOH!  Rippy's was open and there was music playing and a throng of people milling about so what the hell, let's give it a try.We put our name on the wait list and got a buzzer.  Then I went to the bar to try and score an immediate diet Coke.  I didn't actually score any though because the bar was pretty slammed and the kiddos working the bar were ignoring me pretty thoroughly.  But the buzzer went off right when my patience was about to fly out the window so we were all good.  The buzzer talks too, by the way.  So we were seated in the main dining area which was perfect for music listening and people watching.  We all ordered the pulled pork sandwich with onion rings.  The onion rings were on POINT!  Perfectly crispy and fried - we all loved them enough to eat every bite.  The pulled pork though - MEEEEEEHHHHHH!  What the hell?  Why did it have to be dry and devoid of all smoky flavor?  Even the sauce, which was decent, didn't help.  And that spicy sauce was not so spicy, but definitely better than the sweet (which tasted like KC Masterpiece if you ask me).  I was disappointed, not so much for me because I have plenty of time to suss out perfect BBQ but for my friends from Michigan who are going to think this is representative of TN BBQ.  Oh well, at least we could watch the games and people watch on lower Broad.  That made up for it.  Our waitress was nice and she kept all of our drinks filled at all times.  And the Bloody Mary I ended up ordering was decent so there's that.The place does have a lot of space, a lot of TVs, and apparently a rooftop area which looks like it would be tons of fun during games and during nice weather.  So I think I'll definitely be back before a show or before a night of honky tonkin.  But I think I'll continue my search for the best BBQ in Nashville because this just isn't it.",Rippy’s,6152447477,1027 reviews,2011-01-03,"Nashville, TN",/biz/rippys-nashville,3.0,372,"Washington, DC",Nickie G.

Our waiter was excellent, just materializing with a fresh Coke for me everytime mine got a little low, and the staff as a whole seemed on top of things, even if that meant carrying a dozen trays of bbq upstairs in a feat of phsyics I'm still not sure I understand. The food was very good southern barbecue, but the highlight for sure was the music. Two first floor rooms allow for multiple acts to perform and the one that we sat by was a male/female duo of early 20's country performers doing well by Johnny & June with their classic country covers.

No vegetarian option here aside from fried food ... that being said, the onion rings were some of the biggest and thickest I've ever had, but unfortunately they were overcooked. The ranch dressing that came with them was tasty. I'm very picky on good ranch dressing. My hubby had the pulled pork and said it was completely dry. He felt bad that there weren't any vegetarian-friendly options so he gave me his side of slaw. I love coleslaw and am really sad to say this is the worst we've ever tasted. It was so sour and bitter.

"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"My colleagues and I had a craving for BBQ on a Tuesday night, which was unfortunate because Jack's was closed. However, Rippy's did come to the rescue, since they were open (and rocking with live music). In addition, they had outdoor seating with a roof deck, which is definitely a plus, especially if you consider how the restaurant is situated overlooking Broadway and the Sommet Center.When we walked into Rippy's, the first thing we did was try to find the staircase leading to the roofdeck. If there was a closer, easier path to the roofdeck, we didn't find it; instead, we walked across the restaurant, crossing the stage in front of performers to reach the staircase.The menu was limited, but this is expected for a place that specializes in BBQ. I thought the portion size was decent, though the presentation of wax paper in basket does need work. At least I got wetnaps.The service left much to be desired. We were only one of two other parties sitting upstairs, and yet no one seemed entirely interested in helping us out whenever we needed refills. Splitting checks was also a little adventure, despite our best efforts to explain what we needed.The next week, we also craved BBQ, but held out until later in the week so we could go to Jack's.I guess the takeaway here is that if you want live music and drinks first, then Rippy's is a good spot.

"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"I guess I liked it more than others...!  Part of that might have been driven by the fact that I was STARVING and hadn't eaten a proper meal in nearly 24 hours, but I thought the food was pretty good....and the upstairs patio was awesome.I was in Nashville for a wedding, and my friend advised us to go to Rippy's for lunch.  The restaurant/bar has two floors - the downstairs being the darker, entirely indoor portion; the upstairs is partially covered but mostly an open patio with tons of seating.  Given the great weather that we had, it was nice to sit outdoors and enjoy the sun. (Also, for my NY friends, they could also smoke at the table.)But, wow, we ate a lot.  I think we may have scared the waitress.  Between the six of us, we ordered 2 orders of ribs, 2 orders of hot wings, 1 order of pulled pork, 1 order of onion rings and 1 order of chicken fingers.  Oh, and 2 salads for good measure (I didn't sanction that).  And we devoured it all - the ribs are more of a dry rub as opposed to the overly saucy ones you might find in other places (though there's plenty of sauce for you to add).  I quite enjoyed the pulled pork.  And then we topped off the meal with pecan pie and ice cream.  The real clincher was the service - our waitress was working just about every table upstairs and was fast and attentive.  She had refills of sweet tea, coffee, fresh beers, whatever we needed before we even asked.  All this plus beers and coffee (gotta have the uppers and downers!) was $27 per person.",Rippy’s,6152447477,1078 reviews,2007-11-16,"San Francisco, CA",/biz/rippys-nashville,4.0,372,"Washington, DC",Wendy L.

"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"HEADLINE: Granted, I'm not from around these parts, but this place did not appeal on many fronts. In town for business and the team wanted BBQ. Now, I have no idea why they wanted BBQ in Nashville ... it ain't known for it exactly, if at all ... this ain't Chicago or Austin ... but we decided to ask the hotel guys where they thought the best BBQ was in town. The answer coming back was Jack's and Rippy's. When we pressed further about which one was the best, we were told that word-of-mouth was better for Jack's, but they didn't have table service per se ... ""You get in a line, and place your order, and go find a table"" we were told. We decided we didn't want to do that so we decided to go here ... stupid us. We arrive to hear a string duo playing music waaaayyyy too loudly for the size of the environs. We asked to be seated way in the back where there appeared to be an auxiliary bar with a bunch of big screen TV's. At least it was quiet(er) and the only other patrons dining with us back there were a table of five 20-somethings with a very small baby with them ... more on that later. We order up ... two rib orders, one pulled pork and, me, I went for the sliced smoked pork loin ... everyone save one substituted their ""corn cakes"" for the ginormous onion rings we saw on the way in. I asked what beer they had on tap ... answer ... none ... all bottled beers only ... one star gone right here ... now, they do have a great selection of bottled beers, but I'm just a draft beer snob I guess ... One of us orders a glass of cab ... now, that's just stupid to do in a joint like this, but he goes ahead anyways ... sure enough it comes out in a 7 oz. plastic beer cup. One star should have been removed right then and there, but who orders a Cabernet at a place like this?????? ... plastic cup deserved!!!  Keep the star.Our dinners show up in plastic trays with parchment paper underneath all the offerings ... decent portions of meat but the sides of cole slaw, baked beans and sauce, each in their respective small plastic containers, were exceedingly small. Consensus on the ribs by the others was 'they were OK but lacking moisture', as was the pulled pork. My smoked pork loin slices were dry as a bone and, quite honestly, flavorless. They had none of the requisite 'smoke ring' effect needed for truly exceptional smoked meat.  We all noted at the end of dinner that we went through the entire squeeze bottle of BBQ sauce ... a hint right there of how moisture-less the meats were.Further, as I continued to apply sauce, the paper in the tray began to shred under the weight of the liquid ... poor concept I must say. Between the lack of flavor of the smoked pork and the gross sauce-logged paper getting intertwined with my meal ... two stars ejected.Now, I'm not from around these parts, but the sauce, which BTW should be the hallmark of any BBQ joint, was just mediocre.  Certainly a vinegar base, but nothing nuanced about it at all and thin.  I would have even preferred being bowled over by too much heat just to perk up my taste buds ... this simply didn't excite anything at all.  Pretty mundane across all the taste buds.The best things on the plate, it turned out, were the o-rings and the 3 oz. of baked beans which had a nice kick to them thanks to what I believe were some jalapenos ... very, very good ... unfortunately, we didn't come here for baked beans and o-rings. The football games on the TV's were infinitely more entertaining than the duo playing music ... their program was highlighted by them playing ""Smoke on the Water"" ....... with two banjos .... ahem ..... Seeing pecan pie on the menu for dessert ... we ordered up two slices to share, and found it to be one of the WORST pecan pies ever encountered.  Simply bad ... no flavor or texture at all ... maybe throwing some pecans into the pie filling next time would help, guys.Finally, to add salt to the festering wound of a dining experience this evening turned out to be, the 20-somethings next to us decided it would be 'hysterical' to start tossing a soiled baby diaper at each other around their table. They seemed to think this was simply hilarious. Now, again, I'm not from around these parts, but ... just not funny no matter how drunk you are, guys. Can't wait to see how the kid turns out years from now. Next time I want BBQ in Nashville, I'll suck it up and stand in line ....... across the street at Jack's.  But, really, why seek out BBQ in Nashville in the first place???????",Rippy’s,6152447477,114 reviews,2009-11-12,"San Jose, CA",/biz/rippys-nashville,2.0,372,"Washington, DC",Ned H.

"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"The entire experience was horrible. The waitress first reprimanded us for not seeing the hostess. We were then given paper menus that listed some of their overpriced items twice. The waitress was incomprehensible, and also did not understand anything we had to say to her. Finally, we ordered the ribs with baked beans and corn cakes. The waitress came back TWO minutes later with a luke warm half rack of ribs and some unidentifiable piece of clobbered together corn meal. When I tried the first piece of the ribs, I thought I was going to pass out from the stink that spread throughout my olfactory system. The swinish, rotten taste was revolting enough for me to stop eating the ribs after a minute. I really think that the ribs were just microwaved and sat around there for a while prior. Even the corn cakes were just put in the microwave, and the little butter pack tasted rancid and came half melted. I wouldn't be surprised if the dim witted waitress put the butter pack into the microwave as well, with the wrapping around it. We managed to return the ribs and left the place without giving them a cent of our money.

So that's exactly what we did. It was a great place to go for dinner; lots of tables, goood food. Live music, too, although I would choose some of the other honky tonks for nightlife. Overall, RIppy's is a great place to stop for dinner. 5 stars for pulled pork.",Rippy’s,6152447477,43 reviews,2008-03-31,"Potomac Falls, VA",/biz/rippys-nashville,5.0,372,"Washington, DC",Adrienne M.
"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"The BBQ on my visit to Rippy's ranged from bleh to meh ~ 2.5 stars leaning ever so gently towards 3. The pulled chicken on my sandwich was adequately cooked, but so moist that the bottom bun disintegrated. The only sauce was a vinegary and somewhat watery solution in a plastic squeeze bottle, but it was alright, I guess. The beans were quite zippy and worth eating, but the french fries seemed like they may have sat under a lamp for a little while or something. Eh, I wouldn't be afraid to eat here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way... unless the live music act warranted it!",Rippy’s,6152447477,206 reviews,2010-02-01,"Athens, GA",/biz/rippys-nashville,2.0,372,"Washington, DC",Emily T.

"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"We stumbled upon this place because Jack's was closed. It was Tuesday night and this place was empty. We ordered three items:$22 for a rack of ribs$12 for fried catfish$12 for pulled porkThey all came with a tiny styrofoam cup of baked beans (very sweet), and another cup of cole slaw. The ribs were very dry, the pulled pork was dry. The corn cakes were cold. I don't know if it was because it was Tuesday that the food was sub-par. I can see how this place can be packed during hockey games... with two large bars and many TVs as well as a stage for a live band. The service was good, but there's not much to say about the food. If you do want to come here for food, I'd recommend the catfish. It was excellent. As for the other bbq items, I'd shy away from those.",Rippy’s,6152447477,22 reviews,2009-01-09,"Alhambra, CA",/biz/rippys-nashville,2.0,372,"Washington, DC",Gina H.

"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Rippy's is a corner bar that extends to the building next door and has a upstairs patio.  I went there twice when I was in Nashville, due to the proximity to the Nashville Convention Center and I had to get in, eat, and get out.    They have a wide selection of beers and spirits as well as a menu that is okay.  I mean, I've had better BBQ pulled pork sandwiches elsewhere.    The pork was very dry but they did have BBQ sauce at the table so you could put as much as you want on it.  But the pork itself wasn't that flavorful.  They have lunch specials which are a good deal, if you are looking for a good deal.  My pulled pork sandwich came with fries and some gnarly cole slaw  for $5.95, which isn't that bad, if you think about it.    If you want value, this is the place to go to.  Based on the sandwich that I ate, I wouldn't come back though.",Rippy’s,6152447477,117 reviews,2006-09-16,"Bellevue, WA",/biz/rippys-nashville,3.0,372,"Washington, DC",Herb C.
"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Easy lunch spot. Last Friday I had friends in from out of town and we were planning to go to Jack's BBQ on Broadway. Unfortunately we got there around 12:30 and the line was already out the door and down the sidewalk. Rather than stand there in the heat we decided to look at a menu of the place with the roof top seating, Rippys. We were able to sit anywhere...the upper rooftop was terrific! Great people watching. I had the pulled pork sandwich w/ baked beans. Had to ask the waiter for sweet BBQ sauce rather than the spicy which was already on the table. My friend had pulled chicken and pork sandwiches too. Everyone was happy with the choice and we were out of there within an hour. I enjoy Jack's but would definitely go back to Rippy's!",Rippy’s,6152447477,62 reviews,2010-10-23,"Shawnee Mission, KS",/biz/rippys-nashville,4.0,372,"Washington, DC",Anne M.
"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Best BBQ i've ever had. Their bbq sauce is a delicious vinegar sauce and it compliments their spicy bbq so perfectly.I got the half rack of ribs and they were soooo delicious. They have a dry rub and they must smoke the ribs so they fall off the bone. Squirt it with a little of their special bbq sauce and it was the best ribs i've ever had. And i've had some good ribs.But you know your at an unbelievable bbq place when the baked beans are delicious. They were the best beans i've ever had. I also had some fries and they give you a version of their cornbread and its in pancake form... but its perfect for the heat you get when you eat the ribs.My friends got the pulled pork sandwich and they seemed to enjoy it very much as well. I had a bite with the sauce and it was money as well. Very great place...And try the local beer, Yazoo.

"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Rippy's is a favorite of tourists and locals alike.  This place gets slammed during football and hockey season and especially if there are big concerts happening around town.  The only thing I have had at Rippy's are the ribs, which were super tender and fall off the bone.  The upstairs area is a great location for watching the tourists and homeless musicians.  At times the service leaves a little to be desired, but because of the sheer popularity of the place, I really don't expect much better from them.  Overall, check it out if you have not been there or if there is an event at the Sommet center.",Rippy’s,6152447477,292 reviews,2008-10-07,"West Palm Beach, FL",/biz/rippys-nashville,4.0,372,"Washington, DC",Robert K.
"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"i went there for dinner. i guess there's music there every night. it was good but the music outside the restaurant by the street performers were better. when the night is so quiet and all you hear is one singer on the street corner singing into a microphone, it's like the perfect stage.the ribs were covered with pepper that i had to scrap off. i was hoping for a honey bbq sauce or marinade so i was very disappointed. the corn bread was too much and not good enough for me to finish.overall eh.... not worth it.",Rippy’s,6152447477,155 reviews,2008-09-09,"San Diego, CA",/biz/rippys-nashville,1.0,372,"Washington, DC",Yvonne L.

"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Good for what it is - live music with drinks and food. Before jumping to any conclusions, let me preface what I'm about to say with ""i don't drink beer. i hate it. i've tried it many, many, many times and i fully don't enjoy it"". What I do enjoy, however, is food. And this place was at best meh. Ordered the nachos and cheeseburger. Nachos were ok until a few hours later when I started to have heartburn that continued for the rest of the night. The cheeseburger was equivalent to that of a hospital cafeteria - fills your stomach but extremely untasty on the way down. The wine was in a pretty little 8oz plastic cup which made me feel like I was trying to pretend to drink grape juice. Overall, wouldn't come back. Live music wasn't any added pleasure. The reason they do a whole lot of business is probably, at best guess, they're location.

"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Rippy's is located right in the heart of downtown Nashville on Broadway and like many other reviewers, we were planning on going to Jack's across the street.  After seeing the line at Jack's and listening to our tummies grumble, we went with Rippy's instead.  The food was decent....I had pulled pork on texas toast and a bowl of brunswick stew.  The pork was a little on the dry side, but I think the grease from the toast and the slathering of vingear-based BBQ sauce I put on it really helped.  The stew was really good and came with two corn cakes (i.e. pancakes made from cornbread batter) that were sweet and a good compliment to the spicy stew.  I'm inclined to say that prices were a little on the high side for the overall quality, mostly due to the extra $1 I got charged to get fries instead of slaw or beans.  C'mon!  This is a BBQ joint...people want fries with their meals!  The waitress was a little slow, but she did her job and we all had fairly full glasses of sweet tea most the time.  This place did it for me at the time, but I will be trying Jack's next time I go to Nashvegas.",Rippy’s,6152447477,73 reviews,2009-05-12,"Charlotte, NC",/biz/rippys-nashville,3.0,372,"Washington, DC",Kristin F.

"429 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Rippy's is another great downtown place to escape the country music blasting out of all the Honky Tonks. Though I hear it's a great place to grab a meal, I actually came to Rippy's to hear a friend's favorite Big Band play. With two ridiculously animated guys and a whole lot of instruments, the show was pretty great. I love the big windows that allow for fantastic people watching, however, when good live music is playing the place gets ridiculously crowded downstairs. My friends and I, however, found out there was an upstairs and I came upon one of my favorite Broadway surprises, a roof top patio! Though the hoards of people smoking ruined it a little, I had a great time staring at the ever so entertaining show that is Broadway on a Friday night.  It's also Nashville Preds fans favorite pre and post game stop as they usually have drink specials in honor of Nashville's hockey team supreme.",Rippy’s,6152447477,328 reviews,2008-10-27,"San Francisco, CA",/biz/rippys-nashville,3.0,372,"Washington, DC",Mariela C.
