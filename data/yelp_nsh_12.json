I don't understand a Margaritaville in Nashville but I also am probably not the actual target demographic of these places...see: my dad who sometimes makes me think he can't find anything else on his XM radio other than Margaritaville. So we've of course been to the one in the Caymans and on Key West. Since clearly these are out of the way places, I didn't get in the way of my parents having their experience here. I was kind of hoping to avoid listening to music...or at least if I was going to have to listen to covers, NOT \"Call Me Maybe\" gone country. It's somewhat loud in here and I imagine as the night goes on it's louder. We were here prior to a hockey game but it was still pretty busy. Since I procured my family a free app coupon I decided I was worthy of the 5 o'clock somewhere which is a take on a Hurricane, which somehow in five years of legal drinking I have never had before. It wasn't bad. I imagine it's one of those things where you're like \"oh this barely tastes like alcohol, I'll have another\" and then suddenly you're hitting on someone you shouldn't be hitting on. Wait what.For that free app, we had the spinach artichoke dip. It wasn't bad, I certainly wouldn't have let anyone pay full price for it though. I wasn't feeling like having a full on sandwich or anything but there aren't really any smaller sized options. I guess a cup of soup but I had had soup for lunch and it was like obscenely hot for December so that was out of the question. I decided to just get the chicken quesadilla app and if I didn't finish it then whatever. The rest of my family had burgers or a chicken sandwich. The burgers were liked all around, although my brother got the diablo one and complained that it wasn't spicy enough. But I don't think he understands that poblanos aren't that hot.The quesadilla wasn't bad, there were some spots though where the chicken was a bit tough. Nothing you can't fix with a good bit of salsa though. Even though like I said it was pretty busy, we were there only about an hour. Service was great. Would I come back on my own? Probably not.

It is an impressive stack of covered nachos. For entrees I would recommend their Fish Tacos or Jerk Chicken.

I went here this past weekend with a large group of girlfriends. We had high hopes and were disappointed quickly.

My hair was soaked, my dress soaked and ruined, and my cowboy boots were drenched. The server walked away without saying a word. Another patron came up to me with napkins to help wipe me off and ask if I was okay to make sure no broken glass was on me. (Seems like everyone else in Nashville was sweet and respectful..just not the workers at this bar.) A few minutes later another server came over to clean up the mess. I explained to her what happened and said that I knew it was an accident, but asked if there was any way I could get a free drink for the inconvenience. She first replied saying it was the customers in the bar's fault for never moving out of the way. (Nice customer service- if your bar is so full, follow your capacity limits.) I then explained that I understood it was an accident, that I wasn't the one in the way, and that I didn't think she was a bad server or anything, I was just asking politely for a free drink. She explained that she was a server there and wouldn't get me one. I then asked if there was someone else to talk to, which she said she would go find. 5-10 minutes later nobody came so we asked the bartender for the manager. The manager was just as RUDE! I explained that the server spilled a tray of drinks on me and he said it was my fault since I bumped into her. I explained it wasn't me that bumped her since I was at the bar. He then followed through with trying to say that I didn't even look wet. I asked him if he wanted to come over and feel my soaking wet dress which he then followed up with saying he wouldn't give anything to me for free. I asked if anything could be done for the inconvenience, I was open to any ideas, but he said there was nothing that could or would be done.

We waited 7 minutes to be seated. I know this exact time, because I received a phone call as we walked in, so I excused myself and came in after that. That call was 7 minutes and 42 seconds. My party was still standing at the hosteess station. The restaurant was not half full. It appeared to be a slow night. There was no hostess or greeter on hand. We were asked had we been helped, and were finally seated by our server. I went directly to the restroom. Upon returning to the table within a few moments, drinks were being brought to the table. I immediately asked, \"Don't you all wait until all parties are at the table before taking orders. \" Our server, simply stated sorry. I ordered a strawberry lemonade as did the rest of my party. I was then informed, \"It may take a while, since we just ran out of lemonade\" so I ordered a sweet tea and water. We all placed our orders and waited patiently. We sat chatting amongst ourselves and drinking our drinks. Our server came and brought refills of water, to 2 of the 4 glasses at the table, while our lemonades and sweet teas were not refilled. Our food came, still no refills. At this point, I'm thinking did they run out of sweet tea as well? Finally I asked can I have a refill to either my water or sweet tea. Both of my glasses had ice only at this time. So I was given a refill of water. WOW!! Finally after waiting long enough I asked another server to ask my server for a sweet tea refill. Our food came, and I immediately asked for extra parmesan and croutons. A male server brought me croutons and dressing. The most upsetting part was the MOUSE that ran across the floor. At this point we asked for checks and were ready to go. While we sat there, my husband drank a sip of his water, and said it's time to go now in an upset voice. I asked him what's wrong, and he showed us a dead fly floating in his water!! As we walked out a CPK employee said thanks for coming, hope you enjoyed dinner and the show in a joking voice. This was a very upsetting experience. I don't see anything funny about it.

That pizza is well done, the BBQ sauce slightly sweet but not overwhelmingly so, and the red onions adding a bit of kick to the slices. \u00a0Still, it's not too different from other places that sell BBQ chicken pizza these days such as Boscos. The restaurant does have a wide variety of pizzas to choose from, ranging from Classical and Hawaiian to a Jamaican Jerk and Pear and Gorgonzola Pizza. \u00a0The Wild Mushroom pizza did impress me with its deep savory flavors coming from the four different types of mushrooms.

Benihana (out west) was my first and then Kobe's in Nashville became our standard. Because the bar was set so high with the \"pros\" in the business I was reluctant to try Toyama more than five years ago after it opened. However, their lunch menu prices were very reasonable there wasn't anything to lose. Wow! There was no reason to be reluctant...this place is great! Their sauces are headlined by Chad's \"Yum-Yum\" sauce complemented by the popular Teriyaki Sauce, Ginger-Soy, and Hot Chili Paste. The Ginger Salad Dressing is the kind with a bit a mayo and is very good. It has changed hands from the original owner but they retained their head chef (Chad) which is a huge bonus...because he is the one who makes all of the incredible sauces! All the chefs are great cooks but Chad keeps the kitchen running consistently. Each chef has their own idea of how done the steaks are and how long to cook the shrimp. On one hand the lack of consistency in food prep may bother some and on the other hand it's great the the food is somewhat nuanced by each chef. I like it. When in doubt...ask for Chad!I really enjoy the lunch at Toyama's and it's a great spot to \"see\" some stars that live in Nashville. However, for dinner, my affair with Kobe's just can't be overcome.

They give nifty frosted glasses for ice water, and oddly shaped (but usable) beer glasses. Adds to the fun.It is a family owned restaurant, according to one friend who knew the owner/waitress. The father cooks in the back, while the mother and daughter are waitresses/cashiers.Onto the food: we ordered family style. Pad Thai, Angry Shrimp, Basil Chicken, some kind of vegetable sautee, and Penang curry with shrimp. Prices of all those dishes ranged from $9-$13. We also got generous portions of white rice.In a word, all of the food was great. The Pad Thai was slightly saucier/oilier than I've had, but it was a pleasant surprise. All of the other The basil chicken, vegetable, and angry shrimp had similar brown sauces with varying degrees of spiciness. They were all well prepared (perhaps a bit too similar, but it was all great, so no complaints). I loved mixing the sauces with white rice.Each table is outfitted with a tiny carousel of 4 spices/sauces. My friends used these more than I did, but it's a great way to allow each person to customize to their own levels of spiciness/flavor. Incidentally, Sukho offers multiple levels of hotness for their dishes, including \"Native Thai.\" I was curious to try this, but was warned by my friends that it was pretty insane. I'll save that for another date.A couple others have noted that it's not super authentic, which I disagree with. The restaurant does offer a mix of other cuisines (specifically Chinese and Japanese sushi). However, I don't fault them for this - after living in Nashville for a few months, I get the feeling that all Asian restaurants have to diversify a bit.

BP is a beautiful establishment. There is no doubt about that. However, that is where the pleasantries start and end. The staff is beyond pretentious as is their attempt to produce adequate coffee by use of a Chemex system anyone can obtain. In the amount of time it takes them to make a burnt cup of coffee, I could drive to the airport and probably back. It is far more expensive than the most expensive chain coffee, Starbucks. The hipster revolution, which is far from original and innovative as they are merely rehashing a 1960's and early 70's look with an 1880's and 1920's twist, infest the place. Having Local Honey in front doesn't do much to cut the level of pretentiousness either. Another overpriced goodwill like establishment masquerading as a trendy boutique. On top of that, they do not use locally grown coffee nor do they roast in house. In my travels I've seen far more unique establishments without the pretentiousness, \u00a0with far better coffee, less expensive, and produced in a timely manner that Durante leave late for wherever I'm going. Do yourself a favor, don't go to BP, spend the money to get a Chemex, a kettle(which you probably already own), and by the time you've made your first cup of pour over coffee, you'll have spent less money than a week at BP.", "location": "\nLockeland Springs, TN\n", "exp": " 4 reviews", "date": "2015-09-02"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nTaylor W.\n", "review": "I have some mixed feelings about BP.On the one hand, the establishment and atmosphere is probably the coolest I've ever been too. The garage doors that open in the summer gives the place a very open and inviting appearance. It is also a decently quiet place, at least during the middle of the day when I have gone. Lots of people say it's super hipster, and although the employees give off that vibe, they play old school rap and T-Swift...which is def not hipster. On the other hand, their drinks are extremely expensive. There is a small coffee shop in my hometown that roasts all of their own beans and makes a mean cup of coffee (which has won national awards), for about $2 less than here at BP. So the price is really the only gripe I have, being a recent college grad without a job. But that may not be as big of a deal to other people.Was the coffee at BP good? Yes. Was it worth $6 and some change for an iced coffee? That is a question that people will answer differently. The establishment alone makes me want to come back again...and it makes me want to buy another motorcycle. :)", "location": "\nPeoria, IL\n", "exp": " 5 reviews", "date": "2015-09-22"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nChristie B.\n", "review": "Short version: Great atmosphere, fantastic visual experience. Coffee was underroasted and had that sour stringy flavor that characterizes underroasted beans. Biscuit sandwich was delicious though. This is an expensive place; don't be shy about asking how much stuff costs. Otherwise you might end up paying $10 for a chocolate bar.Long version:Barista Parlor serves up a fancy coffee experience on many dimensions. First of all the place is too cool for words--located in a converted garage with vintage motorcycles on display and for sale. Fabulous pendant lighting, interesting seating, and cool decor. They have old fashioned radios placed in various corners, and they are wired up to their central sound system with a turntable. I was also impressed by the fact that their equipment console was a modern style stand but made out of plywood. I like that mixing of the contemporary with the low end. I kind of want to live in Barista Parlor since it is just that neat.Ok, let's get to the coffee, food, and service. As a long time coffee aficionado who roasts beans at home, seeks out coffee experiences in different cities, and pays close attention to coffee related details, I had high expectations. Luckily we arrived when there was no line and the barista could attend to all our coffee questions. The coffee menu was a bit mysterious to me...it's not entirely clear what you are looking at or what you're getting. There's an element of \"visiting the sacred temple on the hill\" to this place. I had a hard time deciphering the devotionals, even with the assistance of our high priestess of coffee.By the way, be careful, because the religious totems (aka coffee mugs, tshirts, chocolate bars) are expensive. Like really expensive. Like $25 for a mug, $20 for beans, $10 for a chocolate bar, and so forth. Be prepared for additional sticker shock as a standard cup of coffee is $5. Now granted they do an individual pourover for each customer (there are no ready-made pots sitting around), but still...it's pricey.Well, given some of the descriptors on the menu, I asked if one of the coffees was a wet process or dry process bean. The barista went to ask another, and (unfortunately) from the answer, I could tell they had no idea what I was talking about. \u00a0Oh well....we ordered two coffees and one of their fantastic breakfast sandwiches. At about $8 a sandwich, it's a absolute bargain compared to the $5 cup of coffee.I have read other Yelper's comments on service here, and I see where they are coming from. This place is not set up for maximum efficiency. The only menus in the place are right at the cash register, so there is no way to for you to make a selection while waiting in line. Each drink is made by hand in the most labor intensive way possible. I sometimes wonder if this \"artisanal by hand\" process is overly Luddite. Technology helps increase efficiency, and society benefits from it. I think Barista Parlor may tip the scale too far in the other direction, because while they do have all the fancy coffee accoutrements (good espresso machine, good grinder, etc), the process by which the coffee is made and delivered to you is quite slow. When our coffees arrived, they were served on cute little wooden trays. You pour the coffee from a glass carafe into your own cup. The breakfast sandwich was also served on a wooden plank, accompanied by a denim napkin. Practicality aside, the napkin was cute but slightly less than useful. At any rate, the coffee and food were a feast for the eyes. At this point, I'm just happy to be there, happy to be alive, and happy that places like this exist in the world.So I take a sip of coffee. And here's where the magic dies...maybe it's a reaction to the overly burnt roasted bean style of Starbucks, but I've found that every time, every single time I've been to a so-called coffee fanatic type of cafe, the beans are underroasted. Severely underroasted. The taste of the coffee is always sour, stringy, and slightly watery. Underroasted beans impart a sour taste, and make for a terrible cup of coffee. To me, coffee should have a rich, rounded mouthfeel, with a fullness on the tongue, and either a caramel or chocolate essence with a slightly earthy feel. Maybe this is just my preference, but yeah. So it goes. Again, I'm disappointed by yet another fancy coffee place that lets me down. The breakfast sandwich was great though. Lovely, crumbly buttery biscuit, delicious egg, cheese and sausage, very flavorful all around.Well overall, I give Barista Parlor 3 stars. Five stars for ambiance and 2 stars for coffee and price point.

I had the BP Breakfast Sandwich - I didn't know a breakfast sandwich could be this freaking good. Fresh bread (more than likely handmade), thick cut bacon, aioli sauce..etc. It was a generous size for a breakfast sandwich and one of the most delicious I've had. I took my time eating and savored every bite. I also had a chocolate donut, which I had no expectations for, but wow. It was fresh take on a classic. It was super soft, airy like a donut should be, and full of flavor. With the added bonus of a homemade marshmallow in the center. The coffee was on the same level of greatness. I had a hot latte with almond milk (which is a huge perk having non dairy options), and my boyfriend had a iced mocha. Both had a nice velvety finish, and great body. It's more expensive then your average coffee place, but it's so worth it. I think the prices are fair, given the amount of attention that goes into everything.They made two big fans out of us. We bought some souvenirs, local chocolates & a barista parlor glass cup. They also sell growers for iced coffee! I didn't purchase it (though I'm regretting it now) but I asked about it, and the lady at the cashier took the time to tell me about how it's made. I should also point out, that when we first arrived, we told them we were from out of town and they took the time to give us the run down and explored the menu (even though there where a few people behind us).

The first time I came here, I was pretty turned off. Unfortunately, the reviews which mention unfriendly baristas, confusing signage and nonchalant-to-hostile service really rang true. I can't imagine this sort of experience was/is the intention of the founder. I can't understand why this seems to be such a pervasive problem. In any event, I came and was quite satisfied never to return.Fast forward to a rainy evening, bad traffic and guests in need of a coffee break. I breathed deeply and ventured to BP once again. This time, I had a much more pleasant experience. The barista behind the counter was engaging. He answered questions, offered suggestions and made my party feel appreciated for having chosen to give this store money. Okay. I get it. Much better.I'd recommend going for one of the seasonal blends. On my first visit, I had the whiskey caramel and I couldn't finish it. For my tastes, it was too cloying and the flavor profiles within the cup competed, rather than worked together. It was not enjoyable. Upon my second visit, I ordered a seasonal tea blend I enjoyed much much more. The ordering process goes a bit like this: walk in, claim a seat on the reclaimed wood bench and lowrise table (the build out is nicely done; minimal, but that's the point). Walk to the front and hope that you know what you want. If not, take a gander at one of two (?) printed menus and hope that no one will roll his/her eyes at you for taking a minute. I was lucky enough (upon my second visit) to encounter a barista who answered questions and offered suggestions. As a result, my beverage, food and customer experience was greatly improved from my initial visit. And, speaking of food, go for the homemade pop-tart. My butterscotch chocolate chunk scone was too much for me. Again, for my tastes, the flavor combo curdled a bit in my belly. As you can read from my reviews, my sweet tooth is truth... and this was a pastry I didn't finish. That rarely happens. The pop-tart is a sugar bomb worthy of the calories and cavity risk.The problem with BP is that it can be painfully hip... almost to the point of farce. Parking can be a bit of a chore (tip: drive through to the other side, if entering from Gallatin). Music varies depending on who's working. My first visit's playlist verged on the you-need-Jesus-Tipper-was-right tip. My next visit was a trip down the '90s hip-hop road. I enjoyed that much more. The good thing about Barista Parlor is that it has a definite point of view. The bad part about it is that I don't know if the execution of said point of view is an ultimately sustainable business model. You simply can't make a habit of alienating the people who keep your lights on -- especially when the price point is so deliberate. I'm glad I made a return visit in order to improve my opinion.

I hate parallel parking and there wasn't any open spots anyway so I circled around a couple of times until I found someone coming out of their parking lot. The shop is huge and was very crowded.

It sucks that so many people have had that kind of experience but I already knew what I wanted walking in since I had heard yelpers talk about the Iced Bourbon Barrel Vanilla Latte. I got up to the guy taking the order and told him what I wanted drink-wise along with a campfire scone made with marshmallows, chocolate and graham crackers along with a strawberry basil macaroon.

As a Portland native who watched the coffee scene grow up and evolve into what it is today, who sat in Stumptown cafes twice a week for years, who worked for a high-end coffee roaster and who recently moved to Nashville, I hope that I have some credibility to bear. I first visited Barista Parlor in late 2013 or early 2014. I ordered a V60 cup of some single-origin by Madcap. While the profile appeared decent, it was shockingly watered-down. I thought it was a joke and it was a bit insulting after paying a premium for it, but I was down the road and not willing to go back and wait in line to fight about it.In early 2015, I went and waited outside, but sent in someone with $50, to get me a mocha with Stumptown Hair Bender and a bag of Fourbarrel Guatemala. Off we went down the road and I sampled my mocha in dismay and eventually disgust. To add insult to injury, my change was exactly $20 and, at that point, I felt a strong desire to go in and tell them something about themselves. Instead, I'm here to put them in their rightful place in a more public way. If you're not from Portland, you probably don't know that espresso shots in all Stumptown cafes are made with their own Hair Bender blend of beans. I consumed it in all manner of drinks, at ALL Stumptown locations in Portland, served up by many different baristas for years. I have also frequented any number of other independent cafes in Portland that serve Stumptown exclusively. So, when I say that I KNOW what Hair Bender is and what it should be, hear me.My \"Hair Bender\" mocha from Barista Parlor was not cohesive, lacked the subtle touch of sweetness I expect in a mocha and lacked any real body. In fact, in spite of my years of experience with this espresso blend, I would have never guessed that it was Hair Bender. It was absolutely shameful, in my careful analysis.Now about the Fourbarrel beans: At home, for drip brewing, I use tools by Technivorm, Bonavita, Rancilio and Baratza. (I also use a Bodom French-press once in a while.) I use filtered water and the whole bit. I brewed up the Fourbarrel coffee that probably cost me $25 of the $30 I spent the night before. Was it amazing and mind-blowing? No. It was decent, but I expect much more at that price point. I played with the machines and there was no sweet spot I could find. This is not $25 coffee - not even close. Once again, pitching it as such is shameful.You need to know that I did not first walk into Barista Parlor feeling cynical or convinced of all the hype; I just wanted some quality coffee. (My friends and I frequented Stumptown not because it was \"cool,\" but because the cups never disappointed.I can appreciate the atmosphere at Barista Parlor, apart from hints of SoCal-style pretense. However, at the end of the day - and with a name such as theirs - the coffee should be the main attraction and stand up on its own, regardless of atmosphere or conjecture from uninformed hipster hopefuls who consider Charbucks or Ugly Mugs to be points of reference. \u00a0So, if you want a quality cup of coffee in Nashville, keep looking.

This actually is what made this place work better for me more than the other location, and I really liked the rough-around-the-edges feel to this place.I ordered the same items also - Moto Biscuit (egg and cheese) - I made them add extra white cheddar cheese, and also asked them to slather some apple butter on it. This made all the difference over the one at Golden Sound.Unfortunately, their espresso machine was broken, so I couldn't have the Bourbon Barrel Vanilla Latte that I wanted. :-( This was the biggest bummer, so even though I liked this location MORE than the Golden Sound, I'm gonna have to bump them down a notch.

No I am not joking) that range in price from 6-8$ per chocolate bar. By the time you get to the front where you place your order, you then have the opportunity to look at the menu.

Great coffee drink too.. I think it was called Mocha Madness or something. A little pricey but if you can splurge, do so on an amazing breakfast you'll have!! My mom and I spent $63 (not including tip) but that was 2 meals, a couple of their decadent and rich cookies, and three of their awesome looking chocolate bars. We loved their different selection of chocolate and pastry items. Definitely very hipster, but was happy to see many people of all ages there, from as young as early 20's to probably mid 50's. The staff was super friendly and helped us find everything. The decor is very cool. Loved the wood tables. The only thing I didn't like was that the condiments, napkins, and silverware was not easy to find. Napkins and straws were at the register (weird place for that kind of stuff since they bring the food and drinks out to you) and then sugar, coffee stirs, and syrup are in a totally different place.

The coffe, dont get me wrong, is very very good - but so are a lot (a lot- I mean Nashville has tons of coffee spots) good coffee places in Nashville. The prices are getting mildly out of control. An iced (cold brew) coffee is now $5.5 - thats a lot. I really think overall the prices reflect the vibe and you are paying for the atmosphere. It is an awesome place to hang out - if you are trendy and live in East Nash. My sister and I came here for a coffee sister date and we sat at the high bar chairs around the edges. They are mildly uncomfortable as you can't really lean back and doesn't promote talking since its hard to not bang your knees against each other when sitting on the bar thats so narrow. The other long tables on the floor are awesome though. They have amazing lattes - my favorite is the bourbon barrel vanilla- oh man. The caramel is also great.

And he sho knows it too. We decided to make the trek (all 10 mins of it) to East Nashville to see what all the hype over Barista Parlor was. I have heard that it's considered one of the best in the nation...but better then that, my fabulously awesome hair stylist had recommended I stop by that very same day. Location: Barista Parlor is tucked away in the back of a shopping strip with boutique (no) choices like Rainbow fashions. It is right next door to Groove and Porter Road Butcher so you can use those as landmarks. The parlor is fenced off and has an amazing home made stage that you can imagine would make for the best live shows. There is some patio seating but I would say minimal... Parking is an interesting situation since you sort of have to drive through past the stage to get to the back. When you walk inside the parlor/garage you get a definite urban chic feel. They have pendant style exposed lighting hanging from the ceilings with walls full of coffee and coffee accessories. They carry the Aeropress...and for true coffee lovers.. you know. Coffee: It certainly takes a while to get your coffee, but its worth it. They have certain drip times that they follow and their method makes for the purest tasting coffee. Or so I am told. I rock out to pumpkin spice keurig, so yeah. A cup of coffee is going to run you $4. But like a lot of places in Nashville, the price is worth the ambience. Of note, I was seriously confused where their menu was... they carry two at the register...which of note...also took me a second to find. There is an enormous selection of packaged roasts on sale. However, they do not list prices. I was curious and asked and turns out the coffees run typically $16-22. Which is pricey...but it really is high quality coffee. AND ALSO for you (me) Keurig drinkers. We did an experiment the other day by dissecting out a keurig cup, weighing the contents and then doing some simple math.... y'all we are paying almost $30 a lb for coffee! Mind. Blown.Tea: Carries Intelligentsia teaTables: SUPER cool selection. You can choose your long communal study station or split off into the 2 people hanging side tables. Music: It's definitely on the louder side. I would bring really good headphones. However, the music is pretty chill and I personally liked it. I really enjoyed my experience here and will definitely be back. It's not really ideal for studying given how loud the music is...and its not definitely a place to pick up your daily coffee given the price point.

I traveled to Italy at least once a year and it is almost impossible to get a bad cup of espresso, but anywhere else in the world it can be pretty tough to get a good one, but, if you search hard enough you are mostly able to find at least one place in a city that is able to make it properly. Also I am a hobby barista and have a lot of experience with Italian portafilter machines. So I heard about BP as probably the best coffee / espresso spot in town and was excited to check it out. First of all I was impressed by the design of the place and it all looked super professional at the first sight and I loved to see, that they have the slayer espresso machine with which you can make amazing espresso. So far, so good. The prices where shocking, especially for the simple espresso. $4 dollars for a cup of espresso and just 50ct more for a cappuccino. Normally the espresso should be more like closer to half the price of a cappuccino. I don't mind to pay for good quality, but also my expectations where pretty high and since a filtered cup of coffee was the same price and looked like one of their signature drinks, I started with that first. I took the \"handsome\". It looked also professional how they made it, but when I tried it, it is was quite disappointing, because it was one of the most sour tasting coffees I ever had and didn't taste good to me at all and I couldn't keep drinking it. So I thought I have to try the pure espresso since they have the slayer machine also. I ordered one of the two espresso bean choices and when it came I was already disappointed by how the crema looked. The color was a little too dark, but more important there was not much crema at all and it was too thin. The taste was horrible, it was really one of the worst espresso experiences that I ever had. It was so sour that it almost hurt my throat. I went back to the counter and explained why I cannot enjoy the espresso and the gentleman offered me to do another one with the other type of beans. It looked the same and tasted even worse, more sour. I just had two sips and couldn't finish it. A female associate came by and asked, if everything is ok now and I explained that I am really disappointed with the taste and wanted to explain why. She interrupted me and tried to explain me that they use a different machine (slayer) and darker roasted (Italian style) coffee beans, which I already was aware of. She was not interested in what I wanted to say and just gave me a little toffee as an apology. They did not offer me a refund or anything similar. She gave me the feeling, that I don't know anything about good coffee and that I think the coffee tastes so bad, because I have a bad taste and never had good coffee in my life.

Short line (for me) that quickly extended 15-20 people deep by 9:15AM or so. My rundown:Pros:-Great coffee selection. Wide variery of roasts with flavor profiles listed below each option. You can also choose the way that you would like it brewed. V60 (basic brew method) generally starts at $4, which is fairly priced considering nothing is pre-brewed. I got the Stumptown. Was perfectly brewed!-Peach Waffle was a great choice. Perfect amount of syrup served along with the waffle. Menu looked like it had plenty of other great eats-Ambiance was what blew my mind the most. The little pixelated mosaic on the back wall really helped brighten up the space. Very wide open setup that did not make you feel like someone was breathing over your shoulder/reading your morning Reddit feed.-Huge selection of coffee beans and brewing aparatuses. I've never seen bags of coffee this big. If Amazon were to ever implode, would definitely come here to buy a backup Chemex and replenish the pre-apocalyptic bean reserve.Cons:-Took a little while to get my food. I was second in line upon walking in and guessed another 4 people were ahead of me for food. By the time the Waffle arrived, I had finished my coffee because it was getting cold. Not a huge con since this was the first cup of the day.-Only received a fork with the utencil set. Would have been nice to get a knife as well to cut the waffle and peaches. I sent a peach flying across the plate after trying to cut it with a knife. Not sure if there were knives elsewhere in the shop.-Slanted mini barstools surrounding the coffee bar were a tad uncomfortable. This could be understandable if the low bar had outlets and the stools were designed as a means to prevent Wifi squatters. No outlets though. Tl;dr: Great place to get an excellent cup of coffee and bite to eat in a creative environment.

Are you looking for some coffee steeped in pretension? Have I got the place for you!Let's start with the obvious. You're not going to get your coffee quickly at this place. Though, a single glance at the long line of hipsters would have told you that. You'll probably spend about 20 min waiting to order. Maybe you can spend that time looking at a menu? Guess again, hotshot! Hipsters don't need menus! You'll find one, that's right, ONE, framed at the cash register. Even then, when you finally see the menu, none if it will make sense. There's a bunch of \u00a0v + number business that somehow refers to the method by which the coffee is freshly brewed. If you stare too long at the menu, the barista will doubt your authenticity, so just quickly order whatever the person in front of you had.When I say the barista will doubt your authenticity as a coffee drinker, what I mean is that this is inevitable so you should just prepare yourself to feel like an idiot. I ordered a cup of freshly brewed coffee and requested some almond milk to go with it. Do they have almond milk? Of course. Will they put it in your coffee? HELL NO. That might spoil the pure and heavenly black elixir that they have painstakingly brewed for your exclusive admiration. The barista eventually agreed to give me a cup of almond milk on the side, that I might add to my coffee, but only after making me promise, out loud, to taste the coffee without it. This really happened.Of course, after the 20 min in line, you'll spend 20 min waiting for your coffee and food, so your total minimum time in the barista parlor is 40 min, guaranteed. Food is upscale and good, though slightly overpriced. An acceptably tasty biscuit with fancy meats, etc. The coffee is obviously perfect. How could it not be? But you'll find it difficult to relax amidst the massive amount of douchery.The real product on display at this place is not the coffee, it's the baristas. The whole operation seems geared towards making you marvel at these hip baristas wearing their leather aprons and making coffee with their willy wonka coffee contraptions.

Anyway, I'm really impressed.This places oozes of awesome ambience. From the garage doors to the mosaic tile to the aged wood to the baristas wearing early 20th century attire, the word to describe it is \"neat.\" Even the lighting has that old-timer feel, which is a refreshing and relaxing change compared to the fluorescent or over-modernized incandescent stuff you see in most shops. In short, it's the kind of place you'd expect to find in East Nashville.As for my whiskey caramel iced coffee, the presentation matches the motif. Served in a Mason jar, I secretly wished that it might contain moonshine. No dice. The flavor was pretty good, although it took about 10 minutes to get it. I'd already eaten, else I would have scarfed down some of the pretty decent looking food I saw others eating. Well, probably not THEIR food, because that would be rude, but you get the idea.There are a few power outlets scattered around, and that seems to be enough for a slow day where at most a third of us are poking away on our laptops. It might be problematic if it were a busier afternoon.It's a pretty eclectic mix of people. You have your usual flannel-wearing East Nash hipsters, of course, but folks in dress slacks have come in too. And if you're wondering whether there are pretty people, the answer is yeah. Speaking of, to the guy next to me, Zach Morris called and wants his hair back.Areas to improve? First, as others have mentioned, parking's a bit rough. Despite it not being crowded, there was only one space left in the back. Also, the music should get cranked down a couple notches.

Most of the negative reviews I'm reading are purely based on people not knowing the difference between Starbucks and a one-of-a-kind boutique coffee shop that serves incredibly high-quality coffee. You wouldn't dare go to a five-star restaurant and ask the chef to hold three ingredients and add two you prefer. You wouldn't complain about there being three forks and not knowing which to use. You certainly wouldn't complain about the portion sizes on a four course meal. Why? Because this isn't Golden Corral. You don't smother your french fries in a sea of ketchup and pay $9 for all you can eat ribs. That might be what you are used to, but that doesn't mean all restaraunts operate in that fashion. Barista Parlor is unique in that it's offering the best espresso/coffee beans from around the country. If you go to Stumptown in Seattle, you get their amazing roasters serving up their coffee. If you find yourself at Blue Bottle or Sightglass in San Francisco, it's the same high-caliber baristas pulling decadent shots and truly crafting your drink using their product. Barista Parlor stocks the best beans from all of these places and lays them out for your choosing. Ok, ok... I guess it is a little like Golden Corral... but more like if the best chefs in the world were preparing the food. None the less, people should expect to pay a little more for renowned espresso being pulled through a thirty-thousand dollar machine. You should pay a little more for craft and precision. It's not even that much more expensive. A cappuccino at Starbucks would run me $3.10. I payed a whopping $1 more at Barista Parlor for a cappucino that supremely destroys Starbucks. Which brings me to my last point...If you don't LOVE the taste of GREAT coffee. DO NOT COME HERE! If you are absolutely fine with the \"Super Dark Roast Arabica Robusto Blend\" they serve at Thornton's gas stations, then you should totally go save some money and get your caffeine fix.

Along Gallatin, you will see shop after shop, but Barista Parlor is like a hipster's dream. I drove by it at least twice the first couple of times I went. It sits on the corner, by Rainbow Fashion, but back from the street, on the side of the building. The parking is a bit iffy, because you have to drive through the gates to get to it. This is not the place to get a quick coffee and go. The lines sometimes is out the door and the wait can be 30 minutes or longer just to get up to the register, however, their coffee is some of the best in Nashville. The baristas are extremely knowledgeable and although they may seem pretentious, are more than willing to explain to you anything you want to know about a drink they clearly have a passion for. Along with the experience comes a higher than normal price tag. At $4 for a simple carafe of coffee like the one shown, the cost may be prohibitive, however, I think it's worth it for all you get along with it. The seating in Barista Parlor is arranged around the central coffee making station and I really enjoy watching the baristas work. You can get coffee made in various ways, each a little different than the last. My favorite coffees are the Bourbon Barrel Vanilla Latte ($6/iced), the Caramel Latte or the Mocha. The regular coffees change periodically, but they are all delicious and, like I said, the baristas are more than happy to lead you through their slightly overwhelming menu full of not just different coffee options, but different preparations as well.

Ridiculous to have to walk across a room and serve myself after paying an ungodly amount of money.

My husband felt he was a part of a circus act trying to eat his crumbling biscuit and catch the falling pieces on his tiny, bottled cap sized plate.

They don't locally source beans or roast in house, but they get great coffee. Stumptown and such. Employees are nice for the most part, but some treat you with a little bit of a too cool attitude / coffee snobbery. I used to work in a coffee shop that roasted in house and was very serious about coffee. I learned a lot there. One time I came to Barista Parlor and ordered an americano. The girl said \"sorry, we can't make americanos.\" What? I was confused. \"Why not\" I asked. Her actual response was \"it compromises the integrity of the bean.\" Well shit. Then she tried to make a case that their espresso machine is super high end and special and isn't capable of making americanos. Does it make espresso? Do you have hot water? Yes and Yes. Can I get them together in one cup? No. That's crazy to refuse to make a customer something they way they would like and explain it to them in a way that tells them \"you do it wrong, moron.\" Anyway I didn't argue. It's just the way it was put. You should make what your customer asks for (unless it's a coffee milkshake or something like that). The other thing is that it can take up to 30 minutes to get a coffee. That's a real time I waited for a shot of espresso. They are slow and not just because of the V60 and Chemex brewing methods. Once I ordered an iced tea. They had the stuff pre made in their fridge. They mindlessly put the ticket in line and proceeded to make 2 Chemex brewed coffees which took over ten minutes. Then they made my iced tea in 10 seconds. (hint: that's not the efficient way to do that). There was also another employee walking around the counter doing little tidying tasks. They could have poured the iced tea, but they didn't. So, they could improve their timing, but I think they want it to be slow to make a point. I think that's actually their business model.I'll give them this, the last time I went in it was more pleasant. But you still have to wait for a long time for a coffee or espresso shot or whatever you order. Sometimes I want to go get a coffee from there, but I don't know how long I'll be waiting or what the employees will be like so I skip it and go to bongo java.

Another reason is because, once you're there, you don't really know what your options are for coffee. It's not a huge problem, not a big deal at all and I have no qualms mostly because I am a coffee nerd and I don't need too terribly much instruction and I am not afraid to ask. However, some people want to know what they're getting right off the bat and hate asking questions and this may, on the first visit, be a tiny turn-off.Owner Andy Mumma is a coffee craftsman and he did say in an interview that he intended this to be the speakeasy of coffee shops. That may seem pretentious to some but one man's pretentiousness is this girl's gain - more good coffee for me!Food wise, their kitchen closes at noon so take that into consideration if you're planning to eat. The waffles are good - I ordered mine with a side of Porter Road Butcher sausage. The pastries are also made locally, and if you're on the go, grab a bar of chocolate to have with your coffee! They serve and sell coffee from good roasteries like Intelligentsia, Coava and Mad Cap and I highly recommend ordering the Intelligentsia brewed with the Hario V60 either hot or over ice. Honestly, just try it all. Sit and watch them brew your coffee, ask questions (the people who own it and the staff are SO nice, so friendly and ready to help you learn more about coffee) and treat yourself to some lovely brews.

We took our 5 month old and there were some other kids as well. \u00a0There were plenty of kidless, well-dressed hipsters and we all coexisted quite pleasantly. \u00a0One note of suggestion for Barista Parlor: some kind of board with the day's offering would be great so that while you are waiting in line you can be thinking about your order. \u00a0We had to wait until we were at the register to even look at the food and coffee selections and I felt rushed since there were a few people in line behind us. \u00a0Either that or print out you offerings and put some copies on clipboards along the line. \u00a0We will definitely be going back (since it is only a 5 minute walk from our house) but we may have to limit it to a once a week treat.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 28 reviews", "date": "2012-06-13"}, {"rating": "2.0", "name": "\nKayla B.\n", "review": "I walked in and asked for a caffe breve.

As I walked in to the coffee shop, I immediately knew that it was going to be a winner. A shelf on the left had bags from my favorite coffee roaster, Counter Culture coffee, followed by the famous Stumptown coffee from Portland, Oregon. As I approached the barista and inquired as to my options, I was filled with information regarding coffee varieties, pour over options (hario v60, chemex, etc). I decided on the Teklu Dembel from Ethiopia per the friendly barista's suggestion, and was quite satisfied of the near-maximum extraction by the barista's skilled hands.

The owners must not read the Yelp reviews about service and suggestions or they would have listened to our same issues over a year later. When we first went in, we didn't know if we were to sit down or walk to the cash register on the side of large dining room - no one greeted us and the small staff of 3 was busy making coffee for the full house. They need a sign at the front with an arrow pointing to \"Order Here\" and a menu of the day written out or printed. You do indeed go to the cash register (they need 2 cashiers) and order from a small wooden menu (they have 2 in the whole place I think) - very inefficient.

Within two minutes of being inside the establishment, you've probably noted five people insta-graming their drinks.

Maybe they were having a bad day, but in my experiences in public service, it isn't very nice to scoff at people who are going to be handing you money in a minute. My girlfriend came with me (she isn't much of a coffee drinker) and asked if they had any teas. She was essentially baby-talked and mansplained to in a chivalrous way about how they only serve COFFEEEEEeeee and seemed to sugest that she was an idiot for thinking otherwise.

It was a tough decision - I don't like being a slave to my addiction, but the coffee choices are broader and the Alzheimer's studies are compelling, so here I am. Conveniently, that makes Barista Parlor a perfect place for me now. I am exactly the type of coffee drinker they cater to - obsessed with high quality, recently roasted beans prepared with good single-cup brewing methods. And so, I will be going to Barista Parlor regularly, because they serve me very, very well. And the food menu with all locally-sourced components is exquisite - expensive, but worth every penny.So why 3 stars? 3 reasons.1) They don't have any locally roasted coffee choices. Now, I know that our local roasters are not necessarily all great, but I've tasted nearly every coffee from Roast, Inc. and certainly think at least one or two of them could compete with the coffees Barista Parlor serves. They support (and allow their customers to support) local businesses with their food menu and chocoloate options (despite the fact that Olive and Sinclair is really not quite up to the standard of their other chocolates), so why not offer at least one local option?2) No decaf. When Barista Parlor was about to open, I had a conversation with the owner about this - basically, it was pretty clear from his demeanor that he thinks decaf coffees can't possibly compete with caffeinated coffees. He is wrong. Counter Culture, Coava, Intelligentsia, and, yes, Roast Inc. all sell decaffeinated coffees that are just as delicious, complex, and expensive as the coffees Barista parlor currently sells. Some of them are even single-origin, though admittedly blends are more common. Even if he tastes them all and disagrees (and I'm certain he hasn't), why not at least offer a decaf espresso? I promise, whatever quality difference his discerning palate can find will be drowned out by the milk and sugar in a latte, and preparation is 90% of a good espresso anyway. Now that they are open later, this seems like even more of a problem - I would love a cup of coffee at 4 pm, but I can't drink caffeine that late if I want to sleep. I'm sure I'm not alone. 3) Demeanor. Okay, you don't want to offer decaf, soy milk, or Splenda - fine. I think you're nuts - personally, I only drink coffee black, but I still wouldn't open a coffee shop without milk or sugar out of some weird desire to bring people around to my opinion, because I respect others' opinions - but it's your business. Find a way to stand by your decisions without making your customers feel like yokels. If they're talking to you about your decisions, it means they want your product - well-prepared, high quality coffee - and are willing to pay the justifiably exorbitant prices to do so. Treat them like crap, and they're very likely never to return.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 25 reviews", "date": "2012-06-17"}, {"rating": "1.0", "name": "\nCarriga C.\n", "review": "cool atmosphere and normally somewhere i would like to go. definitely trying in every way to come across as super hipster (hidden away behind a strip mall in an old car garage, artisan light bulbs hanging everywhere and distressed everything...like it came straight out of an episode of portlandia), which evidently includes the owners attitude toward customers...no soy milk...only almond, which is a bummer when youre allergic to almonds...read a couple of other reviews that said that the owner really doesnt care that there are people who cant have or dont want almond milk and would prefer soy...fine i guess, but what happens if youre unhappy with something else?", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 1 review", "date": "2012-08-25"}, {"rating": "2.0", "name": "\nHousecharmer C.\n", "review": "I might add to Michael P's review below which was spot on and hilarious for us...I do get the purity of this place but this is my morning jolt! \u00a0I have been around great coffee since I opened one of the first coffee bars in San Francisco in 1972.

Now in some cities this would not be at all remarkable, in New York and Chicago this is no big deal, but in a town where meatless Chinese food is limited to veggie eggrolls and the occasionally well-prepared Homestyle Bean Curd (China Spring does both of these pretty well) this is remarkable.This is a new menu item for the 'Spring and the first time I ordered it, it was so-so--the tofu was kind-of hard, the sauce too sweet and not at all spicy. I almost didn't order it again, but I am so very glad I did!Since my last visit they have perfected this dish. I asked for it extra spicy and it came out just right. If you've never had really good Chinese meatless dishes you will be blown away by this one. On my second taste, the fried tofu was so perfectly cooked I can only describe the texture as fluffy.

I'm not sure why. I've always loved pizza but it's starting to become an addiction. I opened up yelp to see if I could try any new pizza places. I've heard of Fox Dens before but never had it. I check their website & saw a \"today's special\" for one large topping pizza for $7.99. I figured that would be something good to try. I called & ordered a pepperoni pizza. The pizza would be ready in 10-15 minutes. I made my way over after work. This location is located off Elm Hill Pike in a strip mall. I've passed by this strip mall a million times but never noticed Fox Dens in it. I pulled up & walked inside. The shop is small, a couple tables are inside if you'd like to eat there. The woman didn't ask for my name over the phone, but it was 5:30 & I guess they didn't get a lot of call in ordered because she knew the pepperoni pizza was mine. I also noticed that they had a 100 score from the health department. That always makes me feel good. My total was $8.74 & I was on my way. The weight of the pizza seemed a little light to me for a large. The box was big though. I waited to look at it when I got home. I opened the box and noticed how big it was. I'm not sure if the inchage (is that a word?) but they cut the large into ten pieces. I like that. It also makes me feel like a fatty because I ate 5 slices. I thought the pepperoni pizza was great for the $7.99 price. The crust and bottom had the right amount of crisp to it. I liked how the cheese was cooked golden brown. The amount of pepperoni was good, however I thought the amount of cheese was a little spare. Maybe next time I'll order with extra cheese. Was it the best ever?

Sadly, they did not have Crispy Beef but they did have Crispy Basil Chicken and i got the Panag Curry.

The price is 1/2 the cost. But here is the extra. If you or your date or partner both get the Prime Rib they add an appetizer. Not too shabby. But if you want a larger Prime Rib then they add 6 more dollars. Which is 20 dollars compared to J Alexander's 29 version. We had both sizes. The smaller size was thin, not my favorite. The larger size was more like Prime Rib eaters are used to when ordering. Our server was very nice and knowledgeable.

Not even so much as a \"Hi, I'm your server\" or a glass of water. When our \"server\" did finally emerge from the depths of the back of the restaurant, he came out trying to be funny when a plate was dropped and broken in another room stating \"That's not coming out of my paycheck!\" - How professional.When we finally did get to put in our drink orders and appetizer, we hoped the night would turn around. Each time the guy came to our table, then disappeared, it seemed like he stayed in the back longer and longer each time. It took forever to get water, and even longer to get the drinks we ordered from the bar. Not only were we amazed to actually see our server in the 3 times he actually came to the table, but to top things off, he never put in the order for the cheese wedges we'd asked for at the very beginning. He came back and claimed, \"Sorry, I forgot.\" Let me add to this by saying the restaurant was dead. We were one of this champ's only 2 tables.When I say he kept disappearing, I mean he was absent from our table and the only section he was serving, not that I couldn't see him. I was positioned at our table to be able to see directly to the kitchen door and the small area the servers had to make drinks for customers. It seemed many of the wait staff liked to hang out in this little room, playing on their phones and laughing and cutting up with each other. While I don't have a problem with that behavior in general, if you aren't doing your job, then more attention needs to be paid to the customers. I had to physically wave and get someone's attention each time our table needed something. This is not my job. Pay attention to your paying guests!With the exception of the potato soup, all the food was bland, unseasoned, and tasteless. Nothing we'd ever return for. Then, to top it all off, when it was time to check out and leave, our guy was again M.I.A. We finally flagged down someone and asked for our check. The guy came sauntering back and we gave him our 20% off coupon to have it applied to the bill when returned. Naturally, it arrived at the table quite some time later not only WITHOUT the 20% off, but we were charged full price on our appetizer when we'd arrived during the happy hour specials. Of course it took a while to get this fixed, then we finally were able to verify our bill and attempt to pay.By attempt, I mean this cat disappeared with my credit card, and it was over 10 minutes before I even saw him again. When he did poke his head out of the little drink station area, he came back and served the table behind us (without giving me my card back), then had the audacity to walk away AGAIN without returning our bill! After another 5 minutes or so I actually saw the dude sit down at a table and start chatting with other waitstaff (IN the dining area, no less). At this point, our entire table stood up and walked towards the front door. I had to ask 3 different members of the staff for my card back as we'd waited long enough and it was time to leave. Everyone, including our server, seemed shocked that we were ready to go. We'd been waiting far too long. When it's time to pay, take the check and the card, process the charges, and return immediately so you can turn over the table and serve more guests. This is common restaurant service, not rocket science.We will not be returning to this location again based on the service alone, and will be less inclined to visit another O'Charley's any time soon should the food continue the downhill trend it is on now.Side note: We only saw a \"manager\" once, and by saw I mean he poked his head out of the kitchen for two seconds and stood by the drink station, then promptly returned to the back.

Mostly I think the sushi tasted pretty ok, but nothing really stood out as \"amazing\" to me, you know? If I didn't like the fried sushi so much, I might have given this place a 2 instead I imagine.

He's a very picky eater too, but he said it was one of the greatest things he ever tasted. My sushi was FABULOUS. Probably the best I have ever had. I've eaten at many, many, sushi restaurants too. I had the terriayki ball which was great as well as the sweet potato tempura tray.Their menu was huge. It was about four to seven pages. (I don't remember which.)

Very busy at 1:00; I grabbed a seat at the bar, but wasn't there for the lunch buffet, though apparently most everyone else was. There appeared to be 2 servers and one host available for the entire restaurant, which was quite crowded, but not to capacity. I started with a spinach appetizer while I took my time to peruse the menu. When the server finally returned, I asked for an order of Toro and an order of Uni; she'd told me she'd have to see if they had any. She returned quickly, only to to advise no, they had neither. She said they were \"seasonal.\" OK, then maybe that could be noted on the menu??? I didn't care for the spinach appetizer; the long thick stems were attached (big ones, we're not talking baby spinach) and I could handle that, but didn't at all care for the sickly sweet sauce that was pared with it. I was expecting more of a peanut sauce, shame on me for not knowing the difference. I are less than half of the spinach go-ame appetizer. \u00a0 Perusing the menu was a chore, since MANY of the rolls are either deep fried or contain fried items. I typically don't like anything in my rolls to be fried, so at least half the the menu items would be off the list. I ordered a spicy tuna hand roll next. There were three pieces of nigiri tuna within the roll, with a splat of very tasty spicy sauce on top. Also included was a slice of avocado and some cucumber. Sadly, the rice was not evenly distributed on the nori, so literally the bottom 1 & 1/2 \" of the cone were empty - \u00a0just the nori. Most times when I've had spicy tuna the tuna is chopped and mixed with the sauce, but not always. Served this way, it was much harder to evenly distribute the spicy sauce to all the bites. Some were very spicy, some not at all. I unwrapped the roll to try and re-distribute the rice and sauce and was a little more successful, but feel it's a shame I should have to do this with a $5 hand roll. Really? You can't even put the rice to the bottom of the nori?? \u00a0I then ordered,against my typical preference, \u00a0a roll with tempura shrimp & avocado. It was tasty, but the pieces were very very large. I ate half of that, as I mentioned that fried anything in rolls really isn't my style. Finally, \u00a0finished with a sunset something-or-other roll. That one was the best, fresh salmon and tuna in very nice portions inside, and the finished that happily. The server was adequate, given how many patrons she had to cater to, though my water was completely empty and I had to flag her down for a refill. However, when seated at the sushi bar, I was forced to look at the dirty restaurant equipment, with the back stainless wall caked in splattered grease. The health food score in front showed the restaurant received a respectable 89, but I cannot see how based on what I saw yesterday. The floors are worn, servers overworked, and menu advertises items they do not carry. I've been to more than 30 sushi restaurants in and around Nashville and the immediate area. There are many restaurants less busy, with much better food and much more reasonable prices than Ru-San. \u00a0 You won't catch me at this one again.

Realistically, I have a hard time judging a restaurant by a lunch buffet, and I seldom encounter a \"good\" sushi buffet. This is sushi that is placed en masse on a line with an attempt to keep it fresh while it is exposed to the open air.I have been to Ru San's at least 5-6 times in the intervening years, and I have always had a pleasant experience. The sushi doesn't taste \"fishy\" which to me is indicative of bad fish. Yes, the menu is very extensive, but I will admit to loving very simple sushi. Their basic rolls contain a great deal of flavor. Admittedly, if you are a purist, you will HATE Ru San's. The restaurant blares a lot of music that one reviewer likened to DDR soundtracks. Ru San's is not an intimate setting. It is where you go for food as part of a night out on the town. I happen to love the up-tempo music, but it's not for everyone. Ru San's is a fusion restaurant so they have a wide assortment of sushi that is not fish-based. Their ginger simmered beef maki is delicious, but most would not consider anything with beef in it sushi. Their vegetable-based maki is also quite tasty. As I said, if you are a purist, you may very well find a visit to Ru San's disappointing or downright dreadful.I think my biggest criticism is a lack of updating. I first visited Ru San's in 2003, and as of last night's visit, 04/13/2012, I cannot notice any real updates. The seating is worn, and many of the booths have some jagged places where the faux-leather is cracked and broken.Their sake is fine, but you should seriously try the unfiltered sake. This will appear milky instead of the normal clear sake. This is served at room temperature which is indicative of its quality since sake is warmed to obscure its impurities. I have tried their pork katsu dan which I absolutely love so I would recommend branching off of their sushi menu. There will be hit or misses, but the same holds true for all restaurants. An appetizer not listed on their menu is the teriyaki rice ball. The rice is crisp on the outside with a teriyaki sauce over the top and served on a bed of carrot shavings. It used to be just $0.75, and I am sure the price has increased although I doubt it has increased dramatically. I did not read over the price tab last night since my partner had the check.It is very easy to run up a huge tab here, though, when you start adding in sake and non-sushi food items.

One look at the dish and I could tell it hadn't been prepared correctly. No flash frying and no baking - therefore not prepared as advertised, and the raw fish was old and chewy. All in all, she ate one piece, spit the other in her napkin and I sample 1/2 of a 3rd. \u00a0That's 2 1/2 pieces of the 5 on the plate (this comes into play in a second). The saba nigiri (salmon) was also not at all fresh - she had to pick it up with her hand and stretch and pull on it to rip it with her teeth. Being very disappointed in the dish, I notified the server that we would like to request that he take that single item off our ticket ($8.95). He refused, saying that if we ate more than 1/2 of the dish that they do not offer refunds. After an exchange with him, I asked to see the manager on duty who in this case happened to be a part owner of the restaurant. He was very rude and matter of fact in pointing out that, clearly marked on their menus, is a return policy stating that if you ate more than half your dish, you could not get a refund. To avoid a heated exchange, I paid for the item. After paying, I checked the menu for the refund policy. Nowhere on the menus is this information he quoted printed - as a matter of fact, refunds are ONLY available for food that is NOT PREPARED CORRECTLY. Also, we touched exactly 1/2 and not more (if we want to go with a technicality).Upon leaving, I approached the owner and took issue with his claimed refund policy on the menu. I asked him why he lied to me - He replied with \"We give NO refunds, no matter WHAT,\" thus contradicting even what WAS printed on their menu. Later that evening my girlfriend got sick from the food she ate. I ended up contesting the charge w/ American Express and had our total ticket refunded to me ($70)In a nutshell - rotten food, rotten people, rotten restaurant.", "location": "\nHendersonville, TN\n", "exp": " 6 reviews", "date": "2010-06-15"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nAlea H.\n", "review": "When I found out Nashville had a Ru Sans I almost pooped my pants...kinda not really.

Often times a long, long menu means you are attempting to do a lot of things that are \"ok\" rather than a few things that are great. That is the case here. The Sushi they have isn't mind blowing, its just \"pretty good\". My fave Sushi (in Nashville) is Samurai but thats another review. I am from a Coastal state, and I realize Nashville is not, so you can only expect so much from their sushi joints. I digress....Ru-San's is ok. The wait staff is mediocre at best, I think it's because they can't hear any thing you are saying over the ridiculously loud and obnoxious music they play constantly! I was SO annoyed the entire time I was there it was frustrating to order, and frustrating to attempt a conversation. I returned another night and we sat way in the back - mainly because we have kids and they apparently dont \"do\" the kid thing.

I'm an adult - make it dirrrrrty. \u00a0Like X-rated nassssty! \u00a0Oh well, I still drank it.So overall I had a fun experience and the food was good. \u00a0I can see coming back when I get the craving for a hibachi experience.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 1027 reviews", "date": "2011-06-27"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nKristin L.\n", "review": "Nice little Japanese Steak House.

It took a good 45 minutes of us being sat down at the table and eating before any staff EVER came to tell them to be quiet, and they didn't really even tell them to be quiet. It was just the bartender coming to tell them that they were cut off. So this upset the girls and they yelled and screamed for another 5 minutes or so, and then left on their own. Hopefully they weren't driving after that, but who knows. I was just very offended by the behavior and that no managers ever came to do anything about it.

I'm so glad that I finally did.Let me start with the service, about which I really can't say enough - the proprietor was right at the ordering window and made me feel instantly at home, even though I was only stopping in for carry-out. She was kind and gracious, and the rest of the staff was laughing, friendly, and constantly checked with me to ensure that I had already been helped.I got a pork shoulder sandwich, french fries, corn cakes. As for the pork shoulder sandwich, it came out very smokey (perfection!) tender, and flavorful: exactly what pork barbecue should look, taste, and smell like. The tangy orange-colored sauce wasn't what I was expecting for a Nashville barbecue restaurant, but boy, did it hit the spot. The french fries were glorious; hot, oily, and crispy. They had clearly just been fried when I got served up my extremely generous portion. The corn cakes were yet another wonderful surprise. I've always been a little suspicious of corn griddle cakes - simple skillet cornbread has always been the way to go for me - but these were phenomenal. That's not even to mention the fact that Miss Mary, the proprietor, gave me an extra corn cake free of charge simply for chatting with her! The cakes were well-done, savory, and chewy with a pleasingly gritty texture, just like Southern cornbread should be.I'll be back the next time I can.

I will focus on the pluses and minuses so you can make an informed decision.This was a family night out, and I have 4 children. Finding a table for all of us was a bit difficult, as it seems all of the tables are designed to fit four. After that, our server kept missing on nearly all cylinders which made it a drawn out experience with us reminding him many times of things that are missing. I am sure this is not always the case, but everything was moving in slow motion, on a night when slow motion was not my vibe.Dalton's is a bit weird in its layout, at least for a restaurant. Unlike Publicity, a few doors down, which is wider and shorter, Dalton's is very elongated. The trip to the bathroom, which is all the way in the back, feels like you are walking into the kitchen larder. There is a nice sized bar in the center of the establishment, which seemed to be a drawing place for some people I gathered as regulars (they knew the staff). It looks like they have some form of happy hour, as well, and I would guess at least one of the guests had been there since happy hour, as he was a few sheets to the wind. I don't take that out on the restaurant, just stating happy hour might be interesting to check out.The food is meat and three (or rather meat and two in most cases). Many of the items taste like they are poured out of cans without much additional prep. There are many other meat & three restaurants in the greater Nashville area, most of which are better, IMO.On the positive side, Dalton's is one of the more economical choices in Bellevue (other than Mexican or fast food) and has an extensive menu, a decent number of sides and a rotating specials menu. Talking to someone I knew who was leaving as we walked in, it is quite popular with the senior crowd. And, as it is one of a few restaurants in the immediate area that has the meat and three style. The only other homestyle American restaurant within a few miles at least, is Three Stones Pub, but their menu is not as extensive, either in menu or number of sides.Particulars: One of my daughter ordered the ribeye. It was okay, rather thin cut, and tasted a bit like it was marinated in beef broth to give it more flavor. But I guess steak is not the prime thing for a meat and three. I also tasted her cream corn, which was extremely bland. I had the Chicken Fried Steak. Standard frozen deep fried patty. The gravy was okay, which is a positive note. Green beans had a heavy canned taste. Wife said the Salmon was okay, but also commented on the green beans. The baked potato was a positive, although I am not a big fan of butter like spread in a small plastic cup, so I stole the real butter from the bread dish. Bread and corn cakes were probably the highlight of the meal, but we had to ask a few times to finally get them.I will talk to the seniors at church and see if there is any consensus on a favorite meal. If so, I may try back to see if we just ordered the \"wrong\" items.

Since autumn is my favorite season, let me write about the autumnal (what an awesome word) offerings: chocolate pumpkin muffins and the Cozy Sweater drink. The muffin is every bit as delicious as you're imaging. Get it warm. The drink is a comfy blend of coffee, cinnamon, spice and whipped cream. Perfect name for the drink, no? Stop in.

I arrived at the restaurant about 20 minutes after I called. The place is kind of small. It's sandwiched between two gas stations, the parking lot is always busy with cars moving to & from. Inside, it's your average pizza place. Looks like they have an areas set up for a lunch buffet. The place could use a little editing. A lot of random stuff around. There's a large office desk up from when you come in with two office chairs & junk on the desk. I walked up to the cashier & 3 employees were there talking about something. I stood there for about a minute until I was acknowledged. I gave the lady by debit card & she swiped it on an iPad & spun it around for me to sign & gave me my pizza. I got her (the pizza) home & was ready to dive in. My boyfriend is a food blogger & we happen to have a ruler in the kitchen, you know, as you do. Maybe the 12inX12in is a precooking size, because ours was 10.5in by 11in. We lost out on 28.5 square inches of pizza!! Anyway, back to the pizza. At first bite, I thought something was a little off. I love all pizza, thick, thin, regular, extra crust, not crust, but this was odd. I ate a couple slices and decided that it was maybe they use a butter spray to line the pan, that & it's cooked in a smokey oven, maybe? The bread of the crust didn't have much of a flavor but of the butter spray & a smoke flavor. Overall I wasn't that impressed with the pizza.

That certain subtle flavor that truly incredible pizza has, but for a buffet at $9 bucks and some change now you can't complain.

The pasta dishes aren't half bad either, but I recommend getting them to order instead of off the buffet, as well, it is buffet pasta. I could review the salad and dessert, but why? We are there for the pizza. The service is as expected, the Italo-hipsters are generally friendly but busy. Recently they remodeled and changed the layout of the buffet to accommodate more pizza and better customer flow.

There were two servers on and the restaurant appeared to still be picking up the pieces from a busy lunch. We asked to be seated outside, and every table was either seated or covered in the garbage left behind by parents with kids or groups of people having several beers. We ordered drinks and then our food, and waited probably 20 minutes to receive one small, thin crust pizza and the firecracker penne pasta. The pasta was sufficiently al dente, but the sauce was certainly more sweet than anything else; although there was a fair amount of Italian sausage and pepperoni in the dish, there was nothing that would inspire me to label it as a \"firecracker\". As a plus, the sauce appeared to be legitimately scratch made, there were considerable chunks of reduced tomato, albeit canned. The pizza was covered in cheese and toppings and the thin crust was quite crisp and flaky, my wife was thoroughly satisfied, although did question the value of the size and price equation.Considering what she was being asked to do, our waitress did an admirable job, but we definitely had to wait a bit to both request and then receive the check. Shortly before we received our food, it appeared there was a management shift change or perhaps a visit from the owner, because both servers and the duty manager came out and began to clean the wrecked patio. Just after we received our food, the server taking care of the table behind us came out the door with enough force to lose the pizza tray he was carrying and he dropped half a pizza on the floor. His reflexes were fairly quick, but the damage had been done, and I had a front row seat for the reaction from the table and the subsequent interactions with the manager. The restaurant handled it well from what I could tell, even though one of the guests was a bit prickly. Food+drinks+service+tax for this experience equaled just shy of 40 bucks.

When it first went in it was a hit! It has good, fresh food that doesn't make you feel sick after you eat it, like some pizza and Italian restaurants do. Even though a few select dishes are excellent, I think they could really step up their use of seasoning because the other dishes, even though they are fresh, could use a little more love from the chef who created the menu. They should have that certain unique punch that you can't get anywhere else which makes you crave it and want to come back and pay the prices they command. With regards to the decor, it's not bad. It's actually quite interesting and a great place for the family early on and a group of friends to gather or couples to go for date night.The biggest negative I personally give Pie In The Sky Lenox Village is the lack of attention to detail. Even though the place is clean and I have personally witnessed the managers hold the staff to their closing duties, the owners neglect to maintain the decor. There are marks on the wall and places that could use a little spackling. Let's be realistic...how much does it really cost to touch up a freaking wall of a place that makes you $? Also, there has been at least one lightening bolt decoration in the main dining room that has been out for about the last two years. Really? How much does that cost to replace? My guess is it's too cheap to ignore, but yet the owner has had time to hang up beer neon signs which are really tacky for the type of establishment Pie is geared for. Don't get me wrong, I like going out for a little late night bar crawl from time to time, but Pie is not it. They close early and appear to get most of their business from families, early dinner parties, and date night couples, not bar goers. I'm sure anyone who drives by pie knows it serves a reasonable selection of beers. Marketing the bar isn't really that necessary, IMO. My last biggest annoyance is the floors, especially the concrete. When Pie first opened it had a nice finished concrete floor, now it is so worn out, it's pretty much raw...ugly...concrete. In the past ~5 - 6 years \u00a0that Pie has been opened, the floors have never been refinished or recovered. At least the kitchen floors look great, but I just can't understand why this has been neglected. I can't understand why businesses don't realize that letting things go often shows sign of a failing place and people don't want to come back and be a part of that. If you want to command premium pizza prices then you have to create and maintain a premium experience! It's pretty simple.Ok, I am done ranting about the negatives, so I will finish with my overall review. I recommend this place. The food is good, the staff is friendly and above average on service. The prices are a tad above what you may expect but are still reasonable. The place is clean and it has a great patio, so you won't be disappointed. I just hope the owners are reading this and will update/maintain the restaurant better than they are doing.

Your habits just change, you know? Also, I cut dairy out of my diet so pizza joints aren't my favorite place to go anymore, hah.Anyway, the food here used to be incredible all the time. Like every single time I ate here, the food was fantastic-everything I had was perfect...but then I went back after a while and I noticed the food started to get a little bipolar on the quality. I've never had anything flat out terrible here, but you notice when your food isn't what it used to be.My favorite dishes here are their BBQ Chicken pizza, the BBQ Chicken hoagie, their meat lasagna makes my soul sing (at least the last time I had it, which has been a while ago now), the pepperoni pizza, and the Spiral Breadsticks are awesome, but sometimes there isn't enough cheese in it. Also, the \"grilled cheese\" sandwich for kids is something I used to get alllllll the time. I'm starting to drool just thinking about it now...alas, no more cheese for me *sigh*.Service is pretty darn good every time I go here, no complaints. I don't drink in restaurants hardly at all so I can't say anything about their bar, but they do have 3 TV's up there if anyone wants to know...or they did the last time I went in.As for the prices here, I do happen to know they use more gourmet ingredients than your typical pizza joints, but food prices are on the rise anyway so yeah...not much you can do about that. Some other people have pointed this out, but despite the fact that their speciality pizzas are a little pricey, if you split it between three or four people the cost is pretty reasonable. Plus, I don't think they charge for refills so yay!It can be a little annoying when there are kids running around, but that is the fault of the parents not paying attention. They do have the \"dough bar\", but kids even find ways to get wild and crazy with the dough; they start throwing it against the windows and if you're walking by, it may bounce off the glass and hit you (I've seen it happen).P.S.

From my first visit in November, the staff has been friendly, the lattes have been quality for the price, and the location cannot be beat. The coffee drinks are standard variety - Lattes, Cappuccinos, Mochas, etc. - but they are well-made with Vienna Roasters beans and capable baristas. The baked goods are tasty, and while I haven't yet tried their lunch offerings, word on the street is that they hold the line well.My one wish with this shop is that they might somehow create a space for live acoustic music on Friday and/or Saturday evenings. The location and layout of the room would be perfect for a singer with an acoustic guitar to play. There's a ton of musicians in Lenox Village that might welcome an opportunity to play close to home (me included).

The place is just around the corner of Broadway, so people are everywhere. If they get repeat business, it means they are good and not just lucky to be where they are. \u00a0I usually don't do many reviews, but I did want Luigi's to know that they are lucky to be where they are. \u00a0Sure, the food was great and the staff was good (to my face), but even great food is not enough to keep the doors open and the management needs to learn that.  While eating, we observed the place was a lot like Mafiosa's on 12th Ave. \u00a0It will not have the same crowd, but it stays open late, it's a place people will go to do a lot of drinking while eating, and it's loud. \u00a0However, this place is much louder than Mafiosa's. For that reason alone, this is NOT a place for a family dinner. But they are not trying to be Pizza Hut. \u00a0They have a small dance floor area and it is much more of a bar than Mafiosa's would ever consider being. \u00a0We ordered meatball's as an appetizer. \u00a0They were served with a lot of sauce which was both tasty and useful for dipping our pizza crust in. I think the meatballs are better than Mafiosa's and the pizza was as comparable as well. \u00a0Another similarity between Luigis and Mafiosa's is that their bathrooms are not up to par. \u00a0HOWEVER, Louigi's bathroom was MUCH MUCH worse than anything I have seen in a restaurant that looked so nice from the outside. \u00a0Clearly, no one from the place checked the restrooms since lunch. \u00a0There were no paper towels in either dispenser. \u00a0There were plenty of them on the floor, sink, and urinal. There were empty beer bottles on counters and here and there. \u00a0This looked worse than many college bar restrooms at MTSU. \u00a0If any of the cooks used the bathroom, I bet they did not wash their hands. \u00a0The counter was soaked with water. \u00a0There was hardly a dry spot on the floor. \u00a0I don't have a clue what the toilets looked like, but I would bet the floor was wet and who knows what the seats would look like? \u00a0I was very irritated about it and as I walked out, I saw a fat lady in her late 30's who looked as though she may have been a supervisor of some sort. \u00a0I asked to speak to a manager and she said she served as one and could help. \u00a0I told her the bathroom was totally unacceptable and some of the reasons why. \u00a0She said she would send someone to look into it and I walked away. \u00a0My wife saw me talking to her and asked what the problem was. \u00a0Apparently, as I walked away, the fat lady was making faces behind my back and her body language indicated to my wife that this lady was dismissive of my concerns while talking to another employee. \u00a0Apparently the fat lady did not know my wife saw all that. \u00a0We decided that we would not let this ruin our dining experience. \u00a0But then my wife went to the bathroom before we left. \u00a0She came out a bit upset too. \u00a0I sent her in to take pictures, but it was too dark and crowded to take good photos. \u00a0The women's bathroom was trashed and the soap dispenser was off the wall and sitting on the countertop. \u00a0I don't guess the female employees wash their hands either.If you want great food in a convenient location (assuming you are already downtown on foot) then this is a decent choice. \u00a0The food was great. \u00a0The price is what you'd expect to pay at this location. \u00a0But if you go, be sure to use the bathroom somewhere else first.", "location": "\nHendersonville, TN\n", "exp": " 6 reviews", "date": "2014-09-07"}, {"rating": "2.0", "name": "\nJim R.\n", "review": "good service nothing to brag about here.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 62 reviews", "date": "2014-05-04"}, {"rating": "1.0", "name": "\nM Q.\n", "review": "Should have looked at the reviews before we said \"let's get some pasta\".....

He had pitchers of water as well as sweet and un-sweet tea on the tables and brought out plenty of glasses. That was a wonderful move! We really appreciated that.

It was brought out about 10 min after everyone else's and it was cold. Matt removed it from our bill and I was fine with that. I did have a delicious side ceasar salad and enjoyed it.

Here at La Hacienda and many other Nashville Mexican restaurants, the sopapillas resemble more of a simple fried tortilla topped with honey and cream (in the style of tortas fritas, which are more South American than Mexican).

Most of the time when I am hungry and not exactly sure what I want for dinner, I settle on tacos, burritos or enchiladas. It is the comfort food that I never had growing up. For some strange reason, my family never ate at Mexican restaurants. It wasn't until High School that I discovered the pure magic that is re-fried beans.

The space is large and bright. The service is friendly and fast. The margaritas are enormous, and the food is good. They have a variety of food, ranging from the familiar chicken quesadillas to the more adventurous tripe tacos (my absolute favorite thing in the world).I'm on a personal mission to find the best tripe taco in Nashville. If you are new to this blog and don't know about my predilection for all the \"gross\" parts of the animal, I apologize. But I love to eat the stuff that most people find too gross. La Hacienda makes, hands down, the best tripe taco I have had in Nashville. The tripe is fried crispy, but still retains the soft chewy goodness. I feel that most people fry the S#*& out of it and it ends up tasting like burnt bacon. But really good tripe is heaven! I also had a beef tongue taco and a cheese enchillada. The enchillada was just OK, but the tongue was great. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that La Hacienda shines in the taco department.Oh and the chips?! They have really good fresh fried chips with some tasty salsa. Their salsa is just a bit more spicy than your average table offerings. All things considered, I really like this place.

The first time we went was for 16th district Margarita Mondays but we came a bit earlier since we were already over that way. During their happy hour I was told the margaritas were buy one get one free. I tried to order a frozen strawberry margarita but our server told us that wasn't part of happy hour and was extra. I told him that was fine and he kept going off about something so I settled on a regular frozen margarita. I think the language barrier is what stopped me from having my strawberry margarita. I could barely understand my first server and I honestly think he couldn't understand me. I had to point to what I wanted on the menu.Second time around, I had family in town and they wanted late night Mexican so we ended up here. Our server was very sweet and chatty but not as attentive as I would've liked. I had to go to the front desk and tell them we were ready to order. I decided on a pollo loco which is grilled chicken with a jalapeno cheese sauce. My daughter had something similar but wanted to add rice and beans. Our server told her she couldn't do it and to try something else. We tried explaining back to her that it was a different item altogether that she was suggesting and we were willing to pay extra for substituting. She said she didn't know if she could do it so I told her I was positive that she could and I would wait while she asked the manager. She came back and said it wouldn't be a problem. When our order came out, the cheese on the chicken was not like the picture at all. It was very watered down and the chicken was dry. Everyone that ordered chicken (most of our party) had the same complaint. When our server came back, I explained that there was hardly any jalapeno cheese on my chicken and could I get a small side.

I was hoping all the great reviews from some of my friends indicated a transformation of this place. La Hacienda has enjoyed a long tenure as one Nashville's most beloved \"authentic\" cocina de Mexicano...because of tenure, IMHO. I moved here from the West Coast where we picked up our food from the homes of old ladies from Mexico throwing down enchiladas, chili colorado, tamales, chili verde, and stuffings for tacos. When we arrived here in the early 80s there was one joint down on Murf Road across from Channel 2 and then a spot on Nolensville Road, and then La Hacienda, and then Las Palmas...and...and...well, never mind about the history of Mexican food in Nashville. I learned many years ago that La Hacienda wasn't up to par with what should be considered \"good\" Mexican food and things haven't changed. La Hacienda's food is mediocre at best. The enchilada sauce tastes like it comes from a can which is a sin. The fajitas while meaty, lack the depth of seasoning and the caramelization that should come from proper searing (the same goes for the onions, peppers, and tomatoes served with the meat). The street taco in the form of chicken was not very good due to the bland flavor. Oh, the rice was boring as all get out but included peas and carrots and the refried beans lacked any creaminess or flavor. Some good news about the food, the carne asada tacos were good with salsa. The cheese dip was room temp, but had a nice flavor without any spice. The table salsa was canned tomato with some fresh onion, cilantro and chili and was a good for eating with the nice chips (thick). The ambience has nice murals of typical Mexican story telling. The tables and chairs are in the Equipale fashion with wood frames covered in leatheresque material. I'm a sucker for cool chairs and tables. The big draw back is that the overhead canned lighting is blaring fluorescent bulbs. Nothing makes people's skin tone look worse than the green cast from the unflattering bulbs. Additionally, it's cast produces a cold vibe and just lame. The mediocre food , the poor lighting, and over-hyped sensation of Nashville's \"BEST\"...and it's unmerited popularity among non-hispanics...this place is a bummer. The silver lining...they do serve Las Paletas out of a help yourself freezer by the cashier.

By many accounts, La Hacienda is the best eating experience if you're after Mexican food that's not smothered in queso (not that there's anything wrong with queso)!Just not by my account as it turns out, because my recent trip to La Hacienda was bland and disappointing. The thing I love about Mexican food is its bright fresh flavors, and unfortunately these were utterly lacking in the dishes I ordered. I am a lover of lengua (tongue) and tripe tacos, so I ordered one of each, along with an \"al pastor\" (spicy pork) sope. Of the three items, the sope was the best, but both the tongue and tripe were pretty flavorless, tasting kind of gamey, but other than that, not like much of anything. The al pastor was unoffensive, but also not memorable. My husband ordered the chorizo burrito, and it was WAY too salty... also, his burrito was simply chorizo and a few measly chunks of avocado... no rice, no beans, nothing else. Rather than layers of flavor, this was just one solid wall of salt.Three-stars because this place is serving up the ghost of authentic Mexican food, and it's nice for people to see that you can get something other than chimichangas (though they have those too). Unfortunately the quality just wasn't there. If you look around the restaurant, it's mostly filled with gringos, many of whom I suspect are ordering the more Americanized offerings. If you're really jonesing for a sope, come here I guess, but otherwise you are much better off going to El Tapatio (3611 Nolensville Pike) which is so delicious and also offers birria! You may have to pantomime along with your English to be understood as it mostly caters to non-English speakers, but it is so worth it!All told, the best thing I had here was the corn popsicle from Las Palletas that they were selling by the cash register.

I think this stems from the expectations that we Nashville diners have from a Mexican restaurant.

Here you will find tacos that are resplendent in their simplicity: meat, (steak or chicken) onions, cilantro, lime. Note that there is no cheese, lettuce, or sour cream to dull the flavors. If you want fantastic shrimp cocktails, fish tacos, or ceviche, eat here. Contrary to other opinions, I say La Hacienda is a fine place for a first or second date, having actually done that.

You can get your hopes up because the place has the same name and is in the same location and is almost the same looking from the outside and practically identical in the inside (so much so it's like walking into a time-warp).I grew up on Obie's pizza and started coming as a baby in the 1980s. My parents were Obie's fanatics and were always there from the time it first opened in about 1979. The originator of the place was a young guy who was killed unexpectedly shortly after it opened. Obie's changed hands many times after that but the new operators always remained true to the original recipe. The place was called Obie's Flying Tomato Pizza back then. They served thin crust, pan, and deep dish Chicago style pizzas.All of us were such Obie's lovers that even though we moved away in the early 90's when any of us came back to Nashville we'd always bring several pizzas back on the plane (when you were allowed to do that sort of thing) for the rest of the family. The last time I did that was about 2001. A year of so after that we got a call from my aunt to forewarn us that Obie's had changed owners yet again and this time the pizza changed too.I decided to stop by recently even though I'd been told by other family who checked out the change not to go because there is no way I would like it they said. I couldn't resist the temptation. The owner was there and I just came out and asked him if his pizza was anything at all like the original Obie's. He said he wouldn't know because he never had the original Obie's but to please go ahead and try his. He also said the current Obie's pizza was a recipe he created.

My sister in-law suggested making a reservation since the wait is apparently long all of the time. She was right, 1 hour, 15 minutes. I would definitely make sure you have a reservation. Despite having a reservation, we still waited about 30 minutes for a seat. They don't have the typical buzzing circles that alert you to your awaiting table, they text you. The nice thing is, they're in the mall, so you can walk around a bit plus they have a very interactive store where you can shop around while you wait. Our table of six was seated at the back right of the restaurant between the kitchen entrance and the bathroom entrance next to the Tiger Family display. Not an idea place to sit. Every 1-3 minutes someone is coming out screaming 'Volcano\" or singing Happy Birthday to a guest. If possible, you might consider requesting another seat. The ordering process is easy enough. The waitress seemed to really know what was on the menu & was confident in her suggestions. The restaurant seemed to be out of at least one ingredient for every drink my husband tried to order. As a side note, their mixed drinks are quite week. Might be best to stick with beer/wine. It's a very nice touch to get to keep the glass though! My husband and brother both got a rib meal that neither seemed to really enjoy. I had a primavera that wasn't too great, just too much oil.

The fish and chips are great. I almost always get the chicken Bamba's barbecue wrap. It is soooo good. Very different flavour. I normally hate raw onions (especially red onions, ugh) but they work in this dish and couldn't imagine asking them to leave them off. The barbecue sauce is a little smoky and a little fruity, very nice. Love the addition of cilantro too, it just makes for a totally different dish you can't get anywhere else. Plus, it's HUGE. When you get it, it looks okay. But trust me, you can't finish it (or at least I never can). You'll either need to split it with someone or get a doggy bag.I don't get to go as often as I'd like so I've not been able to try everything, but they do have some stuff that you can't get at other places, at least not at other chain restaurants, like macadamia crusted tilapia, dynamite scallops, and their Tuscan chicken.Their service is great, and the ambiance is nice.

I ordered chips and salsa - the chips were fresh, hot and very good. The salsa looked appealing but surprisingly, it did not have much flavor. It tasted like tomato-based water. I also ordered the chicken bang bang tacos. Again, very appealing on the plate but sadly lackluster in taste. There was just not enough flavor/seasoning in the dishes I ordered.The staff was polite enough. A waitress took our order and a waiter brought out my food. The silverware did not look very clean. The bill was a little over $16 (closer to $20 w/tip) Overall, my 1st impression wasn't a really good one. However, I'm giving 3 stars because a friend wanted to try it out so I went back for a 2nd lunch. The blackened grilled chicken sandwich was very good. It was flavored nicely and the chicken was cooked perfect. The battered fries were good. Sandwhich was large in size - they could have added a few more fries but it was still very fulfilling. The bill for this lunch was a little over $12 (closer to $16 w/tip).I will give this restaurant more tries.

Because I heart this place so hard that I can't make sense of how people can feel so negatively. So first I will acknowledge what I think *are* real problems here: 1) The Setup. Yes, it's confusing. Yes, there has to be a better way. It would make much more sense to have one register for the custom food orders and another for coffee and baked goods. But wait! There is! Only thing is, it's not always open and it's still pretty damn confusing which one you should go to.2) The Coffee. It's terrible. I've gotten coffee here a couple of times, once regular coffee, another time a latte. Once my friend ordered a chai and I ordered a soy latte, and we seriously couldn't tell the difference between them. I don't know how this is possible. They have a big fancy espresso machine back there, but it seems like maybe they're using coffee beans to make espresso? Who knows. I suggest you stick with tea, water, or soda. Regular coffee if you must. It says online that they use Bongo Java. I'm going to have to try it again, as I've gotten it at the end of the day, and perhaps it was bad because it was sitting there too long.But now, on to what this place is best at: FOOD.Their breakfast sandwiches are ginormous and so damn tasty. You can custom build them on croissants, bagels, or any of their fresh baked breads. It's $5.50. This might seem expensive for two ingredients, except when you realize that it's 2 ingredients *in addition to* eggs (and you can get egg whites no extra charge).The breakfast choice FTW, though, is the french toast. People, this is the best french toast I have had in my entire life, and a ton of food for its $7.19 price, which is totally reasonable for a breakfast entree. If you don't want one of the main breakfast things, you can't go wrong with their baked goods. Everything I've had has been incredible, including their desserts. As far as the lunch options, the sandwiches are killer. To be honest, I've only ever had the farm bread, because it's so amazing I can't bring myself to order anything else. I crave the Fresh Mozzarella sandwich all the time, and that's my default order, but the Boulder Veggie is also good. And they do a 1/2 sandwich + soup or salad special, which is a little cheaper and still plenty filling. I would very much like to disagree with statements made about their food not being higher quality than places like Panera. For me, the difference is night and day. Bread & Co is high quality, with the focus on freshness, rather than completely shorting out your system by loading on as many flavors as possible. I would never choose Panera or Provence over Bread & Co.A great option they have is their grab-and-go case, which stocks tons of sandwiches so you can cut out part of the waiting. Sadly I've never seen the Fresh Mozzarella in the prepared sandwich case. If they sold it that way, I'd probably be running in to grab and go far more often. I definitely recommend this place for brunches or late/early lunch and dinner. It can get very crowded with students around lunch, since it accepts Commodore Cash.The most prohibitive thing about Bread & Co is the parking situation. This lot just isn't big enough for the amount of businesses here. If you can find street or meter parking, I recommend that.

The first register had 4 people in line, but only 1 person was paying for herself. The other 3 were just extra warm bodies making the line longer than it needed be. So, it turned out that the first register nearest the entrance is where I should go to order a breakfast sandwich.

Definitely pricey -- over $10 for a multigrain bagel with chive cream cheese, a reasonable serving of lox, capers, onions, and diced cucumbers and tomatoes. It was served open-faced, which is probably a good thing since the capers and various veggies will start rolling out. And stupid me, I forgot to ask what kind of lox they use. Apparently, as of a few days ago, there is a recall of Vita Nova salmon, due to potential lysteria contamination. The coffee was smooth. Did not give me a stomachache, which means that it was not strong. In total, I spent $13+ for a bagel with lox combo and coffee. It's the amount I expected to pay at a Marriott/Hyatt/Hilton room service breakfast. Even back in San Francisco, the last time I ordered a similar meal, it was only $7 and change (and instead of coffee I had a cafe au lait and they piled on the lox).I might come back someday to try out their cookies and pastries.

It's a good local restaurant but nothing spectacular.

I always opt for an omelet (you can choose three fillings at the base price), but the pastries and muffins have also gotten high marks from my dining companions.During lunch there are pre-made sandwiches and salads available in the fridge in the back.

I've been a customer going on two years now, but just before that I worked there as well - for all of 5 days. I'll say as an employee, this place blows. They've got a small-time corporate attitude and run a much tighter ship than i'm willing to tolerate. That being said, I'm also a slacker who's been fired from way more jobs than he can count. So take that for what it's worth.However, as an employee, even during such a short stint - being the utter opportunist and free-food-glutton I am - I had the joy of sampling a great deal of things on the menu. The soups, the salads, the deli items (try the chicken tenders cold) - i don't think i ever tasted anything there that wasn't awesome.As a customer, i pretty much always get the same thing and will say with the utmost certainty that if it's a curried chicken salad sandwich on cranberry pecan bread with lettuce, tomato, avacodo spread, sprouts, pesto mayonnaise, and kettle chips you're after - there is no better place in Nashville to get it. One of the reasons I probably hated working there so much is that at B&C, quality is job #1. the bread, veggies, meats, coffee, etc, etc, etc are always fresh. Every inch of that place is cleaned and scrubbed every night. The food is above all both tasty and healthy, but by no means cheap. This ain't Subway, and you're not getting a $5 footlong. A sandwich, drink, chips, and a cookie may set you back about $13. Should this deter you? Only if you're having trouble making rent. Otherwise, splurge a little.

Of my two rolls, I wasn't that happy with either. They were edible and I didn't get ill but I had higher expectations in my head.* My dragon roll was a bit tough/chewy and my scallop roll was fishy. Before I opened the container, I could smell it. Not my finest moment in deciding to eat it but I was coming off a particularly busy week (Friday night) and I was ravenously hungry. Know that you have better options, Nashville. Let people do what they do best and keep it moving.
