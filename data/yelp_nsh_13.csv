"406 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"I used to love Panera which I don't know why. The only thing I constantly order from Panera is their medeteranian egg white breakfast sandwich but a couple of months ago, they changed the recipe. It used to have sundried tomatoes. Now, it has seasoned chopped tomatoes with maybe sundried tomato paste. Either way, Panera isn't all that.It's super expensive for what you get. Sure, it might be a healthier alternative than others but there are so many other alternatives like Newks which serves the same type of food. Better tasting and better price for the amount of food that you get.This location specifically is right next to Vanderbilt so it is constantly busy especially during lunch. The workers work fast and hard though so you really don't have to wait that much long.

Ordered the Southern Chicken Flatbread with corn chowder. I really like their corn chowder.

"406 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"I'm not a Vanderbilt student, but I'd imagine that I'd spend a lot of time here if I was. If you've been to a Panera before, I'll keep this review brief and say upfront that it's basically on par with any of their other locations.If you haven't been before, think of Panera as your typical cafe, in the same 'genre' of 'upscale fast food' as Cosi, Au Bon Pain, Starbucks, and the like. It's a very comfortable, relaxing place to grab a quick lunch, catch up with friends, or camp out with books and a laptop to get work done over a few hours. The wi-fi works great, and there's plenty of outlets if you need to bunker down for a while.The food at Panera is also pretty great, and pricing is a tad high but generally agreeable. The best option is the ""Pick Two,"" where you can combine a half-sandwich with a soup or salad to get the most variety out of the menu. I also love the quiches, though you have to get there before 11am for that. It's nice that they rotate their menu pretty frequently; I'll visit Panera every few weeks, and there's often a new addition or two to the menu.

"406 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"You know, I think the last time I went to Panera was around a 1.5 years ago... maybe longer? There are just so many great spots in town to get a sammich, salad, and soup so I put 'ol Panera on the backburner. However, thanks to our chilly and stormy weather of the last 2 days, I was feeling a bit apprehensive about which of the following:A. Leaving my bedB. Getting out of my car to face the cold wet precipitation C. Wearing head to to flannel (i.e. I was wearing my damn pajamas outside of my home - but I had on a long winter coat!)D. All of the aboveIf you said, you're likely a brilliant mind and have earned the spot of being my one call if I was ever in a pinch during my appearance as a contestant on a gameshow that allows me to do so. Just sayin'. I felt a bit guilty since I'm hypersensitive about supporting local businesses year round and we're right in the middle of this Yelp Shops Local campaign, but this broad was craving som comforting soup and a little carbs. I was bored with what was in my pantry and I happened to be nearby at the Post Office to use the drive-up mailbox since apparently my mail carrier hasn't grasped the concept of picking up my mail but instead shoves my magazines and other parcel on top... sorry, that is a whole other Yelp review. So. I gave in. I pulled up in the drive-thru line as apparently I shared the same sentiment as everyone else in Nashville and I waited. Anyone, who knows me will laugh at this because I become a complete brat when it comes to lines and am overall, I'm not exactly known for my patience.... Question 2: So what do I suck up and do it for? Answer: A Mediterranean Veggie Sandwich, Iced Green Tea, and a cup of theBlack Bean Soup (along with a bag of chips and chunk of bread that came with my order)Question 3: And, you know what? Answer: It was damn tasty! I enjoyed each and every last bite. The experience as a whole was very positive. From the drive-thru line moving efficiently to the extremely friendly (but not in the annoying way) drive-thru service, this location is very good at what they do. I'm appreciative of that and also due to the fact that I didn't even have to change out of my PJs to get a healthy and delicious meal.

"406 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Sometimes you have a love/hate relationship with a place.I love Panera as a rule... I realize to a lot of yelpers out there, it's not ""cool"" to review chain places.  I understand one location to the next is not often relevantly different, but I don't limit myself to only writing about the unique.This Panera location has one huge attribute:  a drive thru.It also has one huge downfall:  the drive thru.Parking here is scarce, I don't care when you go.  Years ago this parking lot connected to an alley in the back, and there was this overflow lot than Panera shared with Starbucks next door.  Alas, no more.  The alley now is separated from the Panera lot by concrete and medians, and when they're full, you are basically out of luck.It's a huge plus to be able to go thru a drive thru in this area and get a panini and soup for lunch rather than a burger and fries - and everybody knows it.  Their drive thru line will flow along the outer parking lot ""rim"" if you will, and folks scoping for parking will follow around and park adjacent to the drive thru lane of traffic squished (illegally) to the right.  Makes getting out that way a big hot mess if you're not in the actual drive-thru, warning.Also that overflow lot I mentioned from earlier?  If you circle the black the long way, it's still there, only now it's fenced and a Central Parking System pay $1 for 15 minutes.  And the wandering meter maid, trust me, she's close.  A little frustrating, but if you've got a hankering and no other choice, do it and just be careful in the alley - a little muddy and ""rutty.""This Panera is one of the worst for finding seats during lunch, makes you glare at the folks taking up booths with their laptops and day's worth of reading all spread out when you're carrying a tray wandering.  But I get that Panera is open way more hours than just lunch, so they're allowed.  Just glaring...My only real Panera issue that I just recently figured out, and it's small... when you order your entree, a Pick 2 would be my norm, you see all the info about add a bakery treat for 99 cents.  In the small print that I just noticed, you have to buy a drink.  If you are opting to drink more water, as my doctor suggested I try - and it's been working pretty well for weight loss - you pay bakery treat retail.Now, I fully admit that drinking water for weight loss and adding a cookie is counter productive.  And I fully realize that restaurants make the hugest part of their profits on drink sales as opposed to the food.  But I swear I never noticed that caveat before - maybe it's just me.",Panera Bread,6153201500,299 reviews,2013-01-09,"Franklin, TN",/biz/panera-bread-nashville-2,3.0,40,"Nashville, TN",Sarah B.

"406 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"I usually go to the Panera Bread on Commerce Street in Nashville near my job at the Bat Building for AT&T, but I had to go to the Doctor's office for my surgery at Vanderbilt and Tony had never eaten at Panera Bread before, so we chose this location.It is a great size and it has a great parking lot in size but it is so tight and always so full.

"406 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"I usually go with the Pick Two option and order the Chicken Cuban Panini and either the French Onion Soup or the Asian Sesame Salad. The panini is on a nicely pressed piece of focaccia, and has ham, Swiss, sliced chicken breast, sweet and spicy pickles, and a really good chipotle mayo and sun-dried tomato ale mustard spread that makes this one of my favorite sandwiches here. The French Onion Soup is always really yummy, rich, and brothy. My only complaint is that they forget the little bag of seasoned croutons and cheese that go with it way too often. Come on, guys! This part is what makes it so good! The Asian Sesame Salad is simple, but one of my favorite salads. It has chicken breast, romaine lettuce, fresh cilantro, sliced almonds, sesame seeds, crispy wonton strips &  reduced-sugar Asian sesame vinaigrette. For the most part, I like this location fine for using the drive thru, but I would probably not choose to park and go in because the parking lot always seems to be chaotic and a high risk for a fender bender. The customer service is probably more of a 3.5 because of the above-mentioned missing croutons and cheese and a sense of being a little scattered at times.

"406 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"This Panera is similar to SATCo next door. They need new management and employees who actually want to be there.

"406 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"I have been visiting Panera for years with my Sister as our ""Friday lunch date spot"", mainly because my Sister is a picky eater who is hesitant to try new things, and it's sort of become a tradition if you will. We decided about 2 years ago this location was in the ""middle"" between both of our jobs, so we meet here. Worst part of that plan: parking. It is an utter nightmare and I am not exaggerating. They have a security/parking person onsite, but honestly they can't create more parking spaces....they only help you squeeze in when the spaces are taken and you have to park on a curb. It appears much of the Vandy crowd comes in for lunch, and that is wonderful for all of us because many of them walk. That also makes it incredibly crowded and nearly impossible to find a seat. What's worse is the few people who sit there for wi-fi usage while others wanting to eat lunch have to table stalk until they can sit and eat. My Sister orders the same sandwich and the mac n cheese every time. We love the bread, love the mac n cheese. I typically get the over priced Mozzarella and Tomato Panini with the greek salad -  the pick two combo, I do enjoy the sandwich but it is not loaded with cheese like you might find in a real sandwich shop. I do agree with some of the reviewers that the portions are small for the price, and the customer service is inconsistent. I expect to pay a little more if the food is organic, purchased in smaller portions or locally but this is a chain. As far as service goes: for about a year we knew several of the cashiers, they remembered us and some times our orders every time, but they have moved on, possibly graduated and moved into careers. Since then it has been hit or miss with service. We visited today and our cashier was incredibly friendly and engaging so that was a ""hit"" and deserves recognition. I do love Panera's Hazelnut coffee, I often stop in to a nearby Panera when out to enjoy one, their pastries are also delicious. I just won't go out of my way to come here.

They were brewing the Cafe Kaldi on the morning of my visit. The decaf roast available in 12 ounce bags says ""natural"" process, which I'm assuming is Swiss water process, for those who care about less chemicals in your food. Hubby had a decaf Americano and pronounced it excellent. I had a bagel breakfast sandwich~eggs, cheese and sliced tomato (I skipped the bacon) on a sesame bagel, and found it quite tasty, although it lacked seasoning and needed salt & pepper. I asked the barista where the bagels were made, and while she couldn't remember the name of the bakery, she said they were local. They wouldn't win any awards in NYC, but it was a decent bagel. Muffins, pastry, specialty coffee drinks and tea are also available. They serve ice cream and sorbet also, and, while I did not partake, I noticed that this is a local and carefully sourced product made from hormone free dairy. Soon I hope this will be the norm and not notable at all; until then, I applaud all businesses that make the right decision and care for their customers in this way.

"1609 Murfreesboro PikeNashville, TN 37217",3.5,"It sucks to say, but Nashville has ridiculously awful Asian food and that's evident in the reviews that this place is getting.  Kobe serves up painfully mediocre food from a menu that's so all over the place, it can only be described as a hot mess.First of all, go look at a map of Asia.  Japan, Thailand, and China are in entirely different geographical regions and with entirely different climates and hence totally different cuisines.  I don't understand why restaurants continue to lump Japanese and Thai food together.  They are COMPLETELY different.I played it safe for lunch and ordered the chicken teriyaki.  The chicken itself was extremely dry and the sauce thoroughly disappointing...yet another place that chooses to use teriyaki from the jar instead of just making it themselves.  Seriously?  Teriyaki sauce is like 6 ingredients that EVERY Asian kitchen has anyway.  The veggies on the bottom were just flat.  Asian preparation for veggies involves a screaming hot wok or pan that allows the edges of the veggies to get slightly charred while the inside is still crisp.  My veggies tasted like they came straight out of a steamer bag in the microwave.The lunch came with an egg roll and egg drop soup...which is hilarious.  Egg drop soup is Chinese...I thought we were in a Thai/Japanese restaurant?  The soup also featured carrots and peas.  Um, OK.My boyfriend had the chirashi which he also said was just meh.  The fish was fresh but the sushi chef didn't know how to slice raw fish.  The pieces of fish were broken and bruised.  It was as if the chef applied too much pressure trying to hold the fish while slicing.  Amateur knife work.My coworker wanted steak but regrettably did not opt for the NY Strip hibachi.  His so-called steak hibachi came back extremely dry and hard to eat.  It was also gray and did not look like steak.Overall, a very disappointing lunch and we will not be back.  Rule of thumb: don't go to sushi/Thai restaurants.  They ALL suck no matter where you are.

I few weeks ago I finally decided to try them after hearing good reviews from people in my community.  I went over their Menu item by item online so I would be familiar with all of their choices and could place my order quickly.  I had been sick with whatever was going around right before Christmas 2013 and definitely wanted Soup and Tempura.  So I ordered he Tom Yum Soup with Shrimp and Mixed Tempura.The soup arrived immediately and boy was I surprised.  It was very good but very spicy and hot.  I laughed that the Chili Oil would delete whatever germs I had left in my system.  The Tempura arrived shortly and the sweet dipping sauce was a great counter agent to the Soup.The place is not fancy buy any means, but was clean and that is what matters to me most.  I will definitely go back and see how their Sushi and Sashimi is.  I am so glad we have this Restaurant in our area.",Kobe Asian Restaurant,6153608313,25 reviews,2014-01-21,"Nashville, TN",/biz/kobe-asian-restaurant-nashville,5.0,47,"Nashville, TN",Betty T.

"1609 Murfreesboro PikeNashville, TN 37217",3.5,"My mother and I decided to go have sushi the other night, and we made the wrong decision in going to Kobe. When we arrived, the location was first a little difficult to get to and then it seemed a bit sketchy.The real issues didn't come until we got into the building though. When we were seated, there were only a handful of people waiting on to-go orders and one table occupied while all of the other booths had dirty dishes on them. We had been seated for fifteen minutes before anyone came to even ask for a drink order, and remember, the restaurant was almost completely empty.  At the time of placing our drink order, we also ordered an appetizer.Now, if there were a bunch of people in the location, I would have understood some of the other issues we had. Like, we then saw two other groups seated, and they had their drink orders taken. Then the waitress took their actual orders, and walked past my mother and I as we had our menus closed and our order form on the edge of the table. A major issue that we had with Kobe though came from the sushi chef. We saw him touch multiple doors and items that others had touched without gloves on, including placing his open palm against the door to the kitchen, and then go back to making orders without changing his gloves. He also was spending a lot of time standing around doing nothing letting to-go orders pile up, some of which had been there when we sat down that he didn't even work on when we decided to leave.The restaurant also needs to change some of the things on the menu. We tried to order sake but were told that they didn't have the license for it.By the time we left, it had been forty minutes, and we never even got our appetizer.Don't waste your time going here.",Kobe Asian Restaurant,6153608313,1 review,2014-07-18,"Nashville, TN",/biz/kobe-asian-restaurant-nashville,1.0,47,"Nashville, TN",Sara S.

"1609 Murfreesboro PikeNashville, TN 37217",3.5,"I've been looking around for some good Pad See Ew ever since I moved to Nashville from California. I convinced my husband to give Kobe a shot since it was in our neighborhood and we've had pretty good luck with hole-in-the-wall places in our area. Walking in, I made the decision right then and there that our food would be to go. The restaurant was strangely dim and the floors and counter tops were grimy looking. The only table occupied in the good-sized dining room were an older group of people who stared at us silently the entire time we were in the building. Talk about uncomfortable. The man at the counter was very nice and took our order immediately, however he and his wife squabbled the rest of the time we were waiting for our food. They had a small daughter around the age of three who ran back and forth from the dining room to the kitchen, and at one point she yelled out something about ants. I tried really hard not to be skeeved out, took my food and ran.The portions were generous without being too large and came with rice and soup, and the Pad See Ew, while not the best I've had, was actually pretty decent. The noodles were thick, and the vegetables had a really good fresh flavor.

"1609 Murfreesboro PikeNashville, TN 37217",3.5,"A fun sort of div-y Japanese joint. I've never been to one. We arrived at 6pm on a Thursday night and the place had only one other table occupied. We ordered chicken katsu bento boxes that came with delicious, generous tempura, California rolls, rice, miso soup, a weird ""dessert"" that we didn't like, and slightly overdone chicken katsu. I had a pot of jasmine tea for cheap and my husband drank the Thai tea--both up to par for a nice price. If the service had been better (instead of virtually nonexistent) and the ambience less creepy, I'd give it a four. Well maybe that's not true, as we've had far better bento boxes. Perhaps this place has such a stellar reputation because of the Thai aspect that we didn't taste? Or perhaps it's really good Japanese for Tennessee. But I'm giving it three stars compared to a my overall Japanese experiences in life. Oh and the bento boxes are close to $15, which takes the price to two $$, not one.

"1911 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"My wife Brandi and I had a GREAT lunch today at Lucy's Country Cafe for the first time. Owners Bobby Pinson and his wife Lucy showed true southern hospitality by checking on the tables to get input from their customers. They also obviously have a passion for good country cookin'. I would officially put the quality right up there with the areas most popular meat&3's or country buffets. You can taste the love in the food. The staff was first class and you felt comfortable from the minute you walked in. Brandi had a meat&2 for $7.99. Chicken Casserole, Turnip Greens and Mac & Cheese. I had the buffet because I wanted to try all 3 of their entrees. Fried fish, Shepherd's pie & Chicken casserole. For my veggies I had turnip greens and corn. Listen people, this food tastes just like your mom or grandma would make when you come in for a visit. It's a feast of country home cooking. One of the biggest issues with ""home cooking"" places is that they often over-season their veggies. That's not the case here. Everything was very tasty and was not over-seasoned. The food was hot and fresh. My favorite of the entrees was the chicken casserole. 100% YUM. The others were terrific as well. My wife LOVED her plate. We also had corn bread (one of the best i've ever had) and rolls (like mommas) which were brought out in a basket and handed out by the server. She was precious. They serve their drinks in a red solo cup which oddly enough made me want to find a sharpie to put my name on it. There is also a cold bar with salad, slaw, pasta salad, potato salad, fruit etc. Lucy's is also a great bang for the buck. Meat&1 is $6.99. Meat&2 is $7.99. Meat&3 is $8.99. All you can eat is $12.99. You can also just get veggies and the cold bar for $7.99. What's for desert? The BANANA PUDDING caught me off guard. It is not the ""normal"" banana pudding with wafers and chunks of bananas. It's just pudding....and I was skeptical at first, but now I want a gallon of it. I also had Bobby's Dump Cake. A buttery cake topping over cherries, pineapples and other cobbler goodness. WOW. Rich and YUM. Do yourself a favor and go to Lucy's Country Cafe. Open 11-3 Mon-Friday. Bobby Pinson is a smash hit songwriter (toby keith, sugarland, rascal flatts) and a recording artist in Nashville which is why, i'm sure, he was inspired to do a ""Sing for your Supper"" on Wednesdays from 7-11 with Live Music by friends of Bobby and a dinner special for the guests (no buffet). It will be a weekly visit for me. 5 stars because of the overall experience, atmosphere, quality of food, service and value.",Lucy’s Country Cafe,6154101311,6 reviews,2012-02-10,"Nashville, TN",/biz/lucys-country-cafe-nashville,5.0,8,"Nashville, TN",Joseph R.
"1911 BroadwayNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"With all the wonderful meat & three options in Nashville, I have no idea why anyone would come and eat here. Sure the location is convenient and there aren't any similar options nearby, but if you're craving some Southern staples for a weekday lunch, either drive over to Arnold's or to Monell's if you want to do all you can eat. Rather than spending $13 on the buffet here, I would recommend you just set that money on fire, because that would honestly be a better use for it rather than wasting it on the food here. My husband and I decided to try this place using a Groupon, and while I'm happy we only paid for one of our meals, I still left feeling really disappointed.My dissatisfaction comes down to one thing: the food here isn't any good. It's starchy, stodgy, and generally very bland. Yes, I'll grant you that the potato salad was awesome, as were the mashed potatoes, but they were anomalies since they were essentially the only items that had any flavor. The three mains (country fried steak, chicken & dumplings, copperhead pasta) were gloopy messes that literally had no seasoning whatsoever. And it wasn't just me or my palate, since I observed another diner take a big bite of the dumplings and immediately screw his face up in displeasure. He then proceeded to dump a ton of salt & pepper on his plate, as that was probably the only way to make the stuff remotely palatable. The country fried steak came with a sawmill gravy that had the consistency, and the same flavor profile (or so I would imagine), of wallpaper glue. The other sides we tried were fine (fried okra was decent), but nothing special, and apart from the potato dishes there just was nothing very tasty or exciting... except for the coleslaw which had the mystical property of somehow REMOVING FLAVOR from your mouth!!! The much-lauded ""dump cake"" was piping hot, but also was so sweet. Bottom line is the food here is great if you need to limit your sodium intake, but bad if you want to avoid diabetes.Overall, this was just an incredibly bland and depressing dining experience... and I'll admit the atmosphere doesn't help either. It's very obvious you're eating in a bar, and honestly there's a reason why we visit bars at night... they look bleak and hollow during the harsh light of day. All that stale cigarette smoke won't help whet your appetite either. I will say that the people working at Lucy's were really friendly and cheerful, but no amount of smiling would counteract the gloomy vibe pervading this place (though it will bump you up to a 2-star review). The owners clearly have a lot of heart, but whoever is in the kitchen really shouldn't be.

"96 White Bridge RdNashville, TN 37205",3.0,"I'm not sure I've given such a bad review. Chipotle is one of my favorite fast food chains. Healthy, fresh, we go all the time. However we always go to the Green Hills location, and they are a well-oiled machine. Fast, fresh, the long line moves quick.White Bridge Rd. is a different story.Clearly they just opened up. The build out is awful. There are mostly high top tables with the exception of maybe 2 or 3 regular height tables. First of all, some planner didn't think to realize a LOT of families go to chipotle and you can not put high chairs, boosters or small children at a high top table. Secondly, we went on a Friday night around 6. It was not busy yet, but several employees were congregating by the register on their cell phones. None of them cared to get back to work when customers walked in. The guy at the beginning of the line was a little slow, probably new, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. Again, employees (girls) still looking at their phones while we move thru the line. When we get to the cash register, she finally puts her phone in her pocket. We sit down. My bowl has raw f'ing chicken. The same chicken my kids just ate in their quesadilla. I took a picture I will share . At first I thought it was just chewy. It was mixed with the overcooked last batch and the ""fresh"" raw chicken in this batch. I thought I was going to vomit. Normally I would go to the manager and say something, but there didn't look to be an employee over the age of 20, it seemed pointless. What were they going to do? This manager needs to lay down the law and perhaps have a MOD on a Friday night. By the time we left it had developed a big line, I felt anxiety for them because the guy doing the beans and rice was slow as can be. Oh and did I mention there were two employees eating food at a table? If they are on break or whatever, sitting at a table eating and chit chatting looks awful when the line starts getting long. Completely unprofessional. You would never see this at the Green Hills location.Will NOT be back to this location. Just awful.

"2256 Murfreesboro PikeNashville, TN 37217",3.5,"Came here on a whim. I pass by it everyday and it never looked all that appealing to me. Was going to go to Little Ceasars for a $5 Hot N Ready, but once i pulled into the Kroger lot I decided my body was already too neglected to shove yet another pizza in it for dinner. Once I walked in I was immediately greeted and seated. There were no more than 4 tables seated in the restaurant when I came in. After 7 minutes chips and salsa was brought to the table. After another 5 my waitress was kind enough to stop by and say hi and ask what I wanted to drink. She wasn't nice. Since I had nearly fifteen minutes to look over the menu before she showed up, I knew what I wanted to eat. Simple order: house margarita on rocks -with no salt and a chicken chimichanga with double rice (no beans). She was a little put off that I didnt want beans. I assured her I was in fact sure about the no beans situation and then she was off to the kitchen. Margarita came out after a few minutes by the bartender. Very strong. Good tequila. I finished the margarita before my food got to the table. I was sipping slowly and watching tv. Not sure how long it took. I would have to guess at least 15 minutes. At least. The kitchen staff brought my food out. I ordered a chicken chimichanga but got a beef chimichanga. I'm not Hindu so it didn't really bother me. I was tired of waiting and ready to eat. My waitress did not come back to the table until I was almost done with my food. I never got asked for a refill on my drink. Didn't see her until the incorrect food order was nearly fully digested. Moral of the story. I will go back for the margaritas. The service was terrible and she was tipped my minimum of 15%.",La Terraza Mexican Restaurant,6153659979,7 reviews,2015-08-23,"Dallas, TX",/biz/la-terraza-mexican-restaurant-nashville,2.0,37,"Nashville, TN",Aaron A.
"2256 Murfreesboro PikeNashville, TN 37217",3.5,"La Terraza is just down the street from our new house, so we had to try it out. As a native Texan, I'm rather particular when it comes to good Mexican food. Nashville is pretty far north of the border, but I tried to go in with an open mind. After all, they had a great patio which looked perfect for drinking adult beverages.The interior looked pretty welcoming, but the employees sadly were not. There was no ""seat yourself"" sign and no hostess stand, so we weren't sure what to do. No one greeted us upon entry, so we had to track down a waiter and ask to be seated. One person seated us and gave us menus. Another person brought us chips and salsa. A third person asked for our drink order, which would have been an easier task had we been provided with a drink menu (we had to ask for that, too). While waiting 10-15 minutes for our waiter to come back and take our order, we saw several subsequent customers seat themselves, yet others were seated by various waiters/waitresses. Who knows. Our waiter apologized for the delay in taking our order, but still. Throughout the rest of the meal, we had other employees check on us more often than our waiter did.We started with some of their cheese dip (I was a little surprised that they didn't call it ""queso"", but whatever). The white cheese dip had great flavor, but was kind of runny. I liked the spiciness though. Too bad nobody ever came back to refill our chip basket, so we couldn't eat all of it.For my entree, I had the ""Parrillada Mar y Tierra,"" which is basically a surf and turf mixed grill. It consisted of steak, chicken breast, shrimp, fish fillet, and chorizo, served with a cheese quesadilla, rice, beans, tomatoes, and avocado slices. I kind of wanted the shrimp fajita nachos, but that seemed kind of redundant considering the aforementioned chips and dip.The quesadilla was tasty and cheesy, but uber greasy. The refried beans were really runny and had no flavor. As for the avocado slices, maybe I'm just lazy, but I was expecting them to be unpeeled. No, they just sliced a whole avocado and served it peel and all (no pit at least). Maybe they should have removed the produce sticker from the peel, which is yet another reason to peel the dang thing before you serve it.My steak had a nice sear, but was tough and chewy. A few bites were also REALLY salty. The chicken was razor thin, thinner than the fish fillet. It had a nice flavor, but was very dry. The shrimp had a nice sear and were cooked well. They were probably my favorite part of the dish. The fish was cooked well too. It was tender and flaky and tasty. The chorizo was incredibly greasy and had a weird mushy texture. I'm not sure why they removed it from the casings before serving it.If I come back here, it'll be for margaritas, but it sure won't be for food.",La Terraza Mexican Restaurant,6153659979,541 reviews,2014-07-15,"Nashville, TN",/biz/la-terraza-mexican-restaurant-nashville,2.0,37,"Nashville, TN",Jared K.

"2256 Murfreesboro PikeNashville, TN 37217",3.5,"I go here every now and then to get a switch up to one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Antioch, Camino Real! I actually just had lunch here today and I had a very enjoyable experience! It just felt very new here some reason! I'm not sure why, maybe new management but I saw some different faces that I've never seen before! We had one very pleasant, and attractive young man waiting our table. He gave us ample time to order from the lunch menu they have instead of the usual big book of different things to order and eat and I was ok with that. Prices are decent for a Mexican restaurant, I ordered the Burrito La Terraza while the little sis ordered her fave as usual, enchiladas supremas.The chips and dips were different this time, having a nice spice level that I enjoyed and thickness.

This isn't the cleanest of places but that is to be expected. The kitchen is half exposed so that's comforting. Their salsa is better than most in Nashville; its very tomato-y, not too spicy, but not ketchup-y either. The queso is white cheese and very thin, nothing added. Tasty though.

"400 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"This review is just for their catering. I ordered the ""Two Meat Spread"" and it was awesome! Everything was ready when we arrived at the agreed upon time and they helped carry it to my car. I ordered enough for 30 people but it fed more than that. The meats definitely went faster than the beans, rice, and other items; however, there was still some meat left over. It really made feeding a lot of people easy. The set up was fast and kept everything at the right temp.  I would highly recommend using Chipotle to cater your party. Loved it! We ate left overs for several days!! And I still have so much shredded cheese left over! I loved that they gave us plenty of guac.

"400 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.5,Poor service today at Chipotle.  Going to Chipotle is like going to Disneyland for adults.  The staff at chipotle today was either all hung over or all just pissed off.  They just slopped the ingredients and gave so little.  When I asked for some more rice she gave 1/4 more if a spoonful.  They were low on ingredients so instead of filling my bowl to the correct portion and getting more they just gave a tiny amount.  I left very annoyed after this experience.  I suggest the West End location.,Chipotle Mexican Grill,,55 reviews,2014-11-01,"Nashville, TN",/biz/chipotle-mexican-grill-nashville-4,2.0,29,"Nashville, TN",Alisha W.

They were out of chicken and frantically cooking and slicing chicken to keep up with the orders coming in. The person cutting the chicken signaled to another employee that it was ready and she went to the cutting board to get a spoon-full. She made a comment to the person cooking and cutting the chicken for a moment and then she brought it to the line and asked what else I'd like on my burrito. I mentioned to her that the chicken looked a little pink. She took it back to the cook and showed it to him and threw it out, came back and apologized to me. They made me another burrito and gave it to me for free. I'm appalled that it took 3 people to discover that a piece of chicken was dangerously undercooked.

But its what happens when you move away from the source. If there are some veg friendly places I am overlooking, please drop some knowledge on this transplant.This is your standard Chipotle. If you like Chipotle in general, you will like this one. I work across the street and this is the best vegan option for my long days on campus. I tend to burrito here frequently (burrito is a verb here). If you don't like Chipotle, you won't like this one either.I find that Chipotle is a fix, but is not quite fully satisfying.

"400 21st Ave SNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"Seriously with Kristin G. on this one, overpriced Americanized Mexicanish food? The menu is basic fresh ingredients, the resulting burrito (or bowl) is fairly tastey, but for one person: a veggie burrito and a drink I left with a $9 bill - a bit much considering the veggies and rice were under-seasoned and I could have scored the same burrito with a bit more flair for less, elsewhere. I have to disclose I have not had the meat options and those may be killer. I think that the trendy vibe is fun for people, and again the food is good for the most part, this location is packed with College students and Vandy employees as it is on 21st across from the medical center/college so location isn't hurting them if you are walking. Parking is a b*tch! small lot and arrive early as in 11am! Service is fast and typically friendly but the way the glass ""burrito station"" is set up and add in the background of a packed restaurant, it can be hard to hear when ordering the ingredients for your burrito. I repeated myself about 3 times as did the guy building my burrito, to the point we were both a bit irritated by the time it was done.

I got the Chicken n' Dumplings, steamed broccoli and cheese, cornbread and a piece of pie (forget what kind, sorry). The Dumplings were a little salty but not too overbearing.. Should have added some pepper to em to even it out but i never thought about it. The broccoli was very good, soft but not too soft which in my opinion is a bit hard to do. Oh and the pie? Now that i think about it more it was a Chocolate Pecan pie. I was really impressed by the taste of it. Was rather good. Only reason why this place doesn't get 5 stars? They seem to be rather short handed so the wait time in the line for food was a bit long.

I ordered a quart of hot and sour soup along with our main dishes, and I didn't realize until I got home that they had given me a pint instead of a quart.  I called the restaurant to complain, and they offered to drive over a quart of hot and sour soup - which they promptly did (the guy arrived literally 5 minutes later).  It's a family-run business, which I like to support.  Try it out - you won't regret it!",No. 1 Chinese,6158339999,71 reviews,2015-05-15,"Nashville, TN",/biz/no-1-chinese-nashville-2,5.0,27,"Nashville, TN",Briana P.

"6900 Lenox Village DrNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"As some folks said, fairly average Chinese takeout place, but with that said, a good average. My hubby and I used to be exclusive with Evergreen Express, but within the last year or so something changed over there and the food hasn't been as good. So we finally gave this place a chance ( plus it's much closer to us). I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Our favorite dish to order is orange chicken, and I live egg rolls. No. 1 Chinese doors both well. The chicken comes out hour and cripsy with a decent orange sauce. We love spicy, so I always order it ""extra spicy"", but we've yet to actually get a spicy orange chicken. So not the place to get your spicy fix. The rice is usually well steamed as well. It comes out hot and fluffy, so I'm usually pleased with it. Egg rolls are good - nothing to write home about, but I doubt you'd be disappointed either. Overall, I'd recommend the place.

"6704 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.0,"I stopped in here on my way to Costco, my wife usually loves this franchise, and I wasn't sure if I had eaten here, or the other, similar franchise. The server was the highlight of this experience, as she was pleasant, witty, and helpful with the order. I told her I was dining in, was given a number, and advised that the meal would be brought to my table.This is where things started falling apart. I walked over to the first table, and noticed it was very dirty, looked around and noticed most of the tables in my sight were dirty. I found one of the relatively clean tables, and placed the number holder on the table. Now, Im going to pause here to advise that the next part here will be gross, and somewhat graphic, but it was my experience. I also will admit that I am a somewhat fastidious person, and had previously worked in the food service industry, so I know of the warning signs of a below average restaurant.As I walked towards the bathroom, I noticed that the trash cans were overflowing, and noticed several more dirty tables. This had me rightfully concerned and I was somewhat apprehensive of the condition I would find the bathroom in....Again, this will be gross, and you might want to stop reading here.... If not, just know you were forewarned:The bathroom has one urinal, a handicapped stall, and one sink, near the urinal. Some crazy customer, or perhaps a disgruntled employee had deficated into and onto the lip of the urinal! After the initial shock of sering this, I quickly went to the handicapped stall, which while not covered in feces, was still covered in urine. I quickly decided I could hold it, but as is my custom before eating I went to wash my hands. I tried to avert my gaze as much as possible, but could feel it staring me down from the urinal... Once my hands were washed, I of course saw that the paper towel dispenser was empty... This left me no choice, but to pass the urinal again, to get to the stall and grab enough toilet paper to cover my hands enough to allow me to open the door. Which I had to assume was as filthy as the rest of the bathroom.Once clear of this little house of horror I looked toward my table to see my food had not arrived. I normally would have cancelled my order and left; but I was extremely hungry, in a hurry to finish some errands before getting back home, and trying to give a newly opened restaurant the benefit of doubt. I decided to give the nice girl at the counter a heads up on the bathroom situation when I noticed my meal cooling off to the side of the counter. As I grabbed for the tray, another, extremely disinterested employee, and probably the one that was supposed to bring me the tray, asked if I needed any silverware... I of course said yes, and tried to discreetly mention the bathroom as there was a line of new customers with in easy earshot, and I wasn't trying to put the place on blast. The rep, quickly interrupted me,  stating ""We'll get to it.""The food was okay, it probably would have been better before it cooled off; however I could barely notice it as a couple more male patrons had walked out of the bathroom and were discussing the fecal disaster piece...In this time I had also noticed the plate my food was on was dirty as well, and that was when I got up and walked away. One star, only for the one good employee at the beginning of this horrible experience. My wife asked me why I didn't get a manager, and I responded that I just couldn't deal with telling a manager how to do their job correctly after going through so many examples of bad management. I was a Quality Assurance Engineer for years, and it was clear to me that this was more than just one bad or lazy employee, it was a poor system of managing employees.

"6704 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.0,"I have been seeing the ads for this place on social media and was so looking forward to healthy Caribbean food on the fly.  It is on my way home from work so I was prepared to have it be a dinner favorite.  Sadly, I did not like it.  The food was disappointingly flavorless and not served hot. The atmosphere was also odd with loud pushy customers, seemingly untrained staff, previously mentioned cleanliness issues, and no good system to manage customer flow. Napkins are needed on tables. I will say the mango punch drink was delicious.

"6704 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",3.0,"I rated Pollo Tropical in Smynar  with Five stars. I took my clients to the Smynar location for lunch meeting  from time to time.  I was so excited when found out another Pollo Tropical was under construction in Nashville, TN and near my house.   I bragged to the wife and kids that as soon they open , I wil take them there for diner. We had diner at this location two weeks ago and Oh Boy, I was wrong and embarrassed for taken the family there. We ordered three plates; roast chicken and wings.  I should said some thing immiditately when they brought  it to the table. The roast chicken's skin was dried out  the chicken looked deflated. The wings also looked dried and burnt.  I tasted both and they were dried (chicken jerky like). The wings were over cooked with burnt bitter taste.  The restaurant  just opened and there was hardly any customers there. I think instead of get rid of old food from earlier hours. They re-grilled the wings and let the roast chicken sat too long. Yes, they saved $$ from doing that  but they loose a regular customer  and free marketing from me.I hope the Manager or Onwer of this location read this review.",Pollo Tropical,8667697696,11 reviews,2015-09-11,"Nashville, TN",/biz/pollo-tropical-nashville-4,1.0,15,"Nashville, TN",miata a.

"1516 Demonbreun StNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"A solid fast food style Indian restaurant in Nashville. I ordered the goat biryani, chicken tikka, and tandoori chicken. The goat biryani portions were huge. The rice had a surprisingly authentic Hyderabadi taste - each bite was overwhelmingly flavorful, exactly what you would expect from a proper biryani. The chicken tikka masala was a pinch sweeter than spicy but still fingerlicking good. The tandoori chicken came with two chicken quarters and was enough to feed at least two people. Very flavorful, but not as strongly marinated as I would have liked. The server was very welcoming and polite. Parking here sucks but exactly what you would expect on Demonbreun. The spicyness level was also very mild - perfect if you can't stand gulping water down after every bite, but I'd strongly recommend asking to make each dish a bit more spicy. The extra kick would really have upped the taste.This is as close to an authentic Hyderabadi biryani place I will probably find in the south.

The first 2 times I've been at the Bongo Java, I had a great time with awesome Chai Tea Lattes & pretty good food. This 3rd time however, completely changed my mind.

The cashier guy didn't even give the obligatory ""Hi! How can I help you?"" He just stood there looking at as. We ordered and went to our table.Second: Food arrived and the Hummus Plate I always order showed up, but the hummus looked different and tasted different too - VERY SPICY! Which all this is fine, but I'm not a fan of spicy food, so when my fiancé went to take it back in exchange for something else, the staff acted so annoyed with him. We ordered a sandwich instead. Third: Sandwich arrived looking delicious, but it came with a side of chips & salsa - not the side salad we ordered. When we mentioned to the waitress we had asked for the salad with the sandwich she just looked at us and said, ""Oh, yeah I thought you said chips & salsa."" And she walked away. That was it. As though, ya get what ya get. I was pissed. I went BACK up to the registrar to get the chips & salsa replaced, which as you can imagine was a big ordeal I even asked such a thing! They brought it back with a huge mound of salad as though to say, ""There!

"2007 Belmont BlvdNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"I've frequented Bongo many times because of the convenience. I've always felt the food was just ok and the staff seem uninterested in being there. But after visiting today, I decided it would be the LAST time I would give them my business. If I could give zero stars based on service alone I would. After waiting nearly 30 minutes for an egg on an English muffin (not too complicated), I asked the extremely unwelcoming guy at the counter who took my order, how long the wait would be, especially since customers that ordered after me seemed to get their orders. He then looked at me as if I were bothering him and replied by saying ""I don't even know what you're asking me"", and walks away. At this point I'm extremely annoyed. Then he returns from the kitchen with the same order I placed and gives it to another customer, whom again, ordered after me. I then proceed to the counter to get my money back and he questions me about the order that he took. By this time I can't even wrap my mind around waiting another 30 minutes for a simple sandwich and more importantly, giving this business who doesn't seem to care about their customers, my money. I asked for my money back and was never given an apology or anything. This place is a huge disappointment.

"2007 Belmont BlvdNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"I cant stop thinking about the Big Bad Hash Brown. I had it two weeks ago and I probably dream about it every night and wake up in the morning asking myself, 'is this the day I can treat myself to another big bad hash brown?'. Hash browns are the best when they are crunchy and these bad boys have got the crunch going on perfectly. I would be satisfied here BUT Bongo Java goes to a whole new level when they add onion, tomato and a ton of melted cheddar cheese. Seriously so good. The hash brown is a big enough portion to be considered a meal, and bonus points - its only $3.50. Now that i've hit rock bottom and written PARAGRAPHS about hash browns I can move on. Bongo Java had a really good selection of tea and the barista (i think thats a Starbucks term? woops!) recommended this great lavender green tea that I would happily order again. I might try some more of their selection but I'm thinking the lavender green could be my go-to.  Really cool big patio where I can picture myself doing some school work in the future.

After waiting more than 10 minutes for my latte (after waiting in line to order), and seeing many people who'd ordered after me getting their drinks and going, I caught the barista's eye and asked about the drink. He hadn't gotten the order at all. He was very apologetic and said something to the cashier, who just stared at him blankly.To be honest, I don't even remember the last time I went.

"2007 Belmont BlvdNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"I used to be a barista and I have worked in food service for several years. I have been a happy patron of Bongo Java since I was 15. I used to love it. For at least ten years I was a fanatical Bongo supporter. I even had a tee-shirt until I spilled paint on it about three years ago. After today, (I paid and tipped so that I could get my food order and coffee order incorrectly prepared and to be fussed at by the barista, but it is not just today. My coffee hasn't been prepared properly at Bongo in years. I was never an award-winning expert at espresso when I used to make it, but I know from experience it doesn't take a genius to make a good head of foam, just someone who cares. It ticks me off when I am handed my drink and I feel like I could go back there and fix it better myself. They axed my favorite meal, the plain quesadilla. The service is often less than friendly. ) I am NOT going back. Hot and Cold and Fido have not done me this wrong yet, so I'll still go there. But Bongo is out of my life and I'd rather go to Cafe Coco than any of them (though, Hot and Cold has the best ice cream in town, no bones about it. And they make a great iced americano with rosewater mint syrup!) at this point, anyway.

"2007 Belmont BlvdNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"There was a time (a *dark* time, mind you, one that makes you grit your teeth and get that steely look in your eyes when people ask about it) when I spent more time on the porch at Bongo Java than in my living room. That was, like, three years ago, though, so the useful bits of this review have to be sorted out of the larger legacy of secrets and shame.Let's get the boring stuff out of the way first: Bongo Java is a perfectly competent coffeehouse. They serve a very nice sweet iced tea (get the fruit tea if they have it), an excellent ""basic breakfast"" for a reasonable price, and some kind of insane coffee that I suspect is spiked with PCP or goofballs or Guatemalan Insanity Peppers or something because whenever I drink it I feel like I need to get into a shouting match with a hobo or wrestle a raccoon for ham scraps or something (no, I'm not a coffee wimp, you jerk, I drink the stuff as if the cold hand of Death itself was tugging at my laptop bag--but I swear there's some sort of bad juju in that coffee). They have wifi and places to sit and terrible music and snotty baristas, so yeah, it's a coffeehouse. Don't go on Saturday or Sunday mornings unless you're fond of waiting in line forever.What sets BJ (lord that's an unfortunate acronym) from other coffeehouses is the massive and well-populated porch, for which I forgive them most of their offenses. As others have noted, the patrons are mostly college-aged hipsters, as you might expect, but there's actually much more variance than that. There's a significant population of chess players who show up every so often to chain-smoke and punch the clock, providing a hypnotic ballet of strategy and vicarious nicotine intake. There are Vanderbilt grad students staring at their laptops in a concerted psychic effort to make their dissertations write themselves. There are off-duty baristas slouching about. And there's always one or two old guys hovering over the whole business. Given the general youth of the clientele, it's a bit strange to see them there all the time.Which leads me to my final point: Bongo Java, despite seeming to be an innocuous, inoffensive coffeehouse, is actually more similar to some kind of monstrous, kelp-besmirched sea creature that, krakenlike, winds its horrible tentacles around you and drags you down into its inky lair. Bongo Java doesn't want your money; it wants your SOUL. It wants you to remain on the porch forever, swilling coffee and talking about obscure movies. The signs are all there:Exhibit A) The business primarily serves an addictive substance (coffee)Exhibit B) This substance is commonly consumed with an additional addictive substance (nicotine)Exhibit C) The coffeeshop is a self-contained unit: since it serves food and drink, and since I suspect that the second floor of the converted house that contains it is still... a house, you could theoretically remain there indefinitelyExhibit D) You can find the same cast of characters there on any day of the week, at any time of the day or nightExhibit E) I strongly suspect that the old folks who can be found at all times on the porch are people who were lured in by Bongo Java and NEVER LEFTSo anyway, yeah. You should probably still go here, because the porch is nice and sunny and sometimes the cats from the neighboring houses come and visit. But don't fall for it if someone offers you some low-protein gruel and a place to crash while you're there.",Bongo Java,6153855282,31 reviews,2013-06-14,"Gulfport, Tampa Bay, FL",/biz/bongo-java-nashville-2,3.0,125,"Nashville, TN",Leslie G.

I do love coming there in the mornings however to just have a small coffee, sit on the patio, & just relax. There is plenty of seating, inside & out.

"2007 Belmont BlvdNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"I've experienced the full spectrum of emotion (and service) at dear Bongo, and have come away feeling pretty 50/50 about the place. But despite my own personal feelings, here are a few highlights. FOOD: Always fresh, never ONCE had a problem. All of their bagel bombs and sandwiches are nom-worthy and their daily soup specials are 90% of the time outstanding. You do sometimes get that eyebrow-raising one passing through. If you're not sure if you'll be a fan of the soup, they give you a free sample. My recommendations would be the Bongo Basic for breakfast (the hash browns are just....so....good), the turkey pesto wrap, the gobbler, the new chicken salad sandwich (with fresh dill!) or a bomb. Be careful with the toasted bread...I always manage to scrape up the roof of my mouth when I eat the toasted sandwiches. Is that just me? Do I have a defect? Oh, and they carry Las Paletas Gourmet Popsicles. Need I say more?COFFEE: I've never been a fan of coffee black. If I'm given the option of a latte, I'll take it. With that said, their Irish cream latte is my absolute favorite coffee drink. Not just here - anywhere. That's high praise, Bongo. Fido in Hillsboro Villiage just got rid of their Irish cream syrup, so Bongo is getting a lot more of my business now. This latte iced is - dare I say it - almost more delicious than its hotter version. SERVICE: I like what another reviewer wrote about the service here: maybe some people like being treated like crap. And that pretty much sums it up. Maybe it's because they get a tick-inducing mix of music industry execs and college students. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. But - befriend one barista and you gain the world. AMBIANCE: The music is pretty loud, and the selection is a serious hit-or-miss. When Passion Pit or the Beatles come on, I give a nod of approval. As much as I love Mew, I'd rather not sit through their album while trying to pound out a paper that's due the next morning. There are a lot of nooks and crannies in the back and one table upstairs that give plenty of privacy if desired.CROWD: This place is an exhibit of hipsters in their natural habitat. Usually they won't bother you if you don't bother them, but you'll stick out like the yuppie you try so hard to not be when you pull your PC out of your bright purple L.L. Bean backpack. I switched to a Mac and started carrying a dirty over sized messenger bag just to stop the staring. All right, I exaggerate, but only a little. The front porch has turned into a general smoking section now that Belmont banned smoking campus-wide. If you'd like to enjoy your coffee smoke free, I recommend sitting indoors. The crowd volume can be seriously overwhelming during peak *cough - school - cough* hours and seasons, so try visiting during the summer or school breaks; the crowd dwindles to an almost normal volume.If you prefer a certain noise or service level, maybe wait until your preferences change to try the food and coffee. But if you're a foodie and could care less about much else, then Bongo is your new best friend.",Bongo Java,6153855282,2 reviews,2012-12-19,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bongo-java-nashville-2,4.0,125,"Nashville, TN",Shannon J.

"2007 Belmont BlvdNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"When I first started going to Bongo Java (14 years now?), it was the sort of place where people struck up conversations with random strangers, played chess on the front porch, drugs were dealt in the back room by employees and the coffee slingers were occasionally baked.  They had signs up everywhere about no outside food or beverage and had to shoo away the broke coffee-beggers.  The bathroom was a place to be feared, and the Nun Bun reigned supreme.I left for a while.  I moved back and the place, as far as I can tell, is a bunch of people on laptops sipping on lattes eating food that really has not changed much, other than price, from the beginning.  I saw reviews down a bit saying this is the place for counter-culture, but I start to wonder what counter culture war is being waged there... the counter talk-to-strangers war?  The counter be in a public space and act as though you're connected to that space and time war?  At least when I've seen it lately it's just a Starbucks with a slightly lower class of SUV driver and last year's Macbook pro.This may sound like I'm complaining, but I'm not.  Times change and places change.  Bongo has become gentrified, and that saddens me a bit.  The coffee still tastes burned to me every other time I go, but it's decent.  The special drinks, ok... the food, it is ok, pricey for just ok though.The line still queues out the door due to poor planning on placement of the counter.  New people there only need to know you wait for your drink near the counter and take your flag for any food.I miss my old Bongo Java, but times they change and so do your old haunts.  The place is now perfect if you want to go, open up a laptop and be antisocial in public while drinking pretty good coffee and eating ok food at a place that used to scare decent folk out.  If you're looking to find a place to drop off your 16 year old multi-tattooed kid, this isn't it anymore.Um, so yeah, I recommend this place if that were not evident through my nostalgia and dislike of the laptop people.",Bongo Java,6153855282,573 reviews,2010-09-29,"Nashville, TN",/biz/bongo-java-nashville-2,3.0,125,"Nashville, TN",Paul K.

But its kind of a nice feeling, its its own little community.Now the atmosphere is awesome. They hang local artwork, and have a great outdoor porch, with huge trees as shade. The coffee and food is all great. Im a fan of the Pesto Bagel Bomb, Fancy grilled cheese or the breakfast bagel.  I've tried many things on the menu, and never have I been disappointed.

Every now and then, I'd come here to study, and though it can be quite loud, I was able to get a lot done. The food is like Fido since it's owned by the same group. The only brew I like to get if it's available is the Mystic Brew (Dark Roast). They do have a quite a list of coffee drinks, which are not too bad. I've had the granola, which was sooo tasty. Granola + Strawberries & Bananas + Soy Milk = So filling and yummy. I've also had their vegetarian burrito. It was filled with beans, peppers, onions?, and salsa. It was big and filling and tasty. Costs about ~$7. The staff is so friendly. They have an upstairs too and do have shows there occasionally. The patio is fun to sit at when the weather is nice. Usually when I'm outside, I end up talking to random people. Smoking is only allowed outside. If you're looking for parking, either park on the road or in the back.Like I said, it can be pretty loud with everyone's conversation.

I used to frequent this place because it was so convenient when I went to Belmont. Now I come because I love it so much, and it brings back great memories. The coffee is great, I personally prefer a hot or iced Chai (depending on the time of year), but the ""P-Diddy"" peppermint mocha is pretty damn good too. I also love the apple pie, which is basically hot cider with whipped cream, which is perfect during the fall weather. While most people come just for the coffee, their food is worth trying. The breakfast sandwiches are awesome, along with everything else I've ever tried there. I love hanging out at Bongo on a beautiful sunny morning, sitting on the patio, sipping a drink, people watching. Its definitely one of my favorite places to simply chill in Nashville.

The staff is friendly, but I usually only order from there if I'm craving one of their pluses or feeling particularly lazy.

"Nashville, TN 37203",5.0,"There are many burgers in Nashville.  There are your standard thick backyard BBQ style meat monsters and your thin, shake shack style burgers. In my opinion,  the best kind of burger is made of ground meat that hasn't been smashed into the griddle. This way, the burger has an much larger surface area to crisp and brown and the cheese melts into the the cracks. Electric Sliders has perfected this style of burger (ahem, slider.)

"Nashville, TN 37203",5.0,"We found the Electric Sliders truck at the Adventure Science Center's July 4th ""Red, White & Blue"" fireworks-viewing party. Score!Sliders can be a little boring, but the folks at Electric Sliders have put some serious innovation into their menu. With ingredients like apple-almond-fig jam, sriracha mayo, and lemon-herb cheddar cream cheese, these mini-burgers are anything but boring. Everything on the menu sounded great, but I ended up ordering a Two-Slider Combo with the Piggy Stardust and the Disco Demi.Their Piggy Stardust slider is stacked high with pulled pork, pimento cheese, fried pickled onions, and a bourbon-balsamic barbecue sauce on a brioche bun. Although the pulled pork wasn't as smoky as it could have been, it was certainly smokier than I expected it to be. It was also seasoned well, but I would have liked some bark in the mix. The fried onions added a great crunchy texture, while the pimento cheese gave it a nice creaminess. The barbecue sauce was more like a bourbon-balsamic vinaigrette, and I liked that much better.Despite its all-beef patty, the Disco Demi is a far cry from the standard cheeseburger. It's got sharp cheddar, pickled onions, arugula, white truffle vinaigrette, and a rosemary demi glace on brioche. Yum! The beef patty was delicious with an awesome sear on it, and the melty sharp cheddar was a perfect pairing. The pickled onions and arugula gave this burger a good crunch and a great flavor. The white truffle also made things super tasty, but I didn't catch any rosemary.

"4928 Edmondson PikeNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"I've reviewed one of Nashville's Korean restaurants, Korea House, but have been wanting to try the other for a while.  Seoul Garden is actually closer to where I live than Korea House, but both restaurants are very different!  Since people always ask me about local Korean restaurants, I felt I needed to experience both to offer a solid reco.I liked that Seoul Garden had the cooktop tables I'm used to seeing in Korean restaurants that serve BBQ.  There is a two-order minimum on BBQ to sit there, but we knew we wanted MEAT!  We started with some steamed mandu dumplings, and they served the requisite banchan small plates.For our BBQ, we ordered my favorite kalbi beef ribs, as well as spicy pork dwaeji gogi.  I felt like they were a bit stingy on the kalbi, but they provided an ample plate of the pork.  There was even enough for leftovers.  Both were tasty, but I'm all about Korean BBQ beef, so if I came back I might ask for double if I'm sharing.We also ordered bibimbap, the dolsot version in the stone pot.  My sister and Mom don't like the stone pot version as much, but Lauren loved how the rice got crispy where it touched the pot.  I agree that it made it even yummier!We enjoyed cooking our meat at the table, and everything tasted great.  The service wasn't that great once our meat was cooked, but there was a decent crowd for a weeknight.The best part about Korean food is that it is shared.  We ordered three entrees, but we all ate bits and pieces of everything.Overall, I'd say that I like both of Nashville's Korean restaurants.  Both are authentic, though not the same as what you'd experience in major Korean hubs like New York and L.A.There are things on the menu at Korea House that they don't have at Seoul Garden, and the price is a bit more reasonable.  But for the cooktop experience, I do enjoy Seoul Garden's setup.  They have more seating as well, and Korea House had a wait the last time we visited.  I'd say that if you want laid back dining with a lot of selection (like casual dish dokbokki), choose Korea House.  If you want BBQ cooked at your table with a hungry larger group, go Seoul Garden.  I think my mother would approve of both (and already likes Korea House) but would choose KH for the prices any day.",Seoul Garden,6154453613,155 reviews,2014-10-08,"Franklin, TN",/biz/seoul-garden-nashville-2,3.0,62,"Nashville, TN",Aubrey W.

I ask the waitress why did the new table get the egg side dish & she tried to say they were here before us ...I called her on the lie & we paid for the uneaten food & left. Never going back she was so rude from the beginning.The same waitress had did the same previously but I believed her that time since it was late but now I'm the wiser.

"4928 Edmondson PikeNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"Seoul Garden gets major props in my book for the fact that they are the only Korean restaurant in Nashville to have a tableside BBQ option - which is one of the parts of Korean food I enjoy so much and miss from the other Korean places in town.  Our experience dining there, however, left a little something to be desired.  We walked in and were seated at one of the non-BBQ tables almost immediately.  And then we sat and waited for someone to take our order.  And waited.  And waited.  We nearly got up to leave when finally a waitress rushed to our table to take our drink orders.  At this point, we were ready to order our food as well.  When we mentioned we wanted the tableside BBQ, we were told that we *should* have told them that from the beginning.  The waitress ran away to ask someone else if we could be seated at one of the BBQ tables, and 10 minutes later, came back to move us and take our orders.We ordered 3 main dishes (hey, we were hungry): the beef bulgogi, the sirloin and spicy squid with noodles.  The first 2 were BBQ dishes.  The waitress came back to the table with the typical Korean side dishes, all of which were good, none of which were stellar.  The problem wasn't with the side dishes - it was with the fact that they were thrown at us (literally tossed onto the table) so she could get to one of the other tables.  Same with the raw meat for the BBQ - there was no demonstration on how to cook it.  After we'd let the grill heat for a bit, we placed the meat onto the BBQ and the waitress quickly came back to tell us we were doing it wrong and we shouldn't have started without her.  Um, if you say so.  After rushing back to us (seriously, this woman was logging some miles that night), she turned the meat over and almost pulled it off the grill to serve to us - halfway cooked.  We politely asked her to keep it on for a bit longer, which she did.  We began pulling the meat off ourselves when we were ready to eat it.The spicy squid was pretty good, though we didn't care for the angel-hair pasta served with it.  We were expecting an udon-type noodle, so the thin, weak strands of pasta threw us for a textural loop within the dish.Would we return?  Maybe, if we were craving BBQ.  We live too far away to return just because we're craving Korean.  My husband joked that if we were going to go that far for Korean food, we might as well hop a plane and head to NYC - or Korea, for that matter!",Seoul Garden,6154453613,126 reviews,2014-07-21,"Nashville, TN",/biz/seoul-garden-nashville-2,3.0,62,"Nashville, TN",Tracy F.

Only negative was that we had to wait awhile before anyone came over to take our order...it seemed to be at least 20 minutes before we finally were able to get someone's attention to bring our drinks and put in our food order.I definitely would love to come back and try more food!",Seoul Garden,6154453613,152 reviews,2013-12-28,"Nashville, TN",/biz/seoul-garden-nashville-2,4.0,62,"Nashville, TN",Kaleena 'Kala' H.

"4928 Edmondson PikeNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"This place was amazing.  My nephew and niece are adopted from South Korea and have visited there.  My sister and the kids went there and they said the food was completely authentic.  It's awesome to be able to barbecue the different marinated meats on the grill found right in the center of the table.  The service is amazing and the food, as authentic as it is, is still very appealing to an American palette.  You will see many Koreans there, which I take as a good sign as far as the authenticity and quality of the food.The only complaint we had was that since a lot of the dishes you order or kind of community dishes as is customary with most Asian cuisine, the table was way too small to hold all the food while being able to be able to barbecue meat and still be able to eat your food too.  That was the reason for a lack of one star.Apart from that, if you like authentic Asian cuisine and trying something different, then I highly recommend this place!Also, for those comments about the staff not being friendly, my nephew and niece, who though are Korean by blood, were raised in the States, said that on their visit to Seoul last year they found out that at restaurants their, servers and hostesses are trained to simply serve food and not bother patrons at all.  They only come by when they are summoned and they are not taught to be friendly and smiley with customers as that is not something that is practiced there the way it is in the United States.",Seoul Garden,6154453613,6 reviews,2014-04-11,"Murfreesboro, TN",/biz/seoul-garden-nashville-2,4.0,62,"Nashville, TN",Raj H.

"4928 Edmondson PikeNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"I never thought that I would be eating Korean food in Nashville. I'm from Southern California where Asian restaurants are a dime a dozen and I was really skeptical about eating Korean food in the South, but the group I was with wanted to eat KBBQ so I went along with it. Upon walking in, I noted that it was pretty crowded and as expected, the service was a little slow as a result. The servers were really friendly though and looked like they genuinely wanted to make sure you have a good meal. Although my boyfriend and I are regular KBBQ eaters, his friend and girlfriend weren't so we decided order more marinated meat than non-marinated. I find that to truly enjoy KBBQ though, you should definitely stick with the non-marinated. We ordered servings of Bulgogi, Chicken, and the classic pork for the meats, and ordered the Seafood Pancake as an appetizer. The seafood pancake while tasty was really lacking in the ingredients. It was more filler than anything. I was quite happy with the side dishes though. They were tasty with my rice. The KBBQ itself was a little less satisfactory. I appreciate that they were going for authenticity with the coal grill but this means that you're going to have to cook your meat fast before the coals die out. I did not like this at all because towards the end, we simply just didn't have enough heat to cook our meat through fast enough. Because of this, we had a lot of downtime and our meal was a lot longer than expected. However, the flavor of the marinade itself wasn't too bad. I preferred the taste of the chicken over the bulgogi but in the end would really have preferred to eat non-marinated since the pork was delicious. It's hard to find decent Asian food in the South and I get that this restaurant has to work with what they have. For the location, it's worth a shot. 3/5",Seoul Garden,6154453613,822 reviews,2013-06-17,"Irvine, CA",/biz/seoul-garden-nashville-2,3.0,62,"Nashville, TN",Michelle L.

We find it to be expensive, but since they give you so much food it's worth it. I can never eat all of mine. I usually get the Jap Chae. It's sweet potato noodles with veggies in sesame oil and other things. It has a sweet taste. Very delicious (I especially recommend it with tofu).There are a lot of really great soups too. A lot of the dishes are spicy, but they have non-spicy options as well, which is good for those who are not  used it. There is a  neat option to sit at  the grilling tables, which just means you can cook your meat while you enjoy their yummy side dishes. There are only four of these tables and they seat large groups, on busy nights you might want to call ahead and make reservations. Another neat thing, which I still need to try is the private Karaoke rooms. They apparently have options in several languages. It's on my 'to try list'. Over all, we enjoy this place because they serve you a lot of veggies and my family and I really enjoy that. We are not big meat eaters, so it works perfect for us.

"4928 Edmondson PikeNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"I heart Seoul Garden.Decor and ambience are far ahead of some of the other Korean options in town (although I do think it would be nice if they upgrade the bench/banquette seating to something slightly more cushioned and less stained).Either service has massively improved since other Yelpers reviewed this place or my standards are on a different level, because I thought we got greater service and it looked like other patrons were getting good service too. There were a couple of little slips at the beginning (we received our dumplings before we had any chopsticks and then had to ask for a couple of small plates since we were sharing), but later on I thought the service was terrific with our waitress (Hailey?) frequently keeping an eye on our table from a discrete distance just to make sure we didn't need anything. A subtle hand gesture or nod of the head and she was winging our way to our table to bring us more banchan or get us a go box.All of this would be pleasant but relatively meaningless unless the food was tasty. Fortunately, Seoul Garden serves up some delicious Korean comestibles.As others have mentioned, the kimchee is great. There were two kimchee banchan and both had fantastic bite. In addition to the regular banchan, we also received complimentary bowls of a subtle soup/broth enriched with a wealth of crunchy bean sprouts. Not sure if that was standard or a daily special.We each ordered the dol sot bi bim map (rice bowl in a stone hot pot with lots of veggies and beef on top). I ordered the regular and my wife sprang for the $2 (or $3?) upgrade with higher quality gal bi beef. Both were good, but I'd suggest paying more for the gal bi as it boosted the dish to a higher level of deliciousness.The menu is extensive and we definitely plan to go back and try some of the other options including sul lang tang (ox broth soup) and maybe a squid dish recommended by the waitress.So excited to have found this place.

"4928 Edmondson PikeNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"Journeyed here for a group function during lunch.  I generally enjoy Korean food, but I have only had the food that my Korean friend and his family make.  I've never been to a Korean restaurant before.  Thus, maybe my review is skewed or not a proper baseline.That said, the service was not terribly good as has been mentioned in numerous reviews.  And, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to forgive someone for having horrible service just because ""Asian places having service that sucks"" as an over-generalization.  The service was terrible, absolutely terrible.The kimchi tasted just like my friend's mother makes it... freaking good.  The steamed and the fried dumplings (we ordered both at $6.95 each) were pretty good.  I ate from the steamed side mostly, but that's just because I tend to avoid fried foods for health purposes...  yeah, I'm weird.  Deal with it. :)The BBQ on your table was interesting.  I thought that it was neat that the smoked wood was actually at our table and the food was cooked there.  I disliked the fact that you had to order two meats to have BBQ at your table, though.  What if you came in as a single and wanted to have the experience?  Seems kinda crummy that you'd have to order more food than you'd eat in a sitting just because that's their requirement.  I don't see how the profit margins could be such that I'd be required to order two meats when the cheapest one is $16.95.  I'm sorry, but a half pound of chicken + labor + overhead doesn't cost you $16.95.  I should be able to order one.Pricing aside, the BBQ sirloin, BBQ chicken, and BBQ short ribs were all decent but not crispy due to uneven heat from the coals.  Moreover, the server definitely wanted us to eat less-than-completely cooked chicken.  I suggest you be the judge not your server.  Anyhow, I'd rather take trips deep into Antioch for something better.Overall, if you don't live in Antioch or Nolensville, then I don't really see a reason to journey out to Seoul Garden.  I've heard there is a better Korean place on Charlotte Avenue downtown - but I don't know its name (one of the other people at my table was talking about it).",Seoul Garden,6154453613,348 reviews,2010-12-16,"Nashville, TN",/biz/seoul-garden-nashville-2,2.0,62,"Nashville, TN",David G.

"4928 Edmondson PikeNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"After living in LA for 17 years - I would say that I am obsessive about Korean BBQ. I was really surprised at the authenticity of the dishes and the depth of the menu at Seoul Garden.I could have closed my eyes and been in a Korean join in K-town LA. Easy.The hot coals for grilling is cool looking, but it does not really give you the constant heat you want for the meat to get nice and crispy on the outside.I would recommend ordering one meat dish at a time and NOT letting the server cook for you. They rush you. Put the meat on yourself and take your time, that is the beauty of Korean BBQ.As for the food itself - I was REALLY impressed and my taste bus were very happy. We had the Short rib and the bulgogi. We also had a Pork Kimchee dish ($12.95 - the one without tofu) that was a major winner. I will order that one again.There are a couple of things that are staples in the Korean restaurants in LA that I didn't see. A crisp green salad, god dipping sauces and the opportunity to cook the garlic cloves in the sesame oil (the shape of the grill prohibits it).Overall I loved it and I will go back to dive deeper into the menu.",Seoul Garden,6154453613,12 reviews,2010-05-18,"Nashville, TN",/biz/seoul-garden-nashville-2,4.0,62,"Nashville, TN",Sarah G.

"4928 Edmondson PikeNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"Decent Korean BBQ for Nashville but horrible service.  I've been to this restaurant twice now, each time receiving less-than-friendly service.  To sit at the grill tables, you'll have to order a minimum of 2 meat items which is understandable.  Two orders of meat will feed about 2-3 guests.   A plate of Bulgogi and Kalbi will run about $20/plate while Samgyeopsal costs about $17/plate.   Anybody that has eaten Korean BBQ at a more Asian populated city will know that's a bit pricier than normal.  But since we're in Nashville with limited choices, this is decent.  Seoul Garden uses hot coals instead of gas grills, so the servers will rush you to eat medium cooked meat to prevent too many grill plate changes.  If you like the meat crispy and not chew a piece of undercooked Samgyeopsal, please be prepared to receive some ""looks"" from the servers.They serve about 6-8 Banchan dishes which the servers have turned their nose if you ask for refills.  Please note that you'll have to specifically ask for how many orders of rice, they won't serve one per guest, unless you ask.  Also, even if you order 5 orders of meat at the grill table, asking for a 3rd helping of lettuce will result in a charge.  Final note, a 17% gratuity charge is automatically tacked on if you sit at the grill tables.If you're dying for the grill experience, give Seoul Garden a try.  If you don't care for it much, there are a few local joints that will serve it to you ready to eat with a smile.",Seoul Garden,6154453613,10 reviews,2010-01-20,"Somerset, NJ",/biz/seoul-garden-nashville-2,2.0,62,"Nashville, TN",Linda C.

Unless of course you enjoy playing sign language back and forth with your waitress because she speaks no English (which technically could be a good sign in a restaurant like this but was not.). This is especially not fun being a vegetarian and hoping that your hand signals do not betray you and your waitress bequeath you with a big bowl of meat. Luckily she interpreted well. However the food was not great. Not even the banchan was just okay.The weirdest part of the whole experience was that all of the non Korean customers were all grouped together in one corner (set apart with dividers) of the restaurant.

"451 Ponder PlaceNashville, TN 37228",4.5,"Let me try to make a slightly more helpful review...It's hard to convince co-workers to go to what someone will inevitably call a ""nursing home"" for lunch -- and I'm happy that I now have the necessary information to confidently sell this place when I'm feeling some good food.More than a meat-and-three, this place was for me a little bit more like going to Whole Foods for lunch, which I love to do.  There was a cold deli case with a selection of about 10 cold salads (fresh fruit, waldorf, tortellini with broccoli and cauliflower, potato, maybe a three-bean salad, two kinds of chicken salad -- curry and ""regular"" [see important note about that below -- and maybe another one or two that I'm forgetting.Then there was a selection of four or five hot entrees.  Today's were meatloaf, teriyaki chicken and rice, salmon croquettes, shepherd's pie, and chicken tetrazzini -- along with 2 or 3 hot vegetables/sides.The pricing was set up something like this:  meat and two for $5.50, meat and three for $6.50, cold salad sampler (choice of three) for $4.50 or $5.00.  All of those ""combos"" included cornbread or roll and drink (fruit tea was maybe $0.50 extra).  You could also purchase individual items very reasonably...I want to say $1.50 for a cold side, $2.50 for a hot side, and $3.50 for an entree.  Something close to that.My shepherd's pie was very good.  The only thing that would have made it a little better, for me, was something gravy-like to hold the meat together.  As it was, it was more ""loose-meat"" style on the bottom, but was well-seasoned.  The amount of meat was generous...there were onions in the mix and other than that only a few small pieces of potato that I remember.  It was topped, of course, with mashed potatoes and the top was nicely and evenly browned with a garnish of a single bias-cut scallion sliver on top.  The macaroni and cheese was OK.  A little loose and oily for my taste, but still good.  (I would prefer it that way to the soupy, really rich style.)  The broccoli, cauliflower, and tortellini salad I had was maybe day-old but still tasted good.One of my friends enjoyed the chicken tetrazzini, green beans, and corn I believe.  All of it looked very good.My other friend enjoyed the fresh fruit but couldn't say the same for the chicken salad.  After tasting it, I had to agree with her.  It looked great -- much like my mom made -- fine ground and on the drier side with celery and maybe a nut or two.  What I wasn't able to tell until I tasted it though, was the addition of bleu cheese!  I admit that I'm not a fan of the moldy stuff, but even so...it just didn't feel right to me at all.  AT THE VERY LEAST, this type of a ""polarizing"" ingredient that is not really visibly apparent should be called out on the menu -- no excuses.  I told her to take it back, but she was too ""nice"".  I have no doubt that it was fresh and well-prepared; if you're a huge bleu cheese fan you probably would love it.  But again, if you're going to monkeying around with something like chicken salad, please make sure that you clue everyone in!There were a few dessert selections in the case...a huge cheesecake brownie and something else -- carrot cake, I believe.  At the cash register were HUGE cookies that sounded great, but had the consistency of a very dry and stale biscuit.  If I want something sweet next time I go (and it will probably be soon,) I'll try one of the fresh made desserts in the case.The employees (probably the owners, but I'm not sure) were very friendly.  Judging from the people I saw there and its ""off-the-beaten-path"" location, it seems like there were mostly regulars that like to go there for a quiet lunch and would like to keep it that way.  We arrived at about 11:20...everything was hot and fresh, it was nice and quiet, and there was plenty of seating.  (And no senior citizens to speak of, if anyone of your party is phobic of them for whatever strange reason.)  If I find out that the seniors at the adjoining retirement home are getting this food every day, I think I'm going to make an early bird reservation for 2047 or so.[Credit cards accepted; $4 minimum.]",J&J Bistro,6152483804,32 reviews,2010-07-14,"Orlando, FL",/biz/j-and-j-bistro-nashville,4.0,2,"Nashville, TN",Adam M.

"6023 Nolensville PikeNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"In the past, Sushi O Sushi has been one of my favorite sushi spots in the Nashville area. I am particularly fond of the TNT and Salmon Heaven roll. Very fresh and yummy.However, it pains me to say that the service has gone down hill. I recently dined here on a Friday night with 3 other people and it was slow. We waited about 10 minutes before a server came to get our drink order and then another 20 to take a food order. On top of that, we waited an unusual amount of time for  food to be delivered to the table and it wasn't very busy. There only seemed to be two servers on the floor and they constantly looked overwhelmed. It took an additional amount of time to get our checks, and the place was practically empty at that point. If the place had been slammed, I would have understood. Not once did we even get a ""sorry about the wait"". It was as though they were completely oblivious to the situation. Everyone in our group was annoyed with the lack of service and we aren't hard people to please. The last couple times I have eaten here, I've noticed a similar decline in speedy service, but this evening had to be the worst. I've always been a fan of Sushi O Sushi and again, I think they have great food.

Same thing - slow getting attention, and I ordered exactly what I had every time before - sushi special with no octopus, squid, eel, or mackerel. About 10 minutes go by before the server came back to explain what ""chef's choice"" means on the sushi special. I finally just told her that I've ordered the exact same thing every time, and have never had a problem. She told me they couldn't do it, so I asked her to just cancel the order and we'd go somewhere else.  Eventually she came back and said they would do it ""this time.""Too expensive, for consistently terrible service, and mediocre quality anymore, especially when Sushime is directly across the street and is SO much better and better atmosphere.

I've been here a few times various nights of the weeks and have experienced prompt and friendly service, and for a small place I'm glad there has not yet been a wait for a table. Although it is not the best I've ever had, the sushi is pretty fresh tasting. It will satisfy your sushi fix for sure! Once you get past the overwhelming amount of options of specialty rolls, you will find average sushi prices and average tasting dishes. Usually we start out with the house salad & ginger dressing, which is pretty tasty. I've tried the rainbow roll, spicy tuna, philly roll and others that had really crazy names- i think fuji was one that I tried, overall consensus is to stay away from eel at this place.

While finishing my degree at Belmont late 80s and 90s, later while living close by in early 2000s I was there once or more per week. It is great for what it is: low cost steam -tray-held Thai food. Best bet for freshness is to order soup- noodle soup with vegetables, or lemongrass or chicken soup with rice for example. I personally like the Eggplant Curry or Tofu Curry when it is wayyyy over cooked. The chicken on a stick is not recommended. Fried foods at front of line are best when fresh which is rare.

"2010 Belmont BlvdNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"Wow some of these reviews are spot on.I called in an order of pad Thai with tofu and no egg around 3:30 on a Friday. When I arrived less than 10 mins later, it was ready to go. I also grabbed a vegetarian curry egg roll and a sweet rice cake from the buffet. My total was $11.75, which I thought was a really good deal for as much food as I got. There were all kinds of maneki nekko kitties and bobble heads that I wanted to check out but I was starving. I drove home and ate. First of all, the sweet rice cake. The flavor was fine. It reminded me of the rice cakes my friend's Filipino mother made for us growing up. Some of the rice was undercooked though so it was hard around the edges. The veg curry egg roll was different. Not as much curry flavor I expected which was kind of a bummer. The dipping sauce was almost honey-like in flavor but had a really watery consistency. Not like any Thai dipping sauce I've tried before. Not my favorite. And lastly, the pad Thai. This is where the other reviews come into play. The first couple bites seemed like your average Americanized pad Thai dish. It was alright. But some bites throughout tasted almost spoiled. The mung bean sprouts looked more like DUNG bean sprouts. (Budump chhhh! I'll be here all night, folks. On the couch, with an upset stomach) They were really dark (some black) and wilted, whereas fresh sprouts are white/green in color and crisp. There were maybe 6 total pieces of tofu and I truly couldn't tell if they were what tasted off or if it was the bean sprouts or a mix of everything.

"2010 Belmont BlvdNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"I was a Belmont student, so I came here when my other friends wanted to eat here. I'd come here alone if I was really craving (subpar) asian food. Hey, it's literally a one minute walk to get there from Belmont.So this place is a little market (packaged good, grocery, cooking utensils, and trinkets) and a restaurant. The food menu consists of a buffet line and a special menu. If I want cheap, greasy food, I go for the buffet line. I think I've had almost everything they've had to offer in the buffet. I usually end up topping it off with chilli sauce and Sriracha so it's spicy and has more flavor. The items on the Special Menu are made in the kitchen in the back. They cost about $8. They're ok, nothing to rave on and on about. Oh, and if ordering from the back, you can tell them if you want more or less or none of an ingredient. My friend loves fried garlic, so she always ask for that and to make it as spicy as possible. They are more than happy to attend to her request. I've been there enough to know that this place has regulars, and they seem pretty hardcore about it too.

"2010 Belmont BlvdNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"I finally came back to try the buffet. Sadly, I will have to give it a pass.First off, the food did not look appetizing. And this coming from someone like me who has spent 20 years being a loyal customer to various buffet-type places with heat lamps galore.My go-to Thai order is pad thai. And this version was exceedingly bland. I always like it when there are green onions in my pad thai; there were none in this version. No tofu, but there is scrambled egg -- even for the vegetarian version. Admittedly, I asked for it mild. But I somehow sense that had I ordered it spicy, the only difference would be the addition of chiles, rather than more sauce. Rather than throw the rest of the order away, I saved it for home, where I made my own pad thai sauce. I had thankfully brought over a few bricks of tamarind paste during my move from the West Coast. I neglected to buy Thai fish sauce here -- so I had to make my version with soy sauce rather than fish sauce. Regardless, I ended up with a pad thai with flavor -- too bad I had to add the flavor myself.I also had the chicken with some sweet sauce. This I could not enjoy at all. I like sweet sauces with my meat dishes. But when the consistency of the sauce reminds me of snot...well, I'm sorry, even I have boundaries. I like using corn starch when I make these types of sweet sauces, and I don't think it does that.  But I don't know what Thais use or what this restaurant uses to make it look like that.I did peruse a bit more at their little market. Bought some Chinese rice crackers that did remind me a little bit of my easier accessibility to these goods back home.I pass this place daily by bus...I will have to take a permanent pass on stepping inside.",International Market & Restaurant,6152974453,534 reviews,2011-11-18,"Loma Linda, CA",/biz/international-market-and-restaurant-nashville,1.0,75,"Nashville, TN",Ruiqiu K.
"2010 Belmont BlvdNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"For Nashville, this place has pretty decent Southeast Asian food for the price. (Of course, in a larger city, this place probably would be taken out by the competition... and this place is by no means trying to compete with even moderately upscale restaurants - for that, go to PM across the street which is owned by the same family) There is a cafeteria-style buffet with a fairly large selection, which is fresh for lunch but gets a little stale by the end of the dinner... $2 will get you a fairly large scoop of a dish such as spicy eggplant or tofu curry or vegetable fried rice. So for $4-6, you can really fill up! Quite affordable, and almost unbeatable in price for a quick meal. They also have many ""fresh-cut"" fruit and dessert options as well as various canned drinks like coconut juice and soy milk, as well as lots of Asian imported candies. Now, if the buffet food looks like it's been sitting out too long, you can order off the menu too... the menu is hard to find and isn't very much beyond your typical Pad Thai, noodle-soup , or curry dishes with your choice of protein, but at least it's made fresh to order. You order at the cash register, and they will bring it out to your table (or package it for carry-out). The dishes are almost all $8, and come out very quickly in decent portion size. The decor is, well, interesting. Half the store is taken up by Asian imported groceries and sundries - great for a quick purchase of a spice or sauce or lucky bamboo. If you're expecting formal or romantic dining, then this is not the place. Don't come here for an anniversary dinner! There is no waiter service, no tablecloths, just hard booths and old tables, so it's faster and cheaper that way.

I take that back.  I can't tell if the quality is horrible.  When you have food sitting out for hours, it hard to tell what it started out as.  So if they do use good ingredients, you definitely can't tell by the time it gets to your plate.  And if you stop by any other Asian market in town, you know they're marking up their prices way up there.  Food left out like that isn't safe, and the food that you order from the menu still comes out over cooked.  And if you're taking advantage of the college students there, then at least put some money back into the restaurant to update the equipment, furniture and decor.  College student may not have taste buds yet, but their eyes work just fine.  At least make it look like it's worth the money you're charging.",International Market & Restaurant,6152974453,95 reviews,2011-07-10,"Nashville, TN",/biz/international-market-and-restaurant-nashville,1.0,75,"Nashville, TN",Simon K.

"2010 Belmont BlvdNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"Great prices, great food, great people. That said, lets break it down...Food on buffet line: Ranging from reasonably good to amazing, her prepared dishes are full of flavor, very approachable, and very well priced. They have really added their own flare to many of these dishes with some delicious variations on things you may find elsewhere. The shining stars for me: the curried tofu and the seaweed salad. The tofu is bursting with flavor and just enough heat. The seaweed salad is the best I have ever had because i so beautifully balances the sweet, sour, and heat. Food to order: This place reminds me of my grandmother's house, if my grandmother were Thai. If they have the ingredients, they can make it. That said, there is not a specific menu with all of the things people like to order. From soups to noodle dishes, they do it all. My recommendation? Keep a very close eye on other people in line. They may be ordering the dish that will rock your world, but unless you watch, you won't know it exists. I could live in their Tom Yum soup. Try the veggie dumplings. I think the Beatles put it best when they said, ""..had I looked the other way I might have never been aware, but as it is I'll dream of her tonight""Patty's House Salad: Did you catch the article about it in the Scene? If not, allow me to blow your mind. Start the process by getting together a group of at least 4 to 6 people (the minimum and suggested maximum). Then call at least 2 days in advance and choose your meat, tofu, seafood, or whatever you want. Start preparing for an interactive feast. Patty comes out with somewhere in the neighborhood of 27 different ingredients. She then instructs you on how to fill a lettuce leaf appropriately some of every single ingredient and eat it in one bite. This was not a suggestion, but a requirement. You have to be willing to put absolutely everything into your wrap and stuff this gargantuan piece of loveliness into your mouth all at once. You will be glad of the challenge though, as each time you chew you get a different burst of flavor. This is genuine Thai family style. You spend most of your time walking around the table, stuffing food in your hand, then your mouth. You are strongly encouraged to go outside and walk around the block for fresh air from time to time. This allows things to settle a little so you can go back in for another round. Even though you will eat until you explode, it is SUPER FRESH and very light. Not that same old soul food coma afterward. The only downside is that it costs $30 per person. But with the amount of prep work and love that goes into this dish, it is totally worth it when you want to splurge a little and have one of the most incredible food experiences of your life. Market: A small but nice selection of Asian market items. The Gen Mai Cha (Green Tea with toasted rice) is a low grade, but super yummy and very cheap. Try the peanuts, coated in-house with honey, sesame seeds, and apparently something very addictive. There is a very nice assortment of curry pastes to play with and some very attractive Sake and tea sets. Don't forget to pick up a bottle of Sriracha while you're there. Everything is Miscellanea:   The decor is a ton of fun. Super casual, but laced with Thai treasures. Each table has an amazing set of condiments to customize your dish to perfection. They definitely take care of their regulars, so loyalty pays off here. There are some amazing seasonal treats. Fall brings coconut custard in baby pumpkins. You eat the pumpkin with the custard and it is both adorable and delicious. This place is not quite a 5 star for me because of several small imperfections, but I would still eat here almost every day if I still lived close enough.

"2010 Belmont BlvdNashville, TN 37212",3.5,"I'm not an Asian food aficionado by any means.  Though I do enjoy Chinese food, before moving to Nashville my main exposure to it was at the buffet line of various establishments typically run by Latinos that included taquitos, fried chicken, and chocolate pudding right next to the sweet and sour chicken.  International Market was my first taste of something different.Now, I know that International Market isn't the pinnacle of Asian cuisine.  It's not even my favorite Chinese restaurant in town (that honor goes to Chinatown near Green Hills Mall).  But International Market was there first, so it gets a nod.The staff at IM are always very quick and courteous, which considering this is a cafeteria style eatery, that puts you in the right state of mind right from the start.  The Chinese options are fairly typical fare, but they are all consistent and tasty.  I suggest the pepper steak over some fried rice if you're a first timer and not a vegetarian.  I'm also addicted to the chicken on a stick, because really, any food on a stick automatically gets points just for being on a stick, right?  And for dessert, skip the confections by the checkout counter, and opt instead for the fried sweet potatoes, lightly battered in tempura batter, which they've had all but one time when I've been there and are absolutely delicious.  I can't speak for the Thai options that IM has, but my girlfriend has had the Pad Thai with fried tofu on many occasions and has always enjoyed it.International Market may not be the best place in Nashville for Asian food, but for the price (we always eat for far less than twenty bucks) and the portions, you really can't beat it for a good, quick, cheap meal.",International Market & Restaurant,6152974453,46 reviews,2007-08-18,"Nashville, TN",/biz/international-market-and-restaurant-nashville,4.0,75,"Nashville, TN",Brett W.

"6317 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"Located next to Super Mercado.This food truck provides the best Mexican food in greater Nashville area. When I moved here from soCal 3 years ago, I constantly craved quality Mexican food that was plentiful back home. My two Mexican classmates (one from East LA and other from Fullerton) and I spent so much time and money looking for decent Mexican food in Nashville.After 6-8 months, we gave up on actual restaurant establishments throughout Nashville. They all catered to non-Hispanic clientele, substituted quality by slabbing beans and/or cheese, or were regularly devoid of customers overall (for good reason). Instead, the three of us tried EVERY Mexican food truck that we came across over the last three years. We were very religious about this. If one of us spot a Mexican food truck, we'd take note of the intersection and made sure we'd try it before the end of the week. I've eaten well over a dozen or two Mexican food trucks in Nashville over the years. One truck(s) came out consistently on top: Taqueria Express. I have two soCal Mexican friends to back that up (one of them surprisingly cooks very well).Even if several of these trucks populate the same block or two on Charlotte, Taqueria Express always had considerably more Hispanic customers. Even while waiting for my order, at least two or three cars would drive up, park, and place orders. This does not happen at other Mexican food trucks and I don't blame them: they're not as good as Taqueria Express.I'll be honest in stating that I've been disappointed by the rave reviews that a number of Mexican restaurant establishments have received on Yelp. That's why when it comes to ethnic foods in Nashville, I trust the crowding of ethnic customers more so than high scores on Yelp (ie Seoul Garden). Taqueria Express is another great example.Don't get me wrong, a few other Mexican food trucks will provide an item or two that will top Taqueria Express. Some tacos will be better found elsewhere, depending on your personal preference on the ratio and balance of various ingredients. But as a whole, the meats are more flavorful, more juicy, and remind me of the food I've eaten within 1 hour from the Mexican border.My personal favorite meats at Taqueria Express, in this exact order: 1 pollo (chicken), 2 pastor (spicy pork), and 3 beef (carne asada). I personally like the quesadillas, mulitas, sopes, and burritos.This is where my confusion lies. There are a small number of food trucks in Nashville called ""Taqueria Express"". With my limited Spanish (and their limited English), the employees have stated that these ""Taqueria Express"" trucks are from the same company. I'm not sure if they're all owned by one person who licenses out these trucks, if they're distributed as a franchise, or are jointly operated by the Mexican Mafia. If you look at the city licenses taped on each of these trucks, they're all registered with a slightly different name, address, or person. Yet the menu items are identical, the menu pictures are identical, the prices are similar, and if you ask the people who work there, they say they share the same recipes and ownership.I've asked each truck how many trucks are under the ""Taqueria Express"" company (my classmates have asked them in Spanish as well). Each truck has given a different number, whether it's 5, 6, 7, or 8, all in the greater Nashville area. My classmates and I have located, pinpointed, and eaten at exactly four of these Taqueria Express trucks. We have searched high and low for the remaining 1, 2, 3, or 4 trucks (your guess is good as mine). I'll post reviews of the three remaining Taqueria Express trucks (that I've found) on Yelp as well... I hope the Yelp gods and goddesses don't mind me copying and pasting since their food items are almost identical. ;-)I'm so happy to post this review--now I can finally check-in at Taqueria Express several times per week. I love the chicken quesadilla. Be warned though: a number of the non-English speaking customers will hand you their odd business cards for who knows what. I've collected a stack of business cards from other Mexican customers over the last 3 years. I have no idea what these businesses do. I don't speak enough Spanish and they don't speak enough English to explain to me what that's all about.Prices at the Charlotte location are a tiny bit higher than at the other three Taqueria Express locations. No idea why!",Taqueria Express,,116 reviews,2011-07-11,"Houston, TX",/biz/taqueria-express-nashville-2,5.0,13,"Nashville, TN",Tin N.

"6688 Nolensville PikeNashville, TN 37027",4.5,"My wife and I love going to hibachi restaurants, and have been to several in the area. We noticed this one when coming out of Kroger about a week ago, and wanted to give it a try. I looked online and found some good reviews so after work on Friday we tried it out. When we arrived there weren't a lot of people, so we were a little concerned but when we were greeted our concern was put to ease. They had friendly service, a good menu and a really nice layout. Our ""cook"" came over and was very friendly ( we had our 2 year old and he went out of his way to get her name and include her ), the ""show"" was one of the better I'd seen and the food was great. Seasoned well, and tasted excellent. One of the people at our table ( not in our party ) didn't like onions and they did a great job ensuring she was taken care of. Overall it was a great dinner, and I know we will be back. My only disappointment was how empty it was, part of the experience is the ""electricity"" of other tables. I had heard the prior restaurant there wasn't good and I know people can be scared to go back again, but I assure you if you like hibachi you will enjoy your time here. On a side note I worked in restaurants for over 18 years and am normally highly critical of service, food and environment....these guys get high marks on all three.

Minami was fairly decent for just a nearby hibachi place when you wanted something different without having to go too far, but they are now under new management. The family who owns Sushi O Sushi in Lennox Village bought this place and remodeled it and changed the menu. It has really improved. The sushi is so much fresher and the chef is amazing. We loved him at the other place and we're so glad he's here now. They have a good variety of sushi rolls without being overwhelming, and all the standards, of course. Delicious. The miso soup is great. Before the changeover, it was just broth and some scallions, but Oya's soup definitely has more substance. The new level of quality extends to the hibachi as well. It's not high-dollar hibachi, but it's very good for a little neighborhood restaurant. It's nice to have something so close by that's fun and different. You can order all the hibachi meals at the regular tables in the sushi area as well, and that's nice when you're not in the mood for the show.

"217 Largo DrNashville, TN 37211",2.5,"Came here for dinner with a few coworkers when we were having to work late. This is the first time I've been to a Hooters in years.I had a chicken sandwich. Hooters is supposedly known for their chicken, right? So ordering it in sandwich form should have been a safe bet, right? Nope. All I tasted was salty grease with a bit of cheese. If dinner had been coming out of my pocket instead of an expense account, I would have been terribly disappointed. One of my dining partners had some boneless wings which he described as ""blah""  and the others didn't seem terribly impressed with their selections either.What really got me was how incredibly long it took to get our food. It wasn't very busy; I'd say maybe 50% of tables were filled at most. Yet it took forever for our mediocre food to come. Absolutely do not come here if you're under any sort of time constraint; you'll be late. Our server was as prompt with things as she could be and the food was piping hot when it arrived, so I'm inclined to believe that the wait was due to a slow kitchen rather than slow service. In fact, our friendly server was the only redeeming aspect of eating here. She was very nice, stayed on top of our drinks, and did her best despite the dismally slow kitchen.Not really planning on coming here again..",Hooters,6153310842,62 reviews,2013-10-24,"Murfreesboro, TN",/biz/hooters-nashville-3,2.0,17,"Nashville, TN",Leigh M.

"217 Largo DrNashville, TN 37211",2.5,"Cheap and bad attitude. Ah where did you heard this before? Right, at every Hooters. I've been to this location many times, with big groups (guys and girls) and girls only. When I went with the guys, the service was top-notch. We had 3-4 girls served our table. They kept refill our drinks and brought out the wings even before we asked for them. I guess the guys I hung out with were big rollers. It was the opposite when I went with my girlfriends. The waitress  rarely stopped at our table and when we asked for new plates and utensils, she snarled at us ""For what!?"" and stopped going to our table after that. Yo, I've never expected good customer service at places like Hooters but damn girl, you need a chill pill. Let's talk about the food. The men said, ""They have good chicken."" Well, we all know they were just showing their BS skill and I'm not talking about a college degree. Chickens here are the worst. Too greasy and too much breading. After all these negative remarks, I bet you're wondering why I didn't just go ahead and give them one star. The Buffalo Sliders are what saving them from it. These are the truth! Get them with the fries and you won't be disappointed. Half-shell oysters were tiny and average. If you want good oysters, try the Southern Steak & Oysters. The Drunken Mussels (bathed in butter) were a scam ($9.99). I found about 8-10 pieces of mussels and there were about 20+ shells. I believe these were frozen as I had the exact mussels at Costco before ($3.99). They have a nice beach volleyball court in the back. Great for big groups. Half-price appetizers start at 10 PM.Cheap food.

"217 Largo DrNashville, TN 37211",2.5,"At the end of a long Labor Day, on which me and my wife were celebrating our 2nd anniversary, with people following our random updates about where we were / what we were doing on various sites, we decided to come here.  Mostly as it was the most twisted end to a rainy night that had started at Holland House, went through the dripping cave of Italia in East Nashville, now it was time for Hooters.I don't think I'd been to a hooters in 10 years or so. Being a vegetarian there's not much to eat there, and being somewhat a realist I find it a little odd to go to a restaurant specifically to look at the scantily clad waitstaff... something about orange shorts and crazy bras doesn't do it for me.However, it was the perfect time to go, if just for a beer and a check-in that would make people laugh (it did) and a story ""yup, that's what we did on our second"".We got there, sat at the bar, I was reminded that this was not really my thing but we were having a fairly fun time. A waitress and I guess a patron were playing a game of Wii baseball on a red Nintendo Wii. I thought that was pretty amusing in itself until she got a home run and then... well... it wasn't exactly Man Show Girls on Trampolines, but close. A cacophonous shriek went up, and the waitress did some sort of short catwalk of victory jiggle back and forth... making enough noise that all eyes went there.Had that been it, I would have thought it just exuberance for the run batted in. 3 more times. Holy hell I've never seen anyone continue to be so excited that they were beating a customer 4-0. I sort of felt it would have been appropriate at the end of that show to toss a dollar or two at her or suggest she go on the price is right.We had our couple of beers, read the menus, contemplated getting a shirt but decided against it. Realized the prices really were quite reasonable if chicken was your thing.It was fun.. if chicken, orange shorts and beer are your thing, this is the place to go.",Hooters,6153310842,573 reviews,2011-09-14,"Nashville, TN",/biz/hooters-nashville-3,4.0,17,"Nashville, TN",Paul K.

Not so much today.Overall, this visit was no disappointment, service was quick and friendly, food was as expected and price was quite reasonable.  I'm probably not going to eat for the rest of the day.  My whole meal, including fresh squeezed OJ was less than $12, no complaints there!",Cracker Barrel Old Country Store,6158835440,61 reviews,2014-04-09,"Moreno Valley, CA",/biz/cracker-barrel-old-country-store-nashville-2,5.0,52,"Nashville, TN",Maggie F.
"2406 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"I feel like cracker barrel is a great place to go to when you have a hangover. Nothing like cheap greasy breakfast food to cheer up a splitting headache. The store gives you plenty of junk to play with while you wait or if you're really hung over a nice rocking chair to get some much needed fresh air.The menu seems to be made up of endless combinations of about 12 different choices. Nothing new, just staple American breakfast choices usually in portions that make you need to loosen a belt buckle and start an aspirin regiment if you were to eat the whole thing.Family friendly and its always packed.

"2406 Music Valley DrNashville, TN 37214",3.5,"This is the good old homestyle cooking that my hubby sometimes favors.  I ordered the shrimp with coleslaw.  He ordered the chicken and dumplings with green beans and corn.I did not like our waiter.  As soon as we sat down, he asked us if we knew what we wanted to order.  We told him no, and he went to get our drinks.  30 seconds went by, our faces were looking down at the menu, and he asked us if we knew what we wanted to order yet.  I, again, told him NO.  This annoyed me.  Obviously he was a total moron.  People who are staring down at a menu most likely do not know what they want to order.My fried shrimp were much smaller than I expected.  I have never had small fried shrimp before (I am not much of a homestyle cooking restauranteur), but they were decently tasty.  I also liked my coleslaw.  The hubby was very happy with his chicken and dumplings.  I was happy stealing some of his sides.  For some reason, I like grossly overcooked green beans.  They are much tastier this way.So as soon as our dinner arrives, the waiter slaps down the bill.  This further annoys me.  I tell him we are going to order dessert.  He asks me if we know what we want to order.  I told him NO and that I wanted to finish my dinner first.  I knew if I gave him an order, our dessert would be out 2 minutes later.  I did not appreciate how rushed we felt by this idiot.  I noticed that he was treating his other tables the same way.  Management should really talk to him about his customer service.After we were done with dinner, we ordered the mixed berry cobbler.  It was just okay.  I make much better at home.  The food was pretty good, but the service was fairly lousy.  I don't like feeling rushed when I am eating dinner and the place was not all that busy.",Cracker Barrel Old Country Store,6158835440,531 reviews,2011-08-20,"Redondo Beach, CA",/biz/cracker-barrel-old-country-store-nashville-2,3.0,52,"Nashville, TN",Kat M.

The place was not crowded. Of course we were seated right away.Oh, deja vu.  I felt walking into  the store, I was back in Colorado and never left, except when the employees started speaking.  They had a southern twang instead of a western drawl.  Our friend asked us if we remembered Cracker Barrel Tchotchkes!, (we lived many years in NYC), from  about 20 years ago . We all said yes, and felt the trinkets and ""collectibles"" were different and unique, now they seem too standardized and commercialized.Late Lunch, As always the food was well prepared, Plate of Biscuits and Corn bread, hot and delicious, actually tasted better than back in Colorado. I'm thinking the humidity in Nashville contributed to the extra texture and taste as well as the Southern Drawal.I ordered the Half lb burger (medium) with onion rings. It's a shame that restaurants now a day make it standard procedure to cook beef at least medium.  My preference with beef is medium rare.  Overall burger had a wonderful charred taste, the Onion rings, absolutely delicious, crunchy, huge and plentiful!!!My wife ordered country ham, potato cheese casserole, apple sauce, and Double Chocolate Fudge Coca-Cola® Cake.  It was the first time she tried the Coca Cola Cake.  She absolutely loved it. I have a feeling it's going to be one of her standard desserts now!!  She always picks Cracker Barrel restaurants to visit when we travel the states.  She says she knows a town is civilized if there is a Cracker Barrel Restaurant in that locale!!! Our friend Lori, ordered chicken spinach salad with vinaigrette dressing.  Also delicious as always.Forgot what my other friend ordered.  Overall we enjoyed our experience at Cracker Barrel restaurants.  The service and and servers did a good jobI rate Cracker Barrel restaurants by my wife's experience.  It's not my style of restaurant, nor is it my restaurant choice.

"618 Church StNashville, TN 37219",3.0,"My husband surprised me by making reservations here for our 6th Anniversary. We arrived and they personalized our menu by writing ""Happy 6th Anniversary"" at the top of the menu which was a thoughtful touch BUT they also printed the incorrect date. The table had confetti spread on top which made it feel more like a New Years Eve bash than a romantic anniversary dinner.We started with a bottle of wine which was just ""ok"" and with a $70 price tag we were hoping for more. Typically I feel steak houses have decent bread and we were both starving so we were excited when this huge loaf was brought to our table but it was horrible! The taste was bland and it wasn't even warm. We both started with our own shrimp cocktail appetizer and it was delicious! Well with the price. The shrimp were HUGE!I ordered the salmon and asked for it to be ""cooked all the way through"" but apparently that means burn it to the point that it's so dry it has no taste! It was barely edible. My husband ordered a mix grill which consisted if a steak, bacon-wrapped scallops and shrimp which he said was overall ""good.""We then ordered 2 sides: the Brussel sprouts and asparagus with a balsamic glaze. The asparagus was delicious! But the Brussel sprouts had bacon cooked with them and I don't eat bacon. Since the menu didn't state they had bacon I thought when I requested another order sans bacon they would bring it at no charge. Well that wasn't the case. So we spent $26 on 2 sides of Brussel sprouts. And the sprouts didn't even come out till I was almost finished with my dried out, now cold, salmon. We did receive a complimentary desert since it was our anniversary and it was yummy. Chocolate molten cake with ice cream.

"618 Church StNashville, TN 37219",3.0,"I'm dreading writing this review. Honestly, the food was fantastic (some of the best prosciutto the hubs and I've ever had), the drinks were well-crafted (hello, Secret Garden cocktail), even our waitress (whose name escapes me) made sure we were well attended to. So, why the one-star rating, you ask? Well, it's simple, friends. Customer service and human decency go a LONG way.Basically, 16 of us dined this evening for my hubby's company holiday party. Several appetizers, entrees, and sides (and cocktails!) later, we racked up a $2000 tab and were well on our way to ordering desserts.Relevant sidenote: The hubs' boss is undergoing chemo treatments for a bout of cancer that has left him with a cold sensitivity, especially with the typical hair loss. When he put on a wool beanie in the restaurant to keep warm, he was immediately asked to remove it... which he did. When his family mentioned his condition and questioned the treatment from Catrina, the assistant manager, they were told he could wear it if he presented a doctors' note... or if we had given them previous notice so we could be accommodated elsewhere. (Out of sight, out of mind?)In short, what followed was shock/disbelief (can't say that I blame them) and the cops being called (huh?), and we were (all 16 of us) asked to leave.On our way out, my protective spouse asked the manager if we looked like criminals. To which he responded, ""the cops just patrol this area and decided to check in."" Riiiight.So. I reiterate: Customer service and human decency go a LONG way. I've been in Nashville close to 15 years and I really hate to think that the city I love has an establishment so pretentious that they would discriminate against someone with a life-threatening condition.

"618 Church StNashville, TN 37219",3.0,"Finally. Finally. Finally. I have waited for years to have dinner at Morton's. Thanks to a celebration dinner was served in the ""private"" Boardroom of this Church Street establishment. It was my first time in the building after Castner-Knott vacated it a couple of years ago (wink). Dinner started with a round of drinks that ranged from fine wines, water, sodas, coffee and few in the party had Blue Moon and Miller Lite. The Prime Ocean appetizer platters were served family style and included cold and baked seafood. I especially enjoyed baked scallops wrapped in bacon. They were perfectly cooked and simply flavored for memorable experience. The crusted baked Shrimp and Shrimp Cocktail was served by an amazing cocktail sauce that became a dip for the giant onion bun served. The Oysters Rockerfeller was okay, but nothing spectacular. The steamed lobster was tasteless and very chewy. The condiment offerings compensated for the overcooked lobster. The Caesar Salad and the Bibb Lettuce Salads were very large in portion. Each individual order could have and should have been shared. The steakhouse favorite, Caesar was served with very clean, cold, and crisp Romain and heavily coated with a ""just right"" traditional dressing. The anchovies were unnoticeable (as they should be). The generous sized Parmesan shavings seemed fresh and was mild in flavor. The two sliced croutons were well prepared and gave the nice crunch to the salad. The Bibb Lettuce Salad was easily at least ONE FULL HEAD of Bibb dressed with a sweet dressing. The Bibb was accented with some cheese and walnuts. I think that the two salads shared between four guests would be plentiful and give a balance of sweet and savory dressings. The server suggested the Cajun Ribeye that marinates for a lengthy time. However, I wanted to experience the simple majestic taste of Midwestern beef and ordered the Filet Mignon. The meat arrived cooked to a perfect medium (nice sear on the outside and warm red in the middle). It seems that the only seasoning was salt and pepper and the steak was wonderful. Of course, the meat was tender and melted like butter in my mouth. The sides were served up family style and just simple spoonful of a few was plenty to eat. The best side of the night were the Sautéed Brussels Sprouts with bacon. They were a bit overcooked, but BS craze prevailed they were still very good. The Twice Baked Gratin was simply potatoes covered in cheese and bacon...and almost perfect. The Creamed Corn was sweet and creamed well with a mix of spice and some sausage for an average experience. The Grilled Asparagus were the very thick variety and required the sauce served with the dish...meh. The desserts were perfect as they were classic without being fussy. The Hot Chocolate Cake (saucy chocolate, molten lava) was certainly the best dessert with a scoop of Häagen-Dazs Vanilla Ice Cream. The richness of the chocolate was not overpowered by the sweetness that is typical with this dessert. It was very, very, very good. The Creme Brûlée with the specks of vanilla bean was simply prepared, smooth, and mildly flavored...perfect. The Chocolate Mousse was European style which is not as sweet as American style...it, too, was perfect. The coffee was simple, nothing fancy, but was helpful between the various samplings of so many wonderful desserts. Our dinner part of 16 was served by a delightful server and she was assisted by a couple of other servers. The service was very good without being pretentious or too casual. Glasses were never empty. And, even better, conversations were never interrupted among the dinner guests, but plenty of interaction was shared between us and the server. The server knew how to work with us for three and half hours. Very cool.I wasn't impressed with ambiance of the place. It seemed to lack a sense of warmth that ""incandescent"" lights should provide. I suggest lowering the lights a little and adding better candles to the place.

"618 Church StNashville, TN 37219",3.0,"Came for a corporate event and was not expecting the best. Great crab cake apps, could not stop eating them. Only option was Caesar salad and only steak option was the filet. Salad was run of the mill and looked like they rushed to plate it. The filet was a disaster; ordered med-rare and they brought out well done. Had to wait 20 mins for another one while the rest of the table was eating. Steak came out medium instead but was too hungry to send it back again. Filet was lukewarm, no sear and under seasoned. I think they massed cooked the filets in the oven knowing that it was a corporate event. Ordered berry dessert and had a sundae cup with 3 half strawberries with whip cream. Did not bother to eat.

"618 Church StNashville, TN 37219",3.0,"I took my wife to Morton's for our anniversary. It's a bit out of my price range usually, but thankfully I had a gift card to lessen the blow this trip. I had never dined at Morton's before; I've made a run of all the high-end steakhouses in this city and across the US, but somehow Morton's slipped through the cracks. Shame on me. We started our meal with a cocktail. My wife's Lemon Drop was well made, it was the perfect balance of sweet and tart and the bartender obviously freshly squeezed the lemon juice, as there were bits of lemon pulp throughout the martini. I've never met a dirty martini I didn't like, and this one was no different. My martini had just enough olive juice and was so well-shaken it not only had ice shards, but the ice had almost started to refreeze before I got the martini. I hope the bartender had some insulated mixing tins because shaking a martini that much gets the hands cold rather quickly. We moved from cocktails into the appetizer. It was the only part of the meal that was not perfectly prepared. The scallops were underdone. I know, I know, scallops aren't supposed to be cooked til they're chewy, but there is done and not done. They obviously used too hot of a pan to sear the scallops...the outside was the perfect golden brown color, but because the temperature was too high the scallops browned before they were done. Scallops shouldn't still be cold in the middle when they make it to the table. I would almost think that perhaps Morton's used frozen scallops that hadn't quite thawed all the way. Thankfully the server noticed rather quickly my wife's reaction to her first bite and apologized and had the kitchen prepare us another order. The second time they were perfect. Our salads were excellent; my wife's Caesar wasn't overly dressed, a welcome change from most restaurants. I LOVED the Morton's Salad; I usually hate anchovies whole or chopped, but I loved them here. The creamy zing of the bleu cheese was the perfect complement to the salty anchovy. My wife and I each ordered the filet. Both my extra rare and her medium were perfectly prepared. I am sure that if I had a thermometer the centers of the steaks would've temped perfectly; kudos to Morton's. Even the high-end steakhouses struggle with extra rare sometimes. All too often a grill cook hears extra rare and either thinks the guest wants it seared, or the grill cook just cooks a normal ""rare"". Thankfully Morton's had no trouble. This was definitely the best filet I have had in Nashville. We finished our meal with the lava cake; paired with espresso it was a fittingly decadent end to our meal. Almost every aspect of our meal was perfect; minus the hiccup with the scallops this would be a five star rating. The service, the drinks, the atmosphere; all was perfect for a romantic evening with my wife.

When the bartender returned, my friend asked if she could place her order and was told ""There are lots of other people ahead of you."" Actually, no. But ok.

"618 Church StNashville, TN 37219",3.0,"What a shame!  My husband and I have eaten at Mortins for special occasions a number of times and we've never had a bad experience.  So when my parents came in to town from Florida we decided to treat them to Morton's. We went when they had the special $49 four course meal... My husband wanted to change out the salad for the French onion soup which was offered as an appetizer to begin with. The main reason is my husband really cannot handle eating any kind of salads  And he explained this to the server.We were told absolutely not!  This was surprising since we had eaten at Morton's a number of times and we had never had any trouble Requesting this substitution. My husband was in the food industry for a number of years and he understands the cost of meals and the profitability factor so this was a fair exchange... Especially since we had ordered several martinis and also I was drinking wine.  The server forgot to bring my wine and a totally separate person had to get it for me. Then whenever the server would stop by our table it was if she was breezing by... Finally at the end... My husband complained to Cory the Manager.  He said that if we had gotten the $59 special we could've exchanged out for the $11 soup of which there was no indication that any other special was going on. In fact, in the front room there was a big easel with only the $49 special being advertised So one would've thought that this mysterious $59 special would've come up in the course of conversation with the server no?

"618 Church StNashville, TN 37219",3.0,"If you've read any of my other reviews before, you know I love me some late night dining trips.  I work long days in lab and by the time I get home and do the things I have to do, it's late, and I don't always feel like cooking.  Or, I don't have time to eat before some event/show/game/concert I'm attending and so after enduring a growling stomach for hours I am on the prowl for something to enjoy after hours, when there are less people and I can relax more. So once again I have to say, I have never eaten the traditional dinner at Morton's.  Morton's is where I go after a show at the Ryman or TPAC, to sit at their bar with their excellent and experienced bartenders, to enjoy their bar bites menu.  Though as always, I find great small plates a bug indicator of how good their big plates must be.  And the steak ALWAYS smells HEAVENLY coming from the kitchen.But here's pretty much a great night for me: a ballet, musical, opera, or play at TPAC, following by a stroll through downtown Nashville to end at the Morton's bar.  This all feels very NYC to me, and it's a really great, fun, and intimate date or catch-up time with a friend.  I've already professed my love of oysters and you can get them on the half shell at the bar.  I adore their crab cake BLTs and mini filet sandwiches.  These are great plates to share.  They change up the bites occasionally, and I've had a great salmon and lox-style flatbread here before.  You can order from the full menu at the bar as well (I've never done it but I've witnessed others do it).  But late in the evneing, sometimes a smaller yet decadent meal is called for.  Their drinks (from aforementioned fantastic bartenders) are perfectly prepared and always kept full if you so desire.  The bar is quieter, typically, and just a great place to be overall.  The large windows allow for great people watching as well, which again to me feels so New York.  This place has the old-boys-club kind of steakhouse feel while still being not so chain restaurant like (even though this place IS a chain) and I like that.The food is delicious, the service top-notch, and the setting classy...so grab a seat at the bar and give it a try!",Morton’s The Steakhouse,6152594558,299 reviews,2012-10-18,"Nashville, TN",/biz/mortons-the-steakhouse-nashville,5.0,98,"Nashville, TN",Bridgette C.

The servings are generous even though they are called Bites so we decided to share a few.   We went with the Crab Cake BLT ($6 HH), Petite Filet Sandwiches ($6 HH), and Blue Cheese Steak Fries ($5 HH). While the Crab Cake BLT had a little too much crab for my taste (a good problem to have), Cole loved it, specifically the quality and crispiness of the bacon. One tip if you try the BLT, order extra mayo, as the combination of the bread, crab, and bacon, can be a little on the dry side. The Filet Mignon sandwiches come on a soft sesame bun with a pile of perfectly cooked filet mignon and are as delicious as they sound and a steal for the $6 price.

First off: parking.  You can find some street parking depending on what time you go and how patient you are.  I got there at 6pm and I am also the most impatient person on the planet...sooo valet to the rescue.  The valet guys were friendly and I didn't fear leaving my car with them.  Too much anyway.The bar area looks pretty cool and I did note that there was a happy hour special in the bar with appetizers and various other things for $6 each.  Apparently there are drink specials too.  Sounds like a good idea - definitely want to try that out sometime.So we were seated in a private room that looks as though it would hold about 30 people depending on configuration.  We had Caesar salad to start and it was decent - lots of dressing, some croutons, cracked black pepper.  For my entree I obviously got the filet, medium rare.  It came with mashed potatoes and garlic green beans.  The steak was cooked perfectly - hot red middle.  Overall lacking some oomph but not a bad steak.  They brought out some creamy sauce for it also (can't remember exactly what it was) but I didn't like it and removed it from my steak.  I guess I should always remember I don't like white creamy things eh?  For dessert we were sent home with cheesecake.  I didn't get a choice and I don't really like cheesecake that much but it wasn't bad.  No sauce, just a strawberry on top.  I would have liked it better with some sauce on it.  Overall liked the location downtown and liked the way the restaurant looked, especially the bar area.  The food didn't wow me but it certainly made me willing to come back and try some things on my own dime.  Yay, I'm no longer a Morton's hater!!",Morton’s The Steakhouse,6152594558,1027 reviews,2011-06-27,"Nashville, TN",/biz/mortons-the-steakhouse-nashville,3.0,98,"Nashville, TN",Nickie G.

"618 Church StNashville, TN 37219",3.0,"The problem with high end steak houses such as Morton's is that people go there with very high expectations and are ready to pay good sums for the things they have been hearing here and there. My expectations very very high and I was ready to pay. Unfortunately, Morton was not able to meet my very high expectations. I ordered a salad assuming the portions are ""human"" size. Well it turns out the portions at Morton's are a little larger than what I refer to as human portions. The salad itself could have been enough for me but since I was there for the steak, i only had 1/10th of the salad. I ordered filet and asked it to be medium and although it was more on the well done side, I was somewhat happy with it. The sides of asparagus was pretty good and very generous. By the time it was time for desert, I was already full but could not resist the chocolate cake with ice cream which was nothing special.Overall, I was somewhat satisfied with my experience here but would expect better quality for the price. The problem with my experience at Morton is that they gave me the impression that Morton is more about quantity than being about the quality of food.

"618 Church StNashville, TN 37219",3.0,"Loved it!  I dined with my husband and another couple this past weekend to celebrate friend's birthday.  This was my first time dining at Morton's and I had been hyped up about it from my friend.  Needless to say, I was not disappointed.  I enjoyed every minute from the moment we walked in to the sad walk out. They greeted us, took a picture for the birthday boy then immediately seated us in a comfortable grand booth!  Our server was the WONDERFUL Christopher.  He knew the menu backwards and forwards and was very convincing on the items we asked about.  And humorous on top of that.  So we were lucky to get a great server to make dining experience even more enjoyable.  But as with all meals, it is about the food and this food was fantastic.  I had it in my mind that it was going to be similar to Fleming's and now I feel it exceeds Fleming's high standards.The onion bread loaf was fresh, fluffy and delicious.  I only wish it was served with an oil for dipping instead of butter.  However, I enjoyed it with no accompaniments.  My husband ordered the center cut iceberg salad with their house made thousand island dressing- I was impressed.  The portion size was incredible.  Him and I ended up sharing it because it was so large.  Our companions enjoyed their caesar salad and lobster bisque.   I ordered the Filet Oscar cooked medium, which had two small filets on top of a potato with asparagus and fresh lobster on top covered in a creamy sauce.  Even though I was stuffed, I wanted more because it was so good. My husband ordered the double cut filet, medium rare and said it was the best steak he's had in a restaurant.  We ordered the sauteed spinach & mushrooms and green beans for sides to share- both also very good and filling.  We skipped dessert, but the waiter brought out a massive slice of New York style cheesecake for the birthday boy, which they said was awesome as well.  Seemed to be the running theme for the night!Worth the price tag.  Wonderful meal.  We will be back!",Morton’s The Steakhouse,6152594558,270 reviews,2010-03-10,"Fort Myers, FL",/biz/mortons-the-steakhouse-nashville,5.0,98,"Nashville, TN",Mandy C.

"618 Church StNashville, TN 37219",3.0,"So I pretty much went to Morton's based on some reccomendations and the mere fact that it's one of the few remaining steakhouses I've been to in Nashville.  I've still yet to check out Kayne Prime or Stockyard (ain't gonna happen) and I could be missing one..  I'll try to focus on this experience alone and compare it to other competitors towards the end....We showed up early enough to have a drink at the bar but our hostess seated us right away which was fine with me.  I'd say for a Wednesday the crowd wasn't bad at 7:15..  The bar was fairly full with the dining room close to 50% capacity..  I like a little atmosphere chatter so it was just fine with us.  It worked out even better as I requested that my wife and I be moved to a small table as opposed to one of their large booths because we wanted to face each other rather than sit side by side.  Our server was very accomodating of course.  Her name was Cheryl and she was very prompt and personable the entire evening.  One thing I HATE is when the entrees are dropped right after the soup/salad and we easily had 15 - 20 minutes to enjoy ourselves and the evening in it's entirety was paced perfectly.  Absolutely no complaints there.  We started with Louisiana Shrimp and split the Onion soup so we would have plenty of room for our Steak/King Crab Legs.  I ordered our bone-in-ribeye Rare Plus which in my experience (I can't cook but I know what it's supposed to look like) is a pretty difficult task but Morton's absolutely NAILED it.  Very impressive.  Despite that though, I don't feel the urge to get into each dish because I just don't feel like anything was truly memorable.  Everything was ""very good""..  But the problem with that is I'm not spending $300 on dinner/drinks to have a ""very good"" meal..  I've had GREAT meals at Flemming's, Ruth's Chris, Red Pony and even Stoney River for easily a $100 less.  I don't want to give a negative review because there was truly nothing negative about our experience..  But my thing is, if you're going to drop that kind of cash on dinner, which I only do 3 - 4 times a year, I want it to blow my socks off.",Morton’s The Steakhouse,6152594558,14 reviews,2012-10-11,"Nashville, TN",/biz/mortons-the-steakhouse-nashville,3.0,98,"Nashville, TN",Ben Z.

When we went to Nashville for a conference, it was super convenient because it was right behind our hotel.  The short review: Tasty food, cooked perfectly, flavorful. Huge portions, so share, share, share! Awesome service.The long review:  We walked in and at first I considered leaving because the host/greeter was rude. We just got off an airplane, it was raining buckets, and it was like 85 degrees of humid hotness outside. We are from Cali, rude guy, we're not used to this crap. Cut us a break. So we weren't in suits or business attire, but we still have money. He gave us the once over and said in his best snooty voice, ""Um, we can see you in about 30 minutes. Or you can go to the bar. They have menu service too.""  We just went to the bar because like I said, hungry, just got off a plane, don't care if I eat on a mat on the floor, just give me food.Our server, Keith, was AWESOME! He made good conversation and clued us in to some places to check out while we were in town. He had great recommendations. The food. Try the lobster bisque. It is the creamiest, smoothest, perfectly peppery with a hint of brandy. Served with a large chunk of lobster meat. We got a claw. Delicious. Best I've ever had.  The prawn cocktail was good, 4 huge prawns, clean, chilled.  The cocktail sauce could use more horseradish, but I like my cocktail sauce to bring me to tears.  My husband thought it was fine.  We shared a porterhouse (single cut) and got a side of steamed asparagus with hollandaise.  The porterhouse was done perfectly, excellent flavor.  The asparagus was just ok. It was a little too thick, and the woody stems were shaved down, but still not good to eat, in my opinion. I've made better hollandaise at home.  I would love to try the grilled asparagus with balsamic reduction next time.We ordered the Hot Chocolate Cake to finish.  When it came out I was underwhelmed. It looked so innocent and unassuming, and I thought it was going to look different.  BUT... when we dug into it, it was all melty and chocolatey and hot.  It was a passionate food. When hubby and I took our first bites, we met eyes and it was that look like ""Yum. This is good. We're gonna have sex later.

"618 Church StNashville, TN 37219",3.0,"I was so excited to eat at Morton's, but I must say it did not meet my expectations. We had a tray of raw oysters, which had a very salty, oceany, bitter taste I have ever tasted in oysters. Normally I love oysters, but these just had something amiss about them. The lobster bisque was good, but not outstanding by any means. I ordered my steak very rare, but the waiter insisted that they cook them so rare already i should just order it medium rare. Mistake. It was fine in the middle, but the outer portion was too cooked for my taste, plus it was kind of cold when it arrived. My friend's steak was even colder.

"618 Church StNashville, TN 37219",3.0,"I was taken here for the first time this week and I have to say I was really impressed.  From the minute you walk in the door to the point where your waiter first greets you, the people are very professional and friendly. Instead of being handed menus here, the waiter will roll a cart over to your table and show you what your options are for dinner.  The 4lb Lobster on a silver platter was moving around and eyeing you, which at the same time made you not exactly want to eat it... but added a nice touch that you see your Maine lobster was alive and fresh.  You also have a tray filled with all cuts of beef... including a bone-in double cut filet.  If only I could afford a $60 steak..    Then they also have the salmon and the tuna.. but come on, who's gonna order salmon for dinner at a steak restaurant?  So after the waiter unsuccessfully tried to persuade the lobster to ""kill"", he decided to give us our ""cheat sheet"" menus (which included the price so you could know what kind of damage to expect later).  He also then told us about the internet special that he told us we saw on the internet...  which for $99 we got two small filets (seriously, there was nothing small about them), two starters, two salads, two sides, and two desserts.  This is an amazing deal.  Its way more food than you can possibly eat (since they start you off with this delicious loaf, yes loaf, of onion bread) and its a total steal considering the fact that its easy for 1 person to eat for that price when ordering al a carte.  I had a house salad, small filet, shrimp with a lemon beurre blanc, steamed gigantic asparagus with a hollandaise sauce, pan fried potatoes with caramelized onions, and key lime pie.  (the sides are designed to be shared with another person).  I left with enough leftovers for another meal and completely full that I didn't even want to think about food for the rest of the night.  So, I would recommend this place, but only if you are ready to enjoy a really nice, old fashioned meal with someone special.",Morton’s The Steakhouse,6152594558,104 reviews,2008-05-21,"Nashville, TN",/biz/mortons-the-steakhouse-nashville,5.0,98,"Nashville, TN",Lauren A.

The Salmon and trout are wonderful .And the parm chicken is to die for. and the side salads are very good a few made in house dressings are greatThe key lime pie is a great way to end it some of the best I have ever had.,LongHorn Steakhouse,6153610457,58 reviews,2012-06-10,"Nashville, TN",/biz/longhorn-steakhouse-nashville-2,5.0,17,"Nashville, TN",shaun p.

It helps that it's only a block from my office and therefore perfect for weekday lunches, but then again they're only open for weekday lunches, so I guess it's kismet. The managers/owners have been very supportive and clear about letting me know the beans, rice, and guac are all vegan, so this is an ideal place for a vegan-friendly burrito, bowl, or salad. And speaking of salads, that's what I eat when I'm eating raw, and there are plenty of veggies to add (along with guacamole, of course!) to make it a substantial meal. Their guacamole, by the way, is different from most others in town: it's heavy on cilantro and lime, I think, and that gives it a really refreshing flavor. I'm a fan, but if you don't like cilantro and lime all that much... well, what are you doing eating at a Mexican place anyway?My only complaint is that I wish they were open for dinner and on the weekends, since I sometimes work late enough to want to grab dinner nearby, and I live near enough that this would be a great weekend option.",The Chile Burrito,6152480025,30 reviews,2012-01-04,"Nashville, TN",/biz/the-chile-burrito-nashville,4.0,20,"Nashville, TN",Kate O.

And, unlike the fish tacos of the West, they are made with catfish here. Ha, go figure. Darn I missed an opportunity. I had the burrito bowl with beef brisket. I know - beef brisket in a Mexican bowl - well, its not Mexico after all. As much as I love brisket, this must have been smoked and cook in the same oven as pork. My gut feeling (for real, a tummy rumbler) says so. See, I don't eat pork (health reasons), so, I can tell when something is a little porky (like fishy but pork, ah nevermind). And, it taskted more salty than usual.They give you a ton of toppings to choose from. Think Chipotle but with a mid-southern REAL Mexican twist.

I perused the menu till I stumbled upon the Carnitas and I love Carnitas also Carne Adovada when I can get it. They were done very well with just the right amount of spices and very tender and served with some perfectly done corn tortillas, the dish was succulent and the sides of refried beans and rice were perfect which isn't hard to do but I've been to many ""Mexican"" joints that just can't do rice and beans right. Served with Lettuce, tomatoes  and big dollop of real tasty Guacamole for a truly memorable dinner.

"519 Donelson PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"I am from Southern California and I used to live in Mexico. When I came to Nashville for the first time, the last thing I expected the concierge at my hotel to ask me was whether I liked Mexican food. She sent me to a place called Jalisco's, where the last thing I expected to find was real Mexican food being served by real Mexicans.I ordered the al pastor tacos Jalisco style. When they came out I requested some salsa verde to go with my tacos. The salsa I got was not verde, but it was definitely delish. It was spicy but not too hot, and the taste of the chiles came through perfectamente. The pork was super tender and reminded me of Los Angeles and Tijuana, just the way I like it.The only thing that could have been better was the tortillas. They were a bit dry, but I imagine good tortillas are hard to come by in Nashville.  If they had been made in-house, Jalisco's would have scored five stars from me, easy. I would say this place is doing a bang-up job of bringing a true ethnic flavor to a place that isn't fortunate enough to see a lot of ethnic diversity.A big shout out to the waiter from Jalisco, Mexico for holding steady in a town that is probably not always proud to have him. ¡Viva la raza, compa! ¡Que le vaya bien!",Jalisco Mexican Restaurant,6158855788,113 reviews,2011-10-24,"Long Beach, CA",/biz/jalisco-mexican-restaurant-nashville,4.0,50,"Nashville, TN",Jane L.
"519 Donelson PikeNashville, TN 37214",3.0,"I gave this 5 stars to offset some of the low ratings by some people. I really don't understand all the negativity. Is it a perfect Mexican restaurant? No. However, it is one of the better ones in Nashville. I would give it probably slightly over 4 stars. 1. Every time I go, the service is always excellent.2. Fresh salsa with actual cilantro, onions, and peppers. (you would think this would be standard at a Mexican restaurant, but in Nashville this is not so. Most of the time you get tomato sauce with spice thrown in). 3. Excellent prices in general, but it should be noted that there are food and drink specials every day of the week....not too shabby!Am I some kind of food expert? Not really, but I used to live in the southwest US (where there are WAY more quality Mexican restaurants), and I think that this restaurant would do pretty decently stacked up against restaurants from out there. If this restaurant was located in the Southwest, then I would probably give it 3 stars. Since this is Nashville and good Mexican restaurants(with decent prices) are few and far between, then I still stand by my original rating of slightly over 4 stars.

Either way very enjoyable quick and easy!We will be back!",Bruegger’s Bagels,6153537888,18 reviews,2015-05-07,"Hermitage, TN",/biz/brueggers-bagels-nashville-6,5.0,15,"Nashville, TN",Cathryn D.
"21 White Bridge RoadNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"This was Noel's first trip to Bruegger's to try their bagels. I usually eat at the one near Vanderbilt. We were on our way to Nashville West to shop so we decided to stop and get some BREAKFAST..and I am glad we did...The interior was clean and airy. I liked the feel of the interior. We were greeted immediately and we placed our order. I got an Everything Bagel with plain cream cheese toasted and Noel went with the new Chorizo Jack Bagel and then we both got Italian Sodas for our drinks, I went with regular orange and she went with Blood Orange..they were both very good!!! We would definitely eat here again!!! The cost was $12.53 and left the change out of $15 as a tip in the jar on the counter top...Definitely great breakfast!!!

They are friendly and quick when serving up orders. The bagels are also delicious!",Bruegger’s Bagels,6153537888,195 reviews,2015-06-28,"Nashville, TN",/biz/brueggers-bagels-nashville-6,5.0,15,"Nashville, TN",Jessica S.
"21 White Bridge RoadNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"Bruegger's gets 5 stars from me! Their cream cheese section alone is amazing. If I was purchasing cream cheese for like a party or big breakfast, I would get it from here.Never once have they messed up my order and the service is quick! I love the egg and cheese on the Asiago bagel with the jalapeño cream cheese. CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE! This place is perfect to grab breakfast on your way to work or whatever. But it's also good enough that I would sit down with someone and just enjoy.

"21 White Bridge RoadNashville, TN 37205",4.0,Love our bagel place. Faster than downtown one. Service is awesome and they are helpful for locals they know their interests.

"21 White Bridge RoadNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"I've liked this place ever since I was a kid. There's also a location nearby, by the Harding/HWY 100 split. You can't go wrong with the bacon, egg, and cheese bagel, but lately I've been loving that promotional bagel with the Canadian bacon on it. The sun dried tomato bagel is to die for. This is my favorite place to go for breakfast :)",Bruegger’s Bagels,6153537888,42 reviews,2015-02-24,"Nashville, TN",/biz/brueggers-bagels-nashville-6,5.0,15,"Nashville, TN",Allison B.

"21 White Bridge RoadNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"Good bagels!  plus a very friendly staff who were chipper considering it was only 6 am when i got there. I got a boring bagel so I won't report on that.  It was nice of them to give me a full size cup for my water, and I ended up staying around doing work (they have that free WiFi hook up) for hours.  Also,  an incredibly clean bathroom.  All in all a great experience,  considering it's a chain.",Bruegger’s Bagels,6153537888,18 reviews,2014-09-01,"Nashville, TN",/biz/brueggers-bagels-nashville-6,5.0,15,"Nashville, TN",Anna B.
"21 White Bridge RoadNashville, TN 37205",4.0,I love brueggers but this location has the WORST service. I always try to run in around 2 before school and even though they don't close till 3 I am rushed out and barely given a chance to tell them my whole order. The new girl has made my sandwich wrong Everytime and instead of adding cheese on my sandwich she just put on top of the already wrapped up sandwich and put it in the bag. I have never been given a chance at check out to add chips or a drink I have to ask after they already are grabbing for my card. Also one time I've walked in around 230 and they already had turned the soups off and told me I can MICROWAVE it at home if I want it.... That's the most ridiculous shit I've ever heard of!!!,Bruegger’s Bagels,6153537888,5 reviews,2015-02-03,"Nashville, TN",/biz/brueggers-bagels-nashville-6,2.0,15,"Nashville, TN",Ashley H.
"21 White Bridge RoadNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"What's not to love about bagels and coffee? I think one of my favorite breakfasts would have to be a nice hot cup of coffee and a toasted bagel & smear. Preferably veggie smear when I'm at Bruegger's.Service here is always friendly and quick. My girlfriend and I stopped in yesterday morning for a quick breakfast and to our surprise it was free coffee day! Free give outs are awesome, but when its free coffee at 7AM, its even more awesome. They even gave us a coupon for free coffee the next time we are in.Since it fall it's necessary for every establish to pack their shelves with anything and everything pumpkin. The Pumpkin Spice Coffee here is not to be missed. They also have pumpkin cream cheese, which I will for sure try next time I'm there.",Bruegger’s Bagels,6153537888,336 reviews,2011-11-10,"Nashville, TN",/biz/brueggers-bagels-nashville-6,3.0,15,"Nashville, TN",Justin R.
"21 White Bridge RoadNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"Never go to this location if you are in a big hurry.  The staff doesn't have very much pep in their step :/  This has been my experience the last 4 or 5 times, but they still make a decent bagel.",Bruegger’s Bagels,6153537888,13 reviews,2013-08-30,"Nashville, TN",/biz/brueggers-bagels-nashville-6,3.0,15,"Nashville, TN",Elise G.
"21 White Bridge RoadNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"Gosh darn you Bruegger's Bagel. You hit the spot! Having one of those morning's recently where that super healthy breakfast just wouldn't get me through my day, I accidentally came across this location. Although, bagels by nature, aren't really unhealthy; you must stop by here and try one of their delicious bagels topped with cheese. I was very surprised that when I let one foot hit the floor that the woman behind the counter enthusiastically greeted me. That was a nice start to the morning! Customer service here is equally as amazing as is the quality of the food. They have a bunch of different cream cheeses that you can match to your bagel. The variety and freshness of the bagels is at rockstar status. Although not near where I live...I will be sure to make this a stop on my way anywhere near the shop.",Bruegger’s Bagels,6153537888,205 reviews,2011-07-28,"Nashville, TN",/biz/brueggers-bagels-nashville-6,5.0,15,"Nashville, TN",Jamie D.
"21 White Bridge RoadNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"This place is as middle of the road as one can get  - generic bagels with generic spreads, pretty good coffee and decent sandwiches. In fact Bruegger's would scream 'ok' except that would be out of character, so it would just probably say it in a medium voice so as not to offend.",Bruegger’s Bagels,6153537888,147 reviews,2012-11-13,"Hendersonville, TN",/biz/brueggers-bagels-nashville-6,3.0,15,"Nashville, TN",Stuart W.
"21 White Bridge RoadNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"Solid, if unoriginal bagel cafe.  They have a decent selection of bagel varieties, as well as cream cheese offerings.  Some of their sandwiches are a little uninspired, but the staff does their best, and definitely adds to the experience.I do wish that Brueggers would toast their bagels just a little bit longer.  Rather than having a nice crunch to them, they can be a little chewy.",Bruegger’s Bagels,6153537888,49 reviews,2011-02-02,"Nashville, TN",/biz/brueggers-bagels-nashville-6,4.0,15,"Nashville, TN",Josh B.
"21 White Bridge RoadNashville, TN 37205",4.0,"Baked fresh daily with no preservatives, Bruegger's Bagels are good. Honey grain, pumpernickel, blueberry and asiago parmesan bagels plain or in a sandwich are my top choices. Garlic cream cheese with roasted peppers, tomateo, lettuce and red onion make their Leonardo da Veggie sandwich my favorite animal friendly choice. Wheat bread, wrap or bagelwich with over a dozen topping choices means there are hundreds of possible sandwich combinations. But Bruegger's bagels boil down, for me, to good bagel baking.",Bruegger’s Bagels,6153537888,260 reviews,2010-11-19,"Nashville, TN",/biz/brueggers-bagels-nashville-6,4.0,15,"Nashville, TN",Tart L.
