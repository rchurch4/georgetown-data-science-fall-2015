"209 10th Ave S Ste 221Nashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Within the context of what Morning Glory is, I think it's a fine place.  But make sure you understand what it is:  It is a convenience store/deli inside Cummins Station, intended for people who work in Cummins Stations.  If you travel to Cummins Station specifically to dine at Morning Glory, you're gonna have a bad time.Having said that, as somebody who works in Cummins Station, I like Morning Glory quite a bit.  The staff are nice, they have a decent variety of lunch food, and their prices are surprisingly low, considering how much they must be paying to rent that space.It appears to be run by a Korean family and, as others have said, the English is not strong.  But it's serviceable.   They have a credit card minimum, but it's manageable.The quality of the food itself is fine, again taking the context into consideration.  This is a nice alternative to other places in the building:  Cinco de Mayo (fine, but you can't eat Mexican every day), M Restaurant (so expensive I have never been there), M Market (my, they take themselves seriously -- and quite expensive), the Suchi place (which has a nice buffet actually, but is also kind of pricey).Both Cinco de Mayo and Morning Glory win the price award in Cummins Station.As far as seating, they have a counter inside that is servicable but not terribly comfortable.   They have tables and chairs out in the hall, but in the winter that entrance is a bit drafty.  But they serve everything in to-go boxes, so you can certainly take it back to the office.",Morning Glory Deli,6152565657,1 review,2015-01-26,"Murfreesboro, TN",/biz/morning-glory-deli-nashville,4.0,4,"Nashville, TN",John I.

"2817 Clarksville PikeNashville, TN 37208",3.0,"I'm always on the hunt for delicious BBQ so when the coworkers suggested Nick's for lunch I forgot all about my Lean Cuisine and told them HELL  YEAH I'm IN!  I really had no idea what to expect when we pulled in.  The place is right at Clarksville Hwy and Rosa Parks just down the road from MetroCenter.  When you walk in there are three windows - one to order, one to stare at the food you are going to get, and one to pick up your food.  Menus are available to look at on the counter and also on the wall.  A room of tables is off to your right - it isn't very many tables but it definitely wasn't packed when we were there so perhaps not a problem?I always get pulled pork since it is my favorite BBQ.  Instead of getting the sandwich, I had to get the pulled pork plate because of the great sounding sides they had.  What sides you ask?  Creamed corn, green beans, turnip greens, mac and cheese, white beans (eww!), apples, mashed potatoes, and others I'm probably leaving out.  OMG what's up with all the sides?  I love it!  I got the creamed corn and the turnip greens.  They also have a three side plate as well as a veggie plate option.  Then you choose regular bread or cornbread.  And a drink - Pepsi products only.  Is Pepsi ok?  To quote some comedian whose name I cannot remember: is Monopoly money ok?  Ugh, they also give you a can with a cup of ice.  I didn't ask if there were refills but you usually don't get them when they serve the can.  Booo!  They put the food on your plate and pass it through the window at the end - kind of like passing it through a jail cell?  Not that I would know.  Ahem.  The first thing I noticed was WOW this is a lot of meat! (TWSS!)  Pork had a good smoky flavor.  Their hot sauce was also really good - definitely trumps Neely's.  The turnip greens came with a little plastic container of vinegar to dump on them if you want...and really, why wouldn't you want?  I thought the turnip greens were almost like home which means delicious!  The creamed corn was lacking something - I think I was expecting the corn to be sweet corn and it was more white corn.  But still pretty solid.  And remember I said - these are very large portions.  I couldn't finish it all and I was stuffed to the max.  So much for productiveness the rest of the day!Overall, I think Nick's is the clear winner of the BBQ options in the MetroCenter area.  I'll be the Duchess in no time!!",Nick’s Famous Barbecue,6152486365,1027 reviews,2010-11-19,"Nashville, TN",/biz/nicks-famous-barbecue-nashville,4.0,3,"Nashville, TN",Nickie G.

"Vanderbilt Medical CenterNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"So this was my second time venturing to Au Bon Pain and it was yet another pleasant experience! The Good: Lets just start off by saying I like to try new things food wise, but not to kin on foods I can't pronounce so I mostly study what ingredients come in it. Don't ask me what I tried my first visit cause I can't remember but this time I tried the Thai Chicken Peanut Wrap and MANNN IT WAS GOOD AS HELL! Came with chicken, lettuce, peanut oil, cucumbers, wontons, and some type of shredded cheese...of course I was skeptical but just like the first time I went the young lady behind the counter making you food was so polite, and very helpful that she unintentionally talked me into to trying it,....Thanks kind lady cause I would have missed out on an AMAZING EXPERIENCE! all the ingrediants in my wrap tasted so fresh and everything blended together so well when i took my first bite  all lingering doubt abandoned my mind and even though that wrap was a pretty big size I devoured it under 5 mins!! Ok enough about the food,..sorry had a fat moment :(  I've read some reviews that complain about the prices, Now think about it...you pay about $5 to $6 and some change for a greasy burger with fries that may have been sitting under a heat lamp for God knows how long! When you can get your food made in front of you with FRESH produce that's very HEALTHY  and pay maybe a smidget more...?!?!? I'm sorry im not feeling you sonnn! As for the atomosphere, it seems to be very clean and for the times i walked in there i tend to be always greeted so great customer service from the counter to the outstanding kool chick making my food!The Bad: Only bad thing to me is that there aren't more chains of this establishment everywhere in nashville but you know what they say ""Too much of a Good thing is Bad""..that might apply to something else so don't quote me on that!..lol I am a fan and will be back Again and Again and Again!....",Au Bon Pain,,234 reviews,2013-08-29,"Nashville, TN",/biz/au-bon-pain-nashville,5.0,29,"Nashville, TN",Da Deacon H.

It's not a place that I would seek out but it is conveniently located in Vanderbilt so when you have long appointments it's there for you. This is definitely a better choice then McDonald's.

I bought a blueberry muffin and was extremely disappointed in the fact that the top was coated in hard sugar crystals. Customer service is so-so. The manager who took our order was helpful and pleasant while the girl that gave us our food...not so much.

"Vanderbilt Medical CenterNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"As Megan C. rightly pointed out, its unfair to judge Au Bon Pain on the political struggle surrounding the departure of the much beloved McDonald's.The Better Half was recently ""enjoying"" a brief stay at VUH so I got to stop in a few times.The things it definitely has going for it is the ""ready to go"" meals.  In the Vandy environment, if you are a patient, a visitor or an employee you want to be in and out as fast as you possibly can.  There is a plethora of  these items waiting of you.Everything I had was reasonably fresh and definitely warm.  I felt the price was fairly decent, and I spent almost no time in line any of the times that I went there.There is however a ""Made to order"" sandwich line in the back. I did not take advantage of this in any of my visits so I cannot speak to how good or quickly they deliver, or how the prices of those sandwiches are.If you are in VUH, it's the fastest meal you can get, otherwise you have to truck over to Children's for the food court there.

"Vanderbilt Medical CenterNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"The infamously greasy McDonald's attached to the Vanderbilt hospital has officially been replaced via French invasion, named Au Bon Pain.  While I will not argue that ABP is a much more healthy alternative to Mickey D's, the notion that it is in the same price range as McD's is absolutely ridiculous.  ABP's price range is comparable to Panera or Bread & Company and offers a similar range of food items. The renovation is beautiful.  Colorful couches, large glass windows, and brightly painted walls make ABP a fun and relaxing space to grab a bite to eat, study, or hold a meeting.  In fact, there's even a small private meeting room to the right of the main entrance for maybe a business lunch or mini-party.I am familiar with the Au Bon Pains that can be found everywhere in Boston, so I was excited when I heard they were opening a branch in Nashville.  It has sort of a cafeteria style in that you grab what you want and then bring it to one of the checkout registers. I have yet to try the sandwiches, but they look delicious and will definitely be back to try them. They also offer soup, a salad bar, and an assortment of baked goods.  I stopped in today for an afternoon coffee and snack.  Unlike its similar competitors like Panera, ABP actually brews a decent cup of Joe!  The hazelnut blend is wonderfully aromatic and delicious.  And, I love love how they offer SOY MILK at no extra cost to accompany your coffee, for those of us that are lacking the lactase enzyme.  I paired my coffee with a delicious cinnamon scone (after staring at the baked goods options for a good 10 minutes, thereby blocking the normal flow of people traffic, since they all looked oh-so-scrumptious and it was so hard to decide).They're still working out some of the kinks, since they just opened Tuesday.  But, give them some time, and this place is going to be a hit!  Also, GREAT hours. Currently, they are open 5 AM - midnight on weekdays and 6 AM - 11 PM on weekends.  But, I heard they are hoping to upgrade to 24/7-hour service eventually.  Vandy students are going to overrun this place, for sure.",Au Bon Pain,,311 reviews,2011-06-22,"San Francisco, CA",/biz/au-bon-pain-nashville,4.0,29,"Nashville, TN",Jess Y.

"Vanderbilt Medical CenterNashville, TN 37212",3.0,"I hate this place. I work at Vanderbilt, so have had the opportunity to go here a few times -- and am very disappointed. The McDonald's they had before, though greasy and unhealthy, was perhaps the MOST efficient McDonald's, nay restaurant, I'd ever been to.  This sort of efficiency is necessary at a place like Vanderbilt's Medical Center, where lunch is always swamped with visitors, doctors, and medical students. Plus, McDonald's was inexpensive, which is nice if you're a poor employee, student, or visitor. Au Bon Pain is probably twice as expensive!  Also, they shut down the salad and soup bars several hours before they close, which limits the amount of food available later in the evening.  What's the point of being open until midnight if there's nothing to eat??  So, in list form, here are my gripes about Au Bon Pain:1. Too expensive for anything large enough to be filling2. Service takes too long -- wait is often 20-30 minutes for a sandwich3. Place is not patient-friendly -- mostly filled with doctors and students at lunch.  Don't know if this is the price, or what.4. Amount of food they have available diminishes rapidly after about 8 or 9 pm.  They stop serving new soup, take down salad bar, etc.  At McDonald's, you could get anything on the menu up until they closed!!5.

"73 White Bridge RoadNashville, TN 37205",3.5,"Weak and starving after a never ending, brutal morning of work reports and conference calls at the office, I was finally able to dash down to my car and drive down the road for a quick bite to eat at Jersey Mike's. As I walked up to the front door, my stomach growled in eager anticipation. I happily strolled up to the counter, savoring the sweet aroma of deli sandwich meats and cheeses. My happy moment was quickly quashed, however, by the glare of the sandwich girl over the top of the glass separation. ""What do you want on this?"" She asked in a flat, annoyed voice with dull, angry eyes as she indicated my sandwich. I was taken aback--what had I done to this young employee to warrant such a deprecating tone from her?! As I sought to overcome my feels of surprise, she repeated her question, all the more forcefully and--dare I say--vehemently. I stumbled over my words as I attempted to quickly answer her before she got angrier. As she threw my veggies and sauces onto my sandwich, I snuck furtive glances at her expression, still trying to gauge her mood towards me and figure out what I had done wrong, besides perhaps dressing the wrong way. ""Is that all?"" The angry, annoyed eyes looked at me again, almost as if they were daring me to even try ask for one more topping on my sandwich...she was clearly finished and ready to move on to the next customer. ""Oh, uh, no! That's all!!"" She deftly wrapped up my sandwich, stuffed it in a bag, and tossed it across the counter towards me where it landed with a dull thud. She then turned towards her coworker and began chit-chatting in a surprisingly normal, happy voice. I took this as my signal to 'scram,' and after paying, hightailed it out of there with my tail between my legs. Needless to say, I won't be returning to Jersey Mike's anytime in the near future unless I feel in the mood to be publicly shamed.  It really is true what they say....it only takes one bad experience to ruin your reputation with someone!

I normally scoff at chains, and this is definitely a chain, but they do make a pretty great sandwich for a very reasonable price. My wife had a hot chicken cheesesteak that she thought was excellent - the chicken actually tasted fresh griddled, not microwaved from a package like Subway's atrocity. My Original Italian sub was a masterpiece, with five types of meat, a very juicy tomato, and a tasty oil and vinegar combo, it was one of the best Italian style subs I've had not served by actual Italians. The location is clean, the staff friendly if not exactly gregarious, several TVs keep the noise level pretty high (an advantage for us, with an infant who likes the bustle), and had no problem with my wife breast-feeding under a nursing cover after we ate.

"2800 Opryland DrNashville, TN 37214",2.5,"I give Paisano's two stars because you get what you expect from the place. There's nothing terrible about it, but you have to go into the meal knowing that you are selecting one of the lower-end dining options at the Opryland Hotel. The pizza is greasy, expensive and isn't offered in a ton of varieties. The salads are pre-made in plastic containers like at the airport, and the breadsticks are just not worth the calories. I will say that the place offers wine, but I did not partake as I was ""dining on a dime"" that night.But, that being said, the staff members there were extremely friendly and the line moved fairly quickly. You pass through a line, select what you want, and pay at the cash register. Then, it's off to hunt down your own seating in/around the Delta Island or take the food back to your room.Overall, Paisano's is the place to go when staying at Opryland and you have a meal that you'd like to ""get over with"" and not spend a fortune on.

The hot sauce, which I'm pretty sure is just Frank's Red Hot, adds a lot too. As for their other offerings, the chicken is not that great, nor is the spinach pie. The hummus is tasty, but they only provide four squares of pita with it so you end up with a very off ratio of hummus to pita.

I have to be honest and say the hummus was nearly inedible. I am not sure what they did to it? Possibly watered it down to stretch it? It was very, very thin and had a gritty taste to it, every disappointing. They serve ranch dressing, I missed the cucumber option at other Chicago Style Gyro spots. The falafel were seasoned well (although not better than the location on Gallatin Pike) and deep fried crispy on the outside and soft in the middle.

I'll rate them from least favorite to favorite...The hot flavor tasted good, but they were a little soggy.  In my opinion, breaded and fried wings don't typically work well when they are sauced.  Didn't taste bad, and not too hot, but just too wet.The cajun wings had a nice crunch and a little kick.  It was basically like fried chicken wings dusted with a pre-packaged cajun seasoning that you can buy off the shelf at any supermarket.  Overall, pretty good.The country style wings were by far my favorite. They were essentially a delicious, miniature version of southern fried chicken.  No sauce, no seasonings out of the ordinary, pretty straightforward. The sweat tea took me a bit by surprise.  Less like sweet tea, more like an overly sweetened Arnold Palmer.Service was prompt, friendly, and accommodating.  They typically only allow two flavors of wing in one combo, but they made an exception and allowed me to get 3 flavors.Overall, not bad change of pace from my run of the mill lunch spots.",Knockout Wings,,68 reviews,2014-11-25,"Nashville, TN",/biz/knockout-wings-nashville,3.0,8,"Nashville, TN",Jason B.

The mild sauce was good. The Cajun was a dry rub sprinkled over fried wings which was fine, it just wasn't that flavorful. All in all the wings were mediocre at best and it just didn't live up to what everybody has said. Now the honey biscuits.... They need to sell those joints by the dozen I'd by 2.

It's airy, bright, has fantastic light, and (in theory) plenty of seating.* But, there's an uneasy coolness to this location. Granted, as discussed by other reviewers, the workers aren't the friendliest (I don't find them to be mean more... uninterested; not chatty) but it's more than that. The vibe is just... a bit off. The elements are there for something good but it doesn't click.That said, the grub is enjoyable. When I walked through the door, I hadn't yet eaten and was quite hungry. I ordered a sandwich, drink a dessert: a proper lunch. I kept wanting to like my sandwich more than I did. I ordered the John Day (? I think that was the name): turkey, banana pepper, dijon mustard, and cheddar cheese. It didn't look too exciting and tasted about the same. I kept thinking that it was missing an ingredient or two. Plus, the sad, limp sandwich I received didn't inspire much excitement. My drink and dessert choices proved to be better. To guzzle, I opted for the Winona Cyder. First off, I tend to gravitate toward seasonal beverages. Secondly, I love cider. Third, the name is pure genius. As a quick aside: Winona, girl, we believe in you. Everybody knows your descent into crap is a direct result of getting done wrong by -- and stolen from -- the real enemy: The Goop.

However, I'm a mellow and easy going girl who smiles, says ""hello"" and ""thank you.""During my first visit, the barista got my drink order wrong and I was almost afraid to tell him that it wasn't what I asked for. Not really approachable, to say the least. My visit today was no better.

It was Earl Grey tea with steamed milk, vanilla and a shot of espresso. It ended up being $5, which seemed very steep. My drink was already in process by the time they rang me up. No big deal. Expensive drink, but it was very good.Go back the next day. Order the same thing, same size, prepared to pay $5. It was now $6. Again, I was rung up long after the drink was started. I asked the guy if he was sure, as I'd paid a different price yesterday. He explained the large is $5.50 plus tax (I got large the last time too), and was just not very nice about it. Whatever. I paid $6, added $1 tip, and the drink was barely warm enough (and I don't even like my drinks too warm). If you're going to sell something that's overpriced, at least list the price on the menu.

"1921 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.0,"Portland Brew reminds me of home. Home being Southern California, some may argue this place favors Oregon (Portland...) or Northern CA but since I've never been to either I am sticking with my comparison. It is very comfortable here. There is nothing pretentious or ""too cool"" about this place. The decor is laid back, artsy and welcoming. I feel like I could sit and stay a while. Ironically I never do as I am typically grabbing a coffee to head some where else fabulous like the grocery store. That laid back feeling is what reminds me of So Cal, at least the low key areas where you can sort of sit and enjoy music, maybe chat with a few friends and enjoy a really good cup of coffee. I am always excited to hear what's playing, recently it has been The Cure - one of my top five = instant points. The staff is friendly and welcoming, very social. Never a frown to be seen. My medium coffee sets me back $2.19 plus tip, excellent price for great coffee. There is an assortment of fun little figurines at the cash register, my Daughter and I make a habit of organizing them and setting them up each time we come in. No point to that tidbit just sayin. So, if you can grab a parking spot in front of the place or even better walk here, by all means do. It will be worth your trip.

"1921 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.0,"Its so sad to write this review. I used to love Portland Brew. Its quiet, and its close to my house for a quick afternoon cup of coffee. It was a typical meeting place for my friends and I to hang out. But now I know I'll never be back. Last Friday I went to enjoy some coffee with a friend. My receipt printed and I signed the $4.32 total and added a $1.00 tip. Then, on Tuesday my card is declined at the gas station. I checked my bank account and it was negative because Portland Brew charged me over $10,000 for a cup of coffee. It was a random amount, not even close to the number my total came out to be. I called the store and tried three different numbers, but none of them were answered after quite a few tries. I had to leave work and drive down to the store. Management was very nonchalant about the matter. Saying ""oh we're sorry about that."" Don't I atleast deserve ""Oh..we are VERY sorry about that.""? They acted like it was no big deal to them. I'm a poor college student unfortunately, so having all of my checks that I wrote for bills bounce was slightly stressful. So long to my perfect credit with all of the utility companies. :(Luckily my boss LOVES dealing with legal matters and is handling the situation. I'm awful with confrontation and just want all my money back (including my numerous returned check fees). Now I have no cash for a few days until it gets resolved. boo.I understand people make mistakes, but when they make big ones, they should be much more apologetic and quick to fix the problem.****UPDATE****The owner was extremely apologetic and has a much better attitude than the manager.

"1921 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.0,"As far as hipster coffee bars go this one is pretty good.  Although as I read these other reviews on the side I am wondering if I had a once in a lifetime experience with this place.  Prices are average for buying a cup of coffee, and you can get a free refill.  Now, I only really drink just plain coffee.  I did not order anything special, the guy behind the counter just handed me a cup and I filled it then poured some half and half in.  Although the person I was with ordered a latte, and I did not hear him complain about it, so it must have been good, or at least passable.  Though I think if it were just passable, he would have complained.What makes this place cool is the awesome layout of the space.  It has a second floor that is partially open to the main level below, and it has a ton of seating.  Old cushiony chairs, coffee tables (ok that sounds pretty dumb in a review about a coffee place, but I didn't name the type of table) and just a bunch of regular tables and chairs.  They also have a handful of games to play. We played chess, and by no fault of Portland Brew, I got beat pretty badly, and then a trivia game of some sort.  I like this, I think all coffee joints should have a smattering of games lying around for me to use to waste my time.  It will certainly keep me there longer, and maybe even encourage me to come back.There were a lot of people hanging out with laptops doing work.  Some people just in for a cup of coffee and a bit of conversation.  It did seem that most people once they got upstairs stayed for a while.  Also, this place has great natural light with the large windows, so it is a pretty good environment for being indoors without feeling like you are in a cave.I think in the end we were here for over an hour, but I wasn't timing it.  The place never got super busy, it was never too loud, all in all a pleasant environment to just spend a lazy Sunday afternoon in.If I lived in Nashville I would probably go back.",Portland Brew East,6157322119,58 reviews,2011-03-05,"Saint Louis, MO",/biz/portland-brew-east-nashville,4.0,57,"Nashville, TN",Kimberly N.

East I seem to run into a character like this.  They put local art on the walls and there's an extremely cool loft for introspective coffee house types.  The location is pretty good, and there are a couple of tables outside for the occasional sunny day.  As I've said, it may not be the best coffee in the city (oh, and the pastries are pretty limited), but I like it.  I put it ahead of Bongo Java but behind Sip.",Portland Brew East,6157322119,349 reviews,2008-04-15,"Nashville, TN",/biz/portland-brew-east-nashville,4.0,57,"Nashville, TN",Patrick R.
"1921 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.0,"Portland Brew East is one of those places that I really, really, want to love and be able to tell everyone how awesome it is...but, alas...they make it kind of difficult. So the good stuff:The space itself is pretty cool. It's big, there are a TON of tables and outlets so you pretty much always know you are going to get a spot and place to plug in your laptop. I almost always go to the loft upstairs, which is big and open and airy with lots of light. I like that they've got floor lamps hanging around in case you need more light over your table/book and that they've mixed up wing back chairs with regular chairs. Depending on what I'm doing (reading vs. computer work) I like to sit in a different kind of chair. Portland Brew lets me do that.The coffee is fine. Not blow your mind amazing and not bad coffee either. Just good solid coffee. The food is actually pretty good. I've had scrambled eggs plate that had heaps of onions and jalapenos and cheese in it that was pretty good and their turkey pesto panini sandwhich is also damn good. Chocolate cookies are flat and chewy, which is how I like them so I also think those are pretty good.The other thing I like about Portland Brew is that it tends to be decently quiet. Whenever I go most people there seem to be studying/working/reading. I don't see lots of kids running around and it doesn't seem to be a place where people come to socialize. It isn't a see and be seen coffee dating pool like lots of other coffee shops. If you like a bit of quiet while you read or work then you'd probably like it too.The not so great stuff:The employees. To be honest, they just kind of suck. I am not sure what is going through this owner/manager's head when they hire people but someone needs to send them to like, customer service training camp or something. It seems as if Portland Brew hires people to project a certain image (hipster, I'm too cool to be chipper and provide you with good service). I get it. However I think I can speak for most consumers when I say that if I have to choose between a server who wears cool shoes and one who actually provides good customer service, I'll go with the latter. I'm not bothered by food service workers wearing undershirts to work...but  when employees regularly act put out when I walk in the door and make them do their job it's a little annoying. The other thing that's a problem at this place is that they run out of supplies way too frequently. I would say at least half the time I go in there they are out of something. Now, I spent a lot of time working in food service and sometimes you are going to run out of things....it happens. But when you are a coffee shop and you regularly run out of basic items like chocolate syrup or soy milk....well, your ordering system needs revamping. It's kind of just poor business skills. If you're a coffee shop and you run out of chocolate syrup you can't make half your drinks....",Portland Brew East,6157322119,13 reviews,2011-06-15,"Nashville, TN",/biz/portland-brew-east-nashville,3.0,57,"Nashville, TN",L S.

"1921 Eastland AveNashville, TN 37206",3.0,"It was an establishment of no small stature, the coffee shop that had for some time threatened to wrest the hands of the Bongo Java Roasting Company from about Nashville's underdeveloped little neck.  This building was of course not the first of its kind.  There was that one just off of West End, and then the one in 12 South, the one that had started it all by finally holding up its coffee condoms and its white paper cups in triumphant defiance of the norm.  But this one, it was in EAST Nashville, just down the road from their humble apartment.  Yes, this one belonged to them.They both needed coffee that night.  After all, she had never seen Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and he was determined to get through the first season that day so that they could move on to the meatier stuff.  The only thing they were missing for their Buffython was some coffee to help hold off the slumber.  Unfortunately for the young couple, their coffee maker was for some reason brewing coffee that tasted as though it had been percolated in a garbage can.  Have no fear though, for the Portland Brew is right down the road.  So for a moment Buffy and her intrepid gang were left behind for the sweet lure of the bean.They arrived and opened the door they had opened so many times before, only this time something was dreadfully wrong.  U2 was playing over the shop's sound system.  And not even early U2, those albums wrought with political tension, that some part of you hates to admit are at least passable as early 80s post punk.  No, this was the U2 that had unfortunately survived the 90s and emerged as a testament to one man's ego and one band's mediocrity.Standing behind the bar listening to Bono belt it out was a youth of the shaggy blond hair variety.  The kind of kid who bought every Beatles and Hendrix shirt he could find at Target.  He stood with his back turned, perhaps asleep, perhaps just so moved by Ireland's favored son (...) that he could not wrest himself from his home against the counter.  The young couple exchanged silent glances with one another, trying to figure out what the deal was.  Neither of them knew.  He knocked on the counter top, but there was still no response.  Maybe the young man was narcoleptic?  Just when they thought they might scream, literally, as it seemed the only method with which to rouse this young man, another soul came around the corner, cast a glance at his cherubic friend, and then mercifully turned down the U2.He arrived at the register, fielded their orders, and then went to work.  The man filled his coffee cup with some half and half and a dark roast which was utterly forgettable while the barista, apparently dressed for the nines in his fake motorcycle rider boots, black jeans, denim communist revolutionary hat, and yes, a Black Rebel Motorcycle Club t-shirt, prepared the lady's drink.  I believe it was some sort of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club outfit, and neither the boy nor girl were certain if he had put it together himself or simply bought it prepackaged.  So BRMC fan made her Americano, after again asking her what kind of flavoring she wanted in it, and finally the couple were off.Back in their home, sitting in front of the warm glow of the boy's laptop, huddled closely together after two large cups of coffee and watching Buffy and crew whomp some vampy ass, both of them silently wished that their was a chosen one out there to fight the forces of mediocre coffee.",Portland Brew East,6157322119,46 reviews,2007-08-28,"Nashville, TN",/biz/portland-brew-east-nashville,2.0,57,"Nashville, TN",Brett W.

"3900 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"3.5It is what it is. Unfortunately, Nashville is not SF. We don't have the depths of certain cuisines found in other cities. In time, we'll get there. In fact, I'm sure there's some small mom & pop joint in the city serving up delectable, addictive fare. It just hasn't been yelped yet. It'll get there. Until then and that said, Chinatown offers up a lot to enjoy -- you just have to know how to order. The restaurant tries to straddle the line between authentic and Americanized and the trouble comes in trying to serve two masters. I understand the latter perspective -- it's located in Green Hills and has been around for a while. Know your audience. It makes sense. The last few years, though, have been transformative to/for Nashville. The Chinese restaurant that capitalizes off the influx of and demand from foodies (hate that word) will win big.And, again, what you get out of Chinatown is directly proportional to what you put in. Back in my Chicago days -- and before I placed a fatwa on him -- I was a huge fan of Tony Hu. Any restaurant/endeavor he opened, I was at. I'd never experienced the focus on Chinese regionality when it came to food and he served it up well. Soup dumplings, spice profiles, meat heavy, fish heavy, etc., there was a method to it all. It makes sense. China's ginormous. 'Chinese food', therefore, is a massive undertaking. So, if you do your research, find out the region(s) Chinatown best represents and the dishes that best represent that region, you're assured to have a slam dunk experience. If you're truly seasoned in Chinese fare, ask for the Chinese menu and go to town.I know all this. But, when I came in on a cold Monday night, I just wanted some Americanized Chinese food to eat with the porter that was chilling in my fridge. I ordered the garlic chicken with white rice and engaged in some chit-chat with the front of the house. She was very nice and the restaurant was packed (good sign). After long enough to make me know that my food was made to order but not so long that I got restless, I paid $10 and was on my way. Was it tasty? Yep. Did it make me weak in the knees?

The fried dough was edible but we wanted chicken not dough.I ordered fried rice with egg and received a bowl of steamed brown rice...I didnt expect to have great fried rice here, but I at least expected a piece of carrot or a few pieces of egg.

Sometimes a shrimp will end up somewhere when a restaurant serves seafood, but these eggs rolls were primarily made up of shrimp...thank goodness I took a bite before my mom did.

I really like this place. We order pretty much the same thing every time we go. Start with the green onion pancakes and crab ragoons. Both are always hot and delicous. They aren't greesy and are served with appropriate (and different) sauces. For mains, we always order off menu general tso's beef, beef belly in hot pot and either sizzling beef or mongolian beef. The beef belly in hot pot is amazing - it comes out already boiling in this beautfiul stew sauce, large beef chucks braised down and tender and served with baby bok choy thats been still holding its form with a bit of crunch but soft and tender - so delish!

"3900 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"Overall, a solid place for Chinese in Green Hills & very convenient if you work nearby.Atmosphere: Clean, pretty quiet, & nicely decorated.Service: Polite, friendly, attentive.Food: Mixed. I've found a few great dishes that are my go-to (Mongolian beef is my favorite!) Some others have been very average (the lo mein is not that great). You get a lot for the price with the lunch specials & their egg flower soup and eggrolls are good.Note: The last time I ordered online, it didn't work. The order went through successfully online, but when I arrived to pick up my food, the worker informed me that their online ordering wasn't working.

"3900 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"It's Nashville, Nashville, Nashville....welcome!Point is - context is key.  I think a lot of the reviewers on here are used to Americanized chinese food (it's what is mainly available here) and therefore graded accordingly.Authentic  chinese food is not drowned in cheap stir-fry sweet/sour/salty sauce - the key lies in its balance of flavors without overwhelming the taste buds.  If one is used to eating salty food, the cuisine here will come across as bland.  So if Panda Express is your staple, I would not recommend this place to you.Chinatown is a mix of both - authentic and americanized.  For the geographic area, they are about as authentic as it gets without scaring the majority of diners away who may or may not have tried authentic chinese food before. Now onto the food - good mix of meat vs. vegetarian dishes, generous portion sizes.So for the Nashville area, it is pretty good.  But graded on my collective experience of Chinese dining - it is A-OK.    Every time the craving hits, this is my go to place.

My son got a fried rice, his usual. He was not impressed. No one ever spoke to us, everything was done with grumpy face and hand gestures. Then it seemed as if they were unsure who would serve us, so that took a while. Our waitress never came back, ever. Despite this I left a 15% tip, and she found out right away because after I filled it out, she picked it up and looked at it. *&#%! Really? Cardinal waitressing sin. That has happened to me one other time, ever. Ironically both times when the waitresses were mediocre at best. I would never ever go back. I would not recommend at all.

I will say the restaurant itself is very well kept and clean and the staff are extremely friendly but the food itself is average. I ordered the Orange Chicken with fried rice and my girlfriend ordered the General Tso's Chicken with Lo Mein. The Lo Mein was very good I must say but the fried rice was on the bland side.

"3900 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",3.5,I've been here lots of times but always ended up eating the food before remembering to take pictures!  Probably because I know how good it is. Went again today and it was the normal experience. Great food. Great service. Was in the mood for a potato dish that I used to eat in China so I asked the server and she spoke to the chef and he made it for me off menu. It's that type of place. If they can do it they will. Also got the chicken and tofu in peppers (can't remember the name in the menu). The sweet pea leafs which is my fav veggie. The scallion pancake and then the mapo tofu. They make my mapo with Sichuan peppercorns which is the only way to eat it as it really spices it up. Ate everything and will be in a food coma for the next day or so but it is really worth it.

"3900 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"In a town where great Chinese food simply does not exist, Chinatown is pretty darn delicious and the closest we've got.We ate here for lunch today after 18 months of living in Nashville.  How it took us so long, we'll never know!  We came after an intense workout and were HUNGRY, so we were able to sample quite a few items on the menu and enjoyed nearly everything we ate.I chose the Mongolian Chicken lunch special, which came with brown rice, egg drop soup and a chicken spring roll.  It was a great deal for less than $7, and while the portion was small, everything that came with my lunch was freshly prepared and piping hot.  The soup was nicely flavored and not too salty, but the Mongolian Chicken was greasier than I like, especially because I asked for the dish to be prepared with as little oil as possible.The fiance ordered Black Bean Chicken - a favorite of his from his lifetime of living in NYC - as well as the steamed dumplings.  He very much enjoyed his chicken, though remarked that something was missing that made it different from what he's used to.  However, he did like the nice pop of spice that Chinatown added to their recipe and said he'd order the dish again.  The fiance was also excited for the steamed dumplings, which he thought might be similar to the soup dumplings he misses so much from NYC.  They were indeed similar, though smaller and less soup-filled than the ones he loves.  Again, though, he'd order them upon returning to Chinatown.Though we both enjoyed our food, we were a little put off by the service we received.  We found our waitress to be flippant and unfriendly, and we never received the soup noodles, oranges, or fortune cookies we saw other tables receiving when ordering similar items.  Considering we ordered from both the lunch and dinner menus and paid a nice (though reasonable) price for our lunch, we were disappointed that we didn't receive the same treatment as the other customers in the restaurant.Regardless, for Chinese food that actually tastes like Chinese food, we'll be coming back soon for more.",Chinatown Restaurant,6152693275,126 reviews,2013-11-04,"Nashville, TN",/biz/chinatown-restaurant-nashville,4.0,119,"Nashville, TN",Tracy F.

"3900 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"This is the only Chinese restaurant in Nashville I will frequent. It gets five stars due to the fact that is so much better than anything else around here and because BUBBLE TEA.I've spent a decent amount of time in China (on my own, not on one of those micromanaged tours where they won't let you order your own food), which doesn't make me an expert, but does give me a good frame of reference for what mainland Chinese food should taste like. The Chinese food on the menu at Chinatown is basically a greatest hits of Chinese cuisine- a few Szechuan dishes, Shanghainese soup douplings, Beijing duck, and some American Chinese favorites. Not much Cantonese food to be found, but I'd actually they rather not try to do that AND all of the other stuff they're doing. Anyways, Chinatown offers a mixture of authentic and American-influenced dishes at reasonable prices with good service. The xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) are decent and can't be found anywhere else in the area, at least as far as I know, and I was happy to find that the twice cooked pork had the same flavor profile as the twice cooked pork I used to eat in Shanghai. The dishes here aren't overly sweet or cornstarchy; my only quibble is that I wish they could serve food at something closer to the spice levels I'm used to. Having heard a customer berate the owner for serving ""inedibly spicy"" kung pao chicken, however, I understand why we can't have nice things. I'm interested to see how they continue to balance the need of the average consumer to eat what they think of as Chinese food with their apparent desire to become the kind of Chinese restaurant that has a fish tank (all of the real fancy Chinese restaurants I've been to have fish tanks).ALSO IMPORTANT ADDENDUM THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE IN TOWN TO GET DECENT BUBBLE TEA AFTER THE SAD DEMISE OF FAT STRAW. There are a couple of other places with boba, but they have in my experience been pretty gross.  Chinatown is serving bubble tea somehow in conjunction with Quickly, which is a popular chain of bubble tea restaurants on the coasts.

So that made them more inedible. General Tao Chicken - more breading then meat!!! and the breading was too greasy. Really no Fortune cookie!!!! If you can not get your to go business right!!!!

"3900 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"As a native San Franciscan/Californian, I've lived in Nashville for little over a year and the ONE ethnic food that was lacking authenticity was Chinese food. Yes, I know there are plenty of ""Chinese"" restaurants in Nashville, but those restaurants are catered to those who are not open to try the real authentic dishes of mainland China (Duck over rice, Peking Duck, Shanghai Dumplings, Steamed Sea Bass, Hot Clay Pots, Bean Curds(Tofu),etc). I was depressed that there wasn't at the very least a some-what authentic Chinese restaurant that would satisfy my cravings for good Chinese food until I found this place.  If you're the type that loves the Americanized Chinese dishes such as General Tso's Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken/Pork, etc... you can still find it here. But let me warn you, ever since their reopening, their forte is NOT the Americanized Chinese dishes and instead their forte is their ability to cook authentic Asian dishes that range from Taiwanese, Shanghainese, Hong Kong, Central China, and Cantonese (tip: food in China varies by region so Chinese food is very broad). As a Chinese-American myself, I and grew up with home cooked savory Cantonese food, and great variations of Chinese food throughout California. In addition, I've lived in China and can confidently say this restaurant is the Holy Grail of authentic Chinese food that is comparible to that of the aforementioned. Before their reopening, the cooks at Chinatown traveled to all parts of China to learn the different techniques to the variouis types of cooking styles (contemporary and traditional) of Asia (mainly China and Taiwan); I know this because I asked the owners and the authenticity was explained after trying the dishes. You really can't get more authentic than that. I've spoken to other Chinese restaurant owners in Nashville, and many know the type of authentic Chinese food I'm talking about but ALL believe that Americans, especially Southern Americans, are not ready for REAL authentic Chinese food. So I applaud Chinatown for their bravery to make this move.Tips to Yelpers: Don't be afraid to try the native Chinese dishes. Ask the waiters/waitresses how to eat certain dishes if you don't know how. It's very common in the Chinese culture to start off with soup (Taiwanese Won Ton soup is goood), then move on to appetizer, and share many plates of vegetables and meat dishes amongst your party. Dine in Chinese food is meant to be served family style.I'm not affilated with Chinatown, nor have they asked me to post this review.

"3900 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"With a generic name of Chinatown Restaurant, how could I not resist? Heck, even if they had named themselves Chinese Restaurant, I would still try it out.Standard disclaimer: I love Americanized Chinese food, which I consider a separate cuisine than authentic Chinese.And this place was delicious.The decor was interesting. I think it was vinyl that covered the tables. Back home, my friends who were ABC (American-Born Chinese) told me the best Chinese food were always in hole-in-the-walls, where there was almost no decor. Places where the bus boys would pour hot tea on the glass tops covering the tables to loosen up any food stains. Here at Chinatown Restaurant, they actually decorated the place. Looked nice.There were booths and tables.I was given a free appetizer of fried wonton skins. I don't remember if that was plum sauce that accompanied that, but the yellow stuff was definitely hot Chinese mustard.The oolong tea was soothing. And didn't taste strong by the end of my meal. It wasn't the type of tea where bits of leaves would fall into your cup. Perhaps it was tea from bags -- the bag didn't come with the pot.Had my go-to standard of sweet and sour pork. They offered the sauce on the side, which was a nice touch. The sauce wasn't heavy on the sweet or the sour. Made me realize that I can cut back on both without sacrificing flavor. I loved the fact that they offer some dishes as sides: I had the green beans with black bean sauce, and it was a perfect amount. I came here early in the evening, and it was filling up with families with kids. I overheard a woman who was telling her young child that the [?] were as good as those from the Chinese restaurants back home in New York. The place was pricy for me, but given its location, I was willing to let that go.Staff was so friendly. Even though I could tell she spoke Cantonese, I told her in my piddling Mandarin that I was not Chinese (because I get asked that a lot, and she asked me if I was).A definite place to treat myself to good Chinese food.",Chinatown Restaurant,6152693275,534 reviews,2011-11-30,"Loma Linda, CA",/biz/chinatown-restaurant-nashville,5.0,119,"Nashville, TN",Ruiqiu K.

"3900 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"Ridiculously rushed service ruined what was intended to be a nice family dinner. I ordered the edamame and hot & sour soup to come out together with the other entrees, since we ordered four apps to start. First my soup came out, followed a few minutes later by the four apps, immediately followed by my edamame.  She even presented it to me by saying, ""your entree"" while trying to find space on the table. When the other 3 entrees were delivered just a few minutes later,  the guy delivering our food just stood there, looking at our completely cluttered, full tabletop with appetizers we hadn't had time to finish and asked if he should bring it back later.  Our waitress just proceeded to push and stack plates to make some room.  So, now on the table: soup, edamame, 4 appetizers, 4 appetizer plates, 2 bowls of rice and 3 different entrees.  We just looked at each other in shock - it was 2 hours until closing time, we didn't understand the rush.  We had no choice but to roll with it.  The worst offense was when our waitress actually brought to-go boxes to the table when we were clearly still eating. (And hadn't asked for boxes.) We had been seated for less than 35 minutes at this point, so we certainly were not just lingering.  The pros: hot & sour soup was good, pineapple shrimp was very good, pan-fried dumplings were good. The cons: obviously the service.  We'll give it another chance, making sure we are in another server's section.  Also receiving negative points is the duck.  My boyfriend had to cut around a lot of bones and gristle, and said that the ratio of actual duck meat to gristle was not worth the price or effort.  With so many good reviews and a few dishes with promise, we will give it one more shot (asking for a different server) and hope that this was a one-time fluke.",Chinatown Restaurant,6152693275,12 reviews,2014-01-27,"Nashville, TN",/biz/chinatown-restaurant-nashville,2.0,119,"Nashville, TN",Kay D.

"3900 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"On the basis of one visit, Nashville seems to finally have a Chinese restaurant worth eating at. For those who know the authentic cuisine, it is not the same as what one finds all around town just like BBQ sauce from a bottle on ribs does not make for real BBQ to those who love the smoke in the South. Of course, Chinatown is hardly new--it has been delivering the standard Americanized fare for years-which led me to avoid the place like I did so many others. But when I heard from the wholesale supplier of ingredients ingredients to Chinese restaurants in Nashville that they had hired new a new chef and revamped their menu, I could hardly wait to try. And the meny does include many things that are not for the faint-of-heart from beef tendon to chittlins. Indeed, if there is any pattern, it is that menu shows some Taiwanese dishes for the first time in Nashville. On the one visit, we tried the beef tendon appetizer, squad and pork, and pea greens. While I have had more tender, um, tendons (these were not sliced through and picked up like a line of paper dolls), the flavor with chili inflected oil was tasty. The Squid and Pork was a solid dish with some cabbage and black beans. The pea greens--long a favorite--did not disappoint--we were enraptured just to find it here. And so apparently were the number of asian patrons enjoying the food. So here is a hearty agreement with Nathan B. Now is this the best Chinese comparable to The San Gabriel Valley in California, the San Francisco Bay area, Flushing or Chinatown in New York City etc? Well not quite. But it good enough to save a trip to Marietta or Chamblee-Dunwoody for the the real deal.

"3900 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"O.K., let me start with: What Chinese food around here isn't at least somewhat Americanized? Americanized or not, Chinatown is a cut above the Chinese take-outs and buffets that litter our local landscape. Sit down Chinese restaurants (that aren't buffet) are a rarity around here, and it's nice to go out sometimes for a real Chinese meal. It does get crowded here, and when it does, there's a real atmosphere you don't expect from a tiny place in a strip mall. The food is also much better quality, and you can tell it's going to be as soon as you look at the menu. Chinatown offers steak and seafood dishes as well as brown rice. That's what impressed me: the brown rice. The only other Chinese place I know of with brown rice is P.F. Chang's. There's evidence of real cooking going on here, and I see more care going into their dishes than most of the other Chinese places I've eaten. My dish, which I asked for ""spicy"" came with a whole dried chili infused into it, which gave it a lovely, natural, not overdone flavor. The meat dishes have a healthy serving of vegetables, and not just the usual ones you associate with Chinese cooking. The broccoli was still green and fresh and my beef dish had fresh carrots, zucchini, and celery.

"3900 Hillsboro PikeNashville, TN 37215",3.5,"How does that saying go...""If you build it, they will come.""  Why doesn't that apply to Chinese food?  Why does chinese food in Nashville have to be Amereicanized?  Is the Nashville palate that poor that they can't appreciate good, solid chinese food that is prepared with fresh vegetables (and plenty of it) and lots of flavor?I really just don't get it.  Chinatown restaurant was disappointing.  More so in the fact that when we asked the owner what their best dish was, he seemed a bit bashful and replied apologetically, ""Well, all the dishes are Americanized..."" yes, sir.  Say no more.  What he's basically saying is, there is really nothing on this menu that will suit your palettes (because we are down home Chinese!)  That being said, I must say that this restaurant was mostly disappointing because their food was sub par.  When the fried rice was delivered, I was about to tell the waiter ""Oh, I asked for fried rice, not brown rice"" since that is what it looked like, but then she put the dish down and lo and behold there was ONE piece of egg I saw mixed in there.  I don't care what chinese restaurant you go to, the fried rice is usually made with white rice stir fried with scrambled eggs and usually a mixture of peas and carrots, sometimes green onions. Not here at Chinatown.  Just rice and the minimal amount of egg necessary to pass.  could't even really tell if it was real egg.We then had the mu shu pork, some veggie lo mein and a chicken and broccoli.  Mediocre at best.  But the veggie lo mein - again.  Where are the vegetables?  This lo mein came with a couple pieces of broccoli (uncommon for lo mein which usually is served with a plethora of onions, cabbage, carrots, snow peas), two pieces of baby corn (always from a can) and a couple slivers of napa cabbage.  I mean, come ON folks. I know you are serving a mostly American clientele (and judging from the reviews below, with not very discerning palettes), but still.  Quality really counts and if Chinatown were to up their vegetables and their presentation, more people would come!  It really would not take that much effort.So sad....",Chinatown Restaurant,6152693275,137 reviews,2008-12-18,"Los Angeles, CA",/biz/chinatown-restaurant-nashville,2.0,119,"Nashville, TN",B C.

"Nashville, TN 37219",5.0,"Today was the second time Ive eaten at the Mere' Bulles truck. First time was a couple of weeks ago. I requested, via twitter, that they serve the chicken & waffles at the Tues Donelson Food Truck meet up. They responded back nearly instantaniously saying per request they would do it! I was stoked to try this dish, and from them for my first meal. Was a nice boneless skinless breast. Seasoned and fried perfectly. The waffle was a nice belguim style waffle. It was slightly crispy but still soft. Was a great pairing and pulled off quite well.Today I had the Shrimp & Grits. Oh my! Ive had this dish a few times elsewhere. Today was a cool twist. It was a polenta style cake of grits with lots of shrimp. Didnt count but at least 8-10 shrimp in the dish. Nearly every bite had shrimp. The sauce was nice, slightly spicy, light cream based sauce with some red bell peppers in the mix. Loved the dish. This is top shelf Food Truck food IMO. These guys have a amazing truck and are always switching it up. I feel the prices they charge are legit as well. $8 for chicken & waffles (and I was full after). And $9 for the Shrimp & Grits.

"Nashville, TN 37219",5.0,"I am a food trunk junkie.  Let's just call me what I am.  I am totally not ashamed of this either.I had been wanting to try Mere Bulles Food Truck for quite a while because I had heard that they had Chicken and Waffles.  So when they finally made it to my part of town (Donelson/Hermitage), I got super excited.  And yes, I ate at their food truck 2 straight days...and it was glorious.My boyfriend had tweeted them the night before Visit #1 (as it shall be known) to request Chicken and Waffles.  And they tweeted immediately back that it would happen.  I did the Perfect Strangers ""Dance of Joy"" Balky Bartokomus style at this news.  I have never had chicken and waffles and have always wanted to try it.  And with the high reputation of the Mere Bulles restaurant, I felt confident that the Mere Bulles food truck would not let me down.  And they did not!  The fried chicken was actually about a 4-6 oz boneless chicken breast...lovingly breaded and placed atop a most wonderful and perfectly grilled round Belgian Waffle.  They then lightly drizzled maple syrup on top and added a super fresh and tasty strawberry on the side.  I definitely was not disappointed with my first Chicken and Waffles experience.  And truth be told, I could have eaten this all...day...long!!  It was priced at $8 and I felt it was properly priced.  My boyfriend made the comment that it could be more awesome with white gravy...and I'm not going to lie...it's blowing my mind to think about that option.  He mentioned it to them at Visit #2 and they were super receptive to the idea!Visit #2, I broke down and got their Macaroni & Cheese Burger...also priced at $8.  This burger is mammoth.  It comes with spicy grilled onions, tomato, pickles (bleh), bacon, some sort of white macaroni cheese sauce, and then topped with a fried macaroni & cheese ball.  Yes...this is decadence in a burger...and by decadence, I mean heart attack, but in a good way...if you know what I mean!  I got the house chips with this for a total visit price of $10.  I would like to take this time out to thank my boyfriend for picking off the pickles as I am not a fan.  But truth be told, whereas in normal burgers, you would still be bothered by the remaining pickle juice/smell/taste, this burger had so much going on, that I didn't have any Post Pickle Apocalypse happening.  The grilled onions on this are spicy.  The homemade chips were tasty.  The burger was delish.I also appreciated the fact that when I showed up for Visit #2, she knew me by name and before I could say anything, she had greeted me ""Hello Julie!""  I realize that I was just there the day before, but still...they see a lot of people.  So I really liked that customer service touch.  It made it personal and pleasant and friendly!Mere Bulles Food Truck has quickly vaulted into my Top 5 food trucks and as long as Chicken and Waffles are on the menu, they vie for that coveted #1 spot!",Mère Bulles Food Truck,,22 reviews,2012-04-26,"Nashville, TN",/biz/m%C3%A8re-bulles-food-truck-nashville-2,5.0,2,"Nashville, TN",Jules F.

"700 Old Hickory BlvdBrentwood, TN 37027",3.5,"This would be a 1-star review if it weren't for our sweet, knowledgeable bartender, Angel.  She was so incredibly helpful with descriptions and suggestions of everything on the menu.  She was great!Now on to the 1-star stuff.- Ordered a Caesar to start- Sesame salon was fishy, swimming in sauce (it was actually good sauce), mashed potatoes were gummy and the fried spinach was impossible to pick up with a fork.  I'm still not sure how you were supposed to eat it.  The two pieces I picked up with my fingers were so salty I had to ask Angel if I was on hidden camera because it was all so horrible.- Hubby got Delmonico....words cannot explain.  Maybe 7-8 oz. after being cooked, minimal seasoning (menu boasted some type of Chile rub which was barely there) and au gratin potatoes which were borderline crunchy and not even remotely memorable.- Returned salmon and got a side Caesar (oh, did I mention we never got the first one?) and coconut shrimp.  Both arrived in good time and were fine, nothing memorable.The only reason I will ever need to return to this restaurant will be for the ambiance...just drinks, no food.  Every ledge I looked at (bar and bathroom) had a good layer of dust, we had fruit flies because of the infamous pineapple jug and the food just did not match the décor or prices.I remember visiting one of the very first restaurants they have in Durham, NC about 12 years ago when it first opened and I remember being blown away by the food and service.  Now I am feeling like they have  turned into an Applebee's with very beautiful décor.  :(",Firebirds Wood Fired Grill,6154257240,62 reviews,2014-12-01,"Nashville, TN",/biz/firebirds-wood-fired-grill-brentwood,2.0,62,"Nashville, TN",Stefanie M.

It is a work of art and worth seeing. I am just not the kind of person who takes photos everywhere. We were seated in a booth in the dining area. Nice and comfortable.We were looking over the menu when we realized we had not seen a waiter for drinks, probably a 5-10 minute wait. More vexing was the number of waiters who were standing by the open kitchen and not circulating in the dining area.1 soup and 1 salad to start the meal. The chef has added potatoes to the corn chowder and the potatoes overwhelm the corn flavor.Ordered the pepper crusted steak, medium. It arrived at the table and only took one bite to decide to send it back, steak was well done.

"700 Old Hickory BlvdBrentwood, TN 37027",3.5,"Date night, feeling like steak and eating close to home. I had been thinking about BrickTop's in Cool Springs, where I'd had an amazing peppercorn steak a couple weeks back, but this was closer. First stop: hostess station. She makes a frowny face and explains that they have a wait list of 35 minutes. I say no problem, is there someplace we can sit for a drink while we wait, looking over at a bar area to her right. She looks behind her, lifts blinds on the windows (it's night time), and again with the frown says the patio is full. Then she asks if we want to be put on the wait list. I say, again, yes. She gets our name, and again I ask if there's somewhere we can get a drink. And this time she says yes, anywhere in the bar area. Okay. In we go, have a seat, and a waitress is immediately there to take our order. But almost before she  walks away, we get the text that our table's ready. We explain to the hostess that we have a drink order on the way, and she says she'll take care of it. A separate hostess seats us, and we explain the drink situation to her as well. She too  says she'll take care of it. A few minutes later, our dinner waitress comes over and asks us for our drink order. We explain for a third time. She asks whether we want a separate bill for the drink order and the meal, I guess code for ""Do you want to make sure you've tipped the other waitress""? I say it would be easier to just add it to our dinner check if that's okay, and she says yes, and asks what we ordered. After a bit, two new people come to the table, each one bearing one of our drinks. I guess it's because my dirty martini must be poured into my glass in front of me. A few minutes later, the original waitress from the bar area comes by and drops a bill on our table. Okay, I guess there's been some lack of communication, and we'll settle up. So, out comes the credit card, which is weird because we're just sitting down to dinner. Our dinner waitress comes by after a bit, looks quizzically at the check, and says she's already added our drink order to our bill at our request. So, we can put the credit card away, then, I ask? She says yes, and takes the bill away. This is turning into a complicated evening.I'm delighted to see a peppercorn sirloin on the menu, because I'm still thinking of BrickTop's. I order the steak rare, and I get the obligatory explanation of what ""rare"" means. Why do some restaurants do this? Can't you assume people know what they want?We are asked if we want bread, and say yes. Takes some time, but another server wanders by with that, looking a bit confused. Maybe most people don't accept the bread?When my steak comes out -- yet another server -- it's a rather sad looking affair in the middle of a gigantic white plate. The steak is about a half inch thick, and I can tell by looking at it that it's not rare, but I'll be okay if it's close enough. I take a bite from the edge, and no word of a lie I felt like doing one of those spit-it-into-your-napkin moves. Peppercorn crust is great, but it seemed to also be encrusted in salt. I cut into the middle of the steak, hoping that it's just the first bite's proximity to the edge, but no, it's just as bad, probably because the steak's so thin. BTW, it's also medium.Waitress comes by quickly to ask how we're enjoying our meals, and for only the second time in my life, I say, ""This is not good."" Now, I have had not-good meals before, but politeness usually keeps me from saying so. But this is the only thing on my plate (should have noted before now a pleasant caesar salad preceding the steak), and I don't want to eat it. She apologizes and asks if I want something else, and I'm thinking, ""No, I want this, only edible."" So I decline, and she walks away.About a minute later, the last of our entourage visits the table -- a manager type who asks how we're enjoying our meals. I explain that I'm not, and he whisks the steak away to try again, which I appreciate. ""Medium?"" he says, looking at my dish. ""Rare,"" I say. Meanwhile, my husband is engaged with a a pasta and chicken dish that he finds equally bad, but I tell him only one of us can complain at a time because I don't want us to seem like that awful couple. I taste his dinner and he tastes mine -- he agrees mine is inedible, I think his is edible just not good. Second steak comes out, slightly less salty and cooked closer to rare. Bottom line is, you can't cook a half-inch steak rare, and a sirloin steak should not be cut that thin. The waitress explains that they hand-cut their steaks, which makes me think someone should get fired. Looking around us, we see lots of happy folks with meals in front of them that looked good, so I think the uneven reviews of this place on Yelp are probably accurate -- can be good if you order the right thing. I prefer less of a crap shoot when I go out, though. The waitress did her best, and I appreciate that we were not charged for my meal, without any request on our part.",Firebirds Wood Fired Grill,6154257240,12 reviews,2014-10-04,"Brentwood, TN",/biz/firebirds-wood-fired-grill-brentwood,1.0,62,"Nashville, TN",Sandy C.
"700 Old Hickory BlvdBrentwood, TN 37027",3.5,"We started going to Firebirds about a week after it opens and fell in Love right away. Bentwood has long needed a nice upscale steak/seafood restaurant that has great food and great service. All we really had before was Mere Bulles on south side and Long Horn which is mid scale at best. We like it so much since the 1st visit we now go at very least once per week.The location is a tad busy outside but don't let that distract you as they have valet and plenty of private parking.They do take reservations as well as walk ins.The decor is very nicely lit for lunch and very romantic for dinner. I particularly like the stone wine wall. Speaking of wines Firebirds has a very nice selection from a good price point up to a moderate price point from both bottle and by the glass. I find the wines wonderful and the staff very helpful in offering tastings to try one if you cannot make up your mind. I Love the white SB Kris myself while my fiance' enjoys the Kim Crawford red Cab. They do offer happy hour I believe 4-6 during the work week w/ several inexpensive smaller portions of food like fish tacos and burgers.The 1st time we visited when they first opened I had the Colorado salad w/ grilled chicken.This has fast become my favorite salad for lunch there and they have a dinner portion.This salad is really no more than the price of the prices of the full salads at California Pizza Kitchen or Cheese Cake Factory but w/ a much classier environment and wait staff. I think comparable to J Alexander's or similar.My Fiance' Like Firebird's steaks best. He often has the New York strip or the Filet. He's very particular how his steaks are done. He wants them done medium well and not butterflied! I love my steaks med-rare they always get them right and they always come by to make sure they are done to perfection for you. I saw one complaint on here Honestly I've been to this place probably 25 times easily in the last 6 months, I live out here and It's like she went to a different place b/c I've never ever gotten bad food or bad service. It's amazing. If it's not they ask you within a short period of time after you get your meal, you can express yourself then and I am very sure the mgr would make any adjustments. He's always been out there visiting tables and very hands on when we are there-Every time we are there. Maybe the price was what they didn't care for idk but Hey it's Brentwood and it's classy.The wait staff is very professional and very sweet. They are very attentive and they have gotten to know us now.Jefferson is the mgr there. He always is out on the floor asking us how our meals are, if there's anything we need? He doesn't just do this for us-This is what he does,I've watched him. He makes all his customers feel special. If it's not right he will make sure it's right, but I tell you the food there is awesome so I think you're going to love it.We've tried the salads, the chicken tortilla soup is awesome! It's a tad different than most places it has a drop of sour cream in the middle of it so if your up for trying it, it's amazing, but if you don't care for sour cream ask them to leave that out. We've had the steaks, the coconut shrimp I've tried & loved over and over! The port mushrooms as a side we always get them w/everything : ) The spiced green beans also good. The sweet potato fries very good, The pecan encrusted trout yummy! That's One of my favorites! One more thing do not leave without trying the chocolate flourless cake. It's a perfect ending like chocolate butter that melts in your mouth. I was wrong this is the last thing They have a few flavored coffee drinks for after dinner desserts too so if you're feeling full or watching fat grams these are super too and they are Not skippy with the alcohol ask for a side of the house whipped cream w/ one yum!!

"700 Old Hickory BlvdBrentwood, TN 37027",3.5,"In spite of my less than sparkling review, this place will do well due to location and hipness.  Décor is nice and shiny so the young, hip group will love it.  The older, wiser group ( I include myself here) think $11-13 cocktails to be ridiculous.  Server was very good!  Nothing negative to say there.  Started with the ahi tuna appetizer.  Unfortunately, while seared perfectly, the flavor was lacking.  The highlight of this app was the small salad they gave with it.  Not a bargain at $14.75. Not even worth $10 in my opinion.  I expect fish, from an establishment of this ""caliber"" to be flown in at least on an every other day basis for freshness.  Heck, a local burger establishment near the house does this.The sirloin my wife had was decent and cooked well but lacked flavorThe chili rubbed Delmonico, again cooked well, but lacked flavor.  How is this possible when rubbed with chili?The superstar of the meal for me was the scalloped potato side.  They were delicious.  Verdict?  1 app, 2 glasses of average wine and 2 entrees equaled $88.  I don't have an issue paying a premium price for a premium meal but this is Longhorn fare at best.  Save your mediocrity and go to local places for better meals at lesser or at worst, equal pricing.",Firebirds Wood Fired Grill,6154257240,14 reviews,2014-08-31,"Brentwood, TN",/biz/firebirds-wood-fired-grill-brentwood,2.0,62,"Nashville, TN",John M.

At that point the server while walking by remembered to ask us if we wanted bread. Bread is tasty with a cornmeal crust.  Then our main dishes came. Mine was very nice chicken pasta. Nice kick to the flavor. However the other dinner was a steak dinner. The green bean side was nice.  The steak was sent back., they cooked a medium steak to well done. Second time was better, but as it had not rested, juice left the steak once it was cut.  Other notes, wait staff is standing around in front of the kitchen (highlighted by kitchen lights), waiting.

Because of the confusion and long wait time, the manager comped a dessert, which was nice of him. There were lots of servers milling about - it just felt kind of chaotic, but that could of been because we were seated in a middle table that felt kind of like ""Grand Central Station.""  It was also a bit expensive ($20+ per meal).

It's a bit small but we got there right in time on a Saturday to have a short wait. But by 11 the line was getting a little crazy outside. Service was awesome and prices are very reasonable. The ladies kept checking in on us and coals were always readily available. Mixed drinks and hummus were excellent and affordable as well!

"2206 Elliston PlNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"It's been 6 months since my last review and I've been here way too many times and I still love it. I've learned to avoid weekend nights if I just want to relax and have some hookah, so this place is great. That being said, over the past few months, some things have changed. More recently, they added ice hoses, which I've yet to try but seems like good for variety. They also changed the coals to coconut from regular coals, which I think is more expensive but I actually prefer the regular ones. Now what's the same is most of the staff her, which are nice and helpful and remember what I always get (ha). The tobacco used for the hookah also seems to have stayed the same, seeing as I always get the same flavor (Grape Mint) and it always tastes the same (aka amazing). Another thing to mention, and actually the reason I found this place, was that they have hookah for 8 bucks on happy hour (read: anytime before 8pm). During happy hour they also have house wine for $3 and all beers half off I think.Overall, still a great place for hookah, that gets busy even on some weekdays and Sundays. Also pretty good happy hour deals. Oh, and a belly dancer comes on weekend nights as well.",Aladdin’s Hookah Lounge and Bar,6153293558,244 reviews,2013-01-21,"Austin, TX",/biz/aladdins-hookah-lounge-and-bar-nashville,5.0,45,"Nashville, TN",John S.
"2206 Elliston PlNashville, TN 37203",4.0,"Aladdin's definitely gets an A++ for the best shisha, mint tea and happy hour specials a hookah bar has to offer in Nashville. After the renovations a few years ago they definitely stepped their ambiance ratings up too, it still isn't the best compared to other cities but it's much better than it used to be. The location in town is perfection; free parking is almost always available (although you may have to walk a little bit) and it's away from tourist populated downtown. The bar gets pretty crowded on the weekend (belly dancer night) and week nights, so expect a little wait. The one thing that absolutely kills this place's rating is the customer service which gets an F.

We got guava mixed with mint in a pineapple bowl with an ice chamber hose. The blend was great, and the coals were replaced by a pro, so it never got harsh or ashy.

"811 Dickerson PikeNashville, TN 37207",2.0,"I am not sure if they are still experiencing growing pains, but this meal did not live up to the hype that surrounds this Chicago tradition. The lady at the front counter is a bit rude. We placed our order and was told it would take about 20 minutes, which is no big deal since they cook orders as they are taken. We actually ended up waiting for about an hour for the meal because there was some sort of mix up in the kitchen, some tickets were misplaced, and our order was given to another party. The meal itself was mediocre at best. The chicken was seasoned well, but the sauce tasted like glorified ketchup...it was not good at all. The mild sauce on the wings was also bland and did not have much spice at all. Mediocre fries and slaw as well. Harold's is going to have to do some shaping up to stay in the game. There are many more chicken/wings places in Nashville that are way better, with better service and better food. Also, seeing at they are located within only a few miles of these other, well established chicken spots, they definitely need to get their act together quickly. All in all, I am going to give them one more try to get it right. Maybe after they have been open for a while and get a real system down, the meal and service may be more pleasurable.

"120 21st Ave NNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"This place has by far the best hookah in Nashville.  I usually cough at least once during a hookah smoking session, but the hookah smoke at Tarboosh always slides down my throat just like oxygen.  Yeah, there are a few harsher flavors, but they're few and far between.  My favorite is the triple apple.  It literally tastes like homemade apple pie...in gaseous form!I love the atmosphere too.  I see a lot of reviews saying that the atmosphere is trashy, but that's kind of the point, if that makes any sense.  Hookah is a Middle Eastern tradition.  When I go to a hookah lounge, I want to feel like I'm in the Middle East, minus the crazy terrorists and religious wars.  Tarboosh does that.  No, it doesn't have air conditioning or heat (as far as I know), so don't come here when it's really hot or really cold.  Smoke at home.  I always come here on pleasant nights.  They keep the windows open, and there's even outdoor seating.  There's not even any need for indoor smoke filtration because it all escapes into the outside air.  This place is basically a small shack.  It's all wooden walls and concrete floors, and there's cushions on benches lining the walls.  There's also a nice widescreen TV hanging up in the front playing Middle Eastern music videos, adding even more to the raw, Mediterranean-ish vibe.They also serve fresh, flavored, hot tea.  This goes really nice with hookah, especially if you pair the flavors right.  For example, I love my triple apple hookah with cinnamon tea.  It helps the harsher hookahs go down smoother.The only complaints I have about Tarboosh is the pricing and the absence of alcoholic drinks.  The price isn't so bad if you have two people, but the thing is that it's $12 for one OR two people, and if you have a party of three or more, you have to start paying per customer.  I can't remember how much it is per person, but it seems a bit unreasonable that you should have to pay extra for more people, even though you're all smoking from one single hookah.  I guess that's just their way of making extra money.  And, like I said, there is no alcohol.  I'm sure it's just because they don't think it's worth getting a license.  But I like to drink cocktails with my hookah.  It's not a huge deal though because I still love the tea.  If you want to drink, I suppose you just have to go to Aladdin's.",Tarboosh,6153205909,33 reviews,2012-04-30,"Goodlettsville, TN",/biz/tarboosh-nashville,4.0,24,"Nashville, TN",Nick B.

"120 21st Ave NNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"I was quite happy here until an employee assaulted me. Here is the story. This is most likely a non-generalizable experience, but I still would not go there. As one of the few places that has food after the bars close on church street, my friend and I went here for some food and hookah after Play closed. We got vegetarian platters that were good. The falafel hit the spot. The hookah was nice too. We sat in a corner and relaxed and talked. When I went to the bathroom, I leaned against the tank of the toilet and it snapped off. Where the bolts attach to the tank just snapped. I have been using toilets for most of my years on this earth and have never seen this happen. I turned off the water so it would not run and then went out and told someone that it broke. I got yelled at and was told that I would pay for it. I said that I would not and went and got my friend to go. They would not let us pay for our check or leave. With the hostility that was happening, we tried to leave and then an employee grabbed me from behind and put me in a choke hold and took me down to the ground. We called the police (who never showed up) because we were not being allowed to pay for our meal or leave and I had been assaulted by an employee. Finally, the owner arrived and let us pay and go. There were three guys behind all of this mess. Other servers and patrons saw this happen and told us that they supported us and what was going on was messed up. I dislike being assaulted and I also dislike things breaking (I get it, it sucks but things break when they are old). I did have a good 3:30am meal and half of a hookah before things went downhill. Next time I will skip the late night meal and just go home. I have enjoyed this place in the past but now knowing that the employees do not hesitate to assault customers, I will not be back and will encourage others to not patronize this place. Luckily we left and were not injured by the employees. I was quite concerned for our safety. Take that for what it is. An accident that led to being physically assaulted by an employee.

"120 21st Ave NNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"Tarboosh is a staple hang-out for underclassmen living in Kissam Quad from Vanderbilt University, and for good reason.The atmosphere here is almost exclusively outdoor seating, or outdoor-like, with a covered patio or picnic tables out front for seating.   Extremely casual-- you'll probably feel overdressed in anything but blue jeans.Tarboosh's best qualities:  Cheap hookah, fantastic hummus.  Seriously, the hummus is incredible.  They boil the chick peas and make it fresh in-house.Drawbacks:  Everything else on the menu.  If you're craving an Indian night out, eat at Sitar next door and then wind down at Tarboosh afterwards.  Tarboosh's food leaves much to be desired.  Also, a little hookah know-how can go a long way here-- often the coals are not entirely ignited, or you get too many coals and the smoke can draw very hot (or not at all)!  Grab your resident hippie to accompany you and act as firewatcher to get the most out of your hookahs, which by far are a fantastic deal.  Try the watermelon!  The service isn't all that fantastic, but for the target audience, is sufficient.All in all, a fun place to take 3 or 5 friends out for a nice evening.",Tarboosh,6153205909,10 reviews,2010-08-08,"New Orleans, LA",/biz/tarboosh-nashville,3.0,24,"Nashville, TN",Rachel U.

"120 21st Ave NNashville, TN 37203",3.0,"We ended up going here because our first choice was 21 and up and not all of us are, but overall really wasn't very impressed at all.  Maybe I just don't get it, but setting was only so-so with cushions strapped down to cast iron benches?, but that wasn't the main issue. The hookahs didn't come with mouth pieces, and apparently they have been out of them for about a month. They assured us that the equipment is consistently washed before each use, but still, mouth pieces are kind of a significant piece of the experience.  And a server can tell me as many times as they want to that something was done right, but at the end of the day, I'd rather not try and be convinced that something's clean, I like KNOWING it is.The food was mediocre, and when we said that the fries were just not good, the offered to ""pat them down"" to degrease them. (Pat down the fries?!) Then they offered to take the fries back to the fryer for a little longer, even though it wasn't that they weren't done, they just weren't that good. And then after we had been sitting for 20 minutes, we were told that we had 5 minutes before they were closing.  A head's up at entering would have been nice instead of ordering hookahs, then food, then being asked to leave right away.  You go to a hookah bar for the experience and the time to relax, and it was a fail on both accounts.Good intentions, and everyone was nice, but just not worth the stop.",Tarboosh,6153205909,16 reviews,2010-05-04,"Nashville, TN",/biz/tarboosh-nashville,1.0,24,"Nashville, TN",Cassidy N.

Sometimes it's great times, sometimes it's really really not. Their servers tend to be friendly enough, but problems with bills sometimes lead to conflict with their management. Regardless, I think Tarboosh's appeal is their great ambiance. With its small patio on 21st it's a great place to smoke Hookah and hang out with friends (though sometimes the crowd can bring the laid back feeling down). As for the Hookah's themselves again it's a mixed reaction. They do have a good spread of flavors, but it seems that more often than not the Hookahs are poorly washed and tended to, so you end up with a harsh, dirty, and abrasive experience. With rivaling hookah bars springing up around Nashville, I don't think Tarboosh is exactly my favorite (you can get better quality tobacco at Tabouli's) , but still I don't think it should be dismissed because it does provide the great atmosphere for a night of Hookahs and friends.",Tarboosh,6153205909,328 reviews,2008-10-18,"San Francisco, CA",/biz/tarboosh-nashville,3.0,24,"Nashville, TN",Mariela C.

"5805 Nolensville PikeNashville, TN 37211",3.5,"Jonny's (previously named Jonathan's several years ago) has evolved into a good local sports bar for South Nashvillians.Until about a year ago, we frequented this bar for UFC fights - which was beyond convenient since the alternatives included a drive downtown or to Smyrna. However, the owner stated fees were raised to publicly show fights, and he felt it was just too much money to pay. Thus, no mas UFC.To fill the void, the bar started offering more trivia and poker nights - neither of which I'm particularly interested in. But it's good to still see some familiar faces when I occasionally stop by for a quick beer or to watch a Preds game.It is evident Jonny's has a very low staff turnover, which is rare for the industry.The food is surprisingly good; one step above bar fare on some dishes. I especially like their Mediterranean pizza.It is the last dish you'd expect to see on the menu at a place like this - ""Grandmom's Eggrolls"" are actually made fresh daily by the owner's wife, and pretty darn good.There is a lot of seating available - a full wrap-around bar, high tops and four tops, as well as seating around the two pool tables.Jonny's does not have outdoor seating. However, when the weather is nice, they'll roll up the garage doors (and there's a bunch of them), which allows for a nice breeze.It's a 21 and up bar, and be forewarned, smoking is permitted.

Most of the servers are very attentive even when the place gets packed. They have a pretty diverse selection of beers on tap, more than most places I have been. I would guess some where around 15 to choose from. A lot of the food is your standard bar fare but for a bar their pizza is surprisingly good. The Mediterranean white pizza is fetish of mine that I can never resist and a large majority of my friends agree... its something special. I can't believe i say that about a bar's pizza but it really is that good.The not so good:It gets really packed for UFC fights. You should consider calling ahead to reserve a table. Even then unless you call a day before you might not get a reservation. Also parking on a popular night can be a headache.

This is a religious experience and if you have never tried Ceviche then you must try it here. Ceviche is a dish where they take seafood usually white fish and shrimp and they mix it with finely chopped veggies like onions, avocado, tomato, jalapeno (kind of like pico but a little chunkier). Then you smother this thing in lime juice which ""cooks"" the white fish and shrimp. It really is a Christmas miracle but the seafood changes color and taste cooked but with so much more flavor and not the slightest bit fishy. The dish comes with these crispy tostadas that you ladle the ceviche on and BAM, taste explosion!!! My husband would also recommend the chicken chimichanga which is packed with flavor and huge.

Definitely a step-up from the normal fast food joints, the burgers are hearty, I have never been disappointed with one to date. They are pretty straight forward, burgers, fries, fried foods, hot dogs and other unhealthy american eats (save for the grilled chicken wrap which is a bit healthier if you forgo the sauces). What honestly makes Sonic good is the drink and dessert selections! Limeades, floats, milkshakes, sundaes, fresh fruit slushes - for treats this is the where its at and at great prices! Recently Sonic added some hot dogs to the menu for only $1.99, each loaded with different ingredients ie; Chicago Dog, Chili Dog, etc. I have tried 3 of them and while I am not a huge hot dog fan, this is a great late night or lunch choice with one of their specialty drinks or milkshakes - each of the variations I tried were tasty.

It was not uncommon for the timer to hit 15 or even 20 minutes as we waited for refills or - especially - checks. Even on nights where the restaurant is far from capacity, they are very inattentive.

The margaritas also progressively got worse and smaller.  Cheap is good, but even cheap margaritas can eventually go bad.   This one isn't there fault, but the kids have also found this place in droves.  It became more fun to count the number of times we heard ""like""  than to catch a buzz, and that is really a shame.   Like what the hell happened?  This is like soooooo disappointing!  The real loss is not being able to eat and drink here, and then go shopping at Kroger's.  You could miss the rush, and enjoy the perfect insanity that only Krogering has to offer.  Btw, don't by any liquor next door.  The prices are absolutely ridiculous.   This is coming from someone who used to say that alcohol at any price is a bargain!",Las Palmas Mexican Restaurant,6152921902,44 reviews,2012-07-02,"Nashville, TN",/biz/las-palmas-mexican-restaurant-nashville-3,1.0,40,"Nashville, TN",A A.

I have been back three times since, and to two different locations (so it is not the cook), and they are awful. They are watery, mealy, and the cheese is terrible. Not fresh. You went from having the best, to the bottom of the list. If you are trying to save money here, you are making a BIG MISTAKE. Raise the price if you must, but do not cut back on quality and freshness. These taste frozen, institutional, and lifeless. Do your customers, and yourself a giant favor and go back to the homemade in each restaurant. We have not made it a habit to shop Mexican food in Nashville when we want authentic Mexican, but we are about ready to start.

I ordered one of the combo meals that came with one beef taco, two chicken enchiladas, and rice (you can order beef, chicken or pork as the fillings)...I think it was something crazy cheap like $6.75.

Like any chain, the food was good, but was a little rough around the edges. Prime example being that a few of the pizzas (three to be exact) had pieces squished together in the box - the pizzas were not transported properly. It kind of looked like someone tried to wrap a whole pizza into a ball.Still, the pizza TASTED good and the delivery person was friendly.

Being new to the area and looking for a late night dinner (damn time zones) this was our only option. We all groaned and rolled our eyes but set forth in hopes of eating something that might be a slight upgrade from the weeks worth of fast food we had been living on. It started off rough, we left my purse at home and didn't have my ID (I should have known better than to order a mixed strawberry margarita. Don't judge. I was in a mood...) but the waitress was exceptionally patient with us as my husband scrambled to get home, get the purse and back with only an hour before closing.

More people sitting at the bar and more cars in the parking lot, but we were seated immediately. The waitress was quickly at our table introducing herself and taking our drink order. Tony ordered the $2 small draft of Budweiser (14 oz) and I ordered my unsweetened tea with lemon and lime. We went over the menu slowly because we haven't been there for a while. I opted to order off the Weight Watchers friendly menu, The Napa Chicken with Mushrooms/Onions season Zucchini and peppers with Oven roasted potatoes with a Soy Based sauce..sort of sweet and bitter but good!!! Tony ordered the Cajun Steak and Shrimp plate with spinach, tomatoes, onions mushrooms and oven roasted potatoes. It was looked really good on the menu.

Mine looked delicious but Tony's plate was all wrong....they brought the wrong entree the Cajun Shrimp Pasta..I stopped the waitress...hey..this was the wrong entree and she was like...oh but I thought that is what you wanted...so we were like NO WAY, please bring the right entree..So we had to wait..and mine was cold by the time they brought his plate. But his was delicious!!! Worth the wait...mine was cold..it would have been good if hot!!!  The waitress brought Tony another beer and myself a tea refill but she didn't take anything off the check..The manager walked by us three or four times, he could see my plate sitting there and Tony with no plate..no one offered to recook or even reheat mine..I was very upset but I didn't want to send it back because I didn't want any unwanted items added to my plate....((( spit, hair, etc..)) so I have decided NOT to go back to this Applebee's ever again..which is a shame because it is so close to my apartment..but hey there are a ton of additional restaurants in Nashville just waiting to take my money and feed me!!!

"335 Harding PlNashville, TN 37211",2.5,"I don't like to write reviews for chains. I think it's generally pointless, given that the majority of diners know what to expect when choosing to dine at Applebees, Chili's, and the like. In my experience, the expectation is decent-ish food and decent-ish service, without expecting too much, but expecting just enough to make it worth the $10 or so you'll spend on your meal. Would you believe that I was so furious with how I was treated at this Applebee's in particular that I not only left a $.66 tip (to round the bill to the next dollar), but I left a snarky note on the receipt?The server seemed to be not only disinterested, but annoyed with our mere existence at her table and made sure not to exert more than the littlest possible amount of energy on us. She made no effort to hide her impatience during the beat of hesitation my fiance displayed while deciding between salads. Food was delivered by someone else because he ""couldn't find her."" Water was never refilled. My fiance's ""bottomless salad"" was never refreshed. The bill was dropped off and picked up without a word as she walked past the table, apparently en route to something more interesting.

I asked the hostess (middle-aged woman with a British accent) who my server was. She asked around and discovered that they went on break before I was sat.

When the driver arrived my total was $18.01. I thought that was too much so I called the restaurant. The gentleman informed me of a delivery charge and state tax. The delivery charge was $4.99. That was not mentioned on the phone and was not listed anywhere on the menu. I went ahead and paid for the food because I was hungry and it was getting late. When I opened the bag I discovered two things. 1. The bottle of Coke was a 16.9-oz. bottle not the 20-oz. that I paid for. 2. The dressing I requested for my salad (that was included with the lasagna) was not in the bag. So I had a salad with no dressing. The lasagna had pools of grease on top of it. To say I did not enjoy my $18.01 dinner would be an understatement. I probably would have ignored the soda and dressing if I hadn't already been deceived by the delivery charge.

"2215 Elliston PlNashville, TN 37203",2.0,"NO, DON'T BOTHER!! I have finally had my last meal from NY Deli after 12yrs of horrible service and multiple ownership changes. The only thing that has improved over the years is that it no longer takes 2hrs or more to get food delivered in the neighborhood. Most other aspects which were not really all that good to begin with has degraded to terrible. Why did I keep ordering from them over the course of 12 yrs? Usually drunken desperation, but now there are other places in the area that deliver (Tazza, Cafe Coco, etc). Here's an example of last night:Accuracy of order 1/5:I call in and order fried mushrooms, french dip sandwich without onions, and chicken alfredo. He repeats it to me and then asks what dressing for my side salad with the pasta. It arrives in about an hour and when I go through my order I find the french dip is not only with onions but there's more raw onions on this thing than meat. The bread was also burned. I had no dressing for my salad, and my order of fried mushrooms contained exactly 8 mushrooms (no ranch dip) and strangely, two random mozzarella sticks.Quality of Food 1/5:    First off before I really get in to the quality I gotta mention that the alfredo pasta is served as a blob wrapped up in a sheet of aluminum foil as opposed to how they once served in in those round aluminum to-go pans with a cardboard top. It's difficult to eat out of the sheet of foil and can be messy.*French Dip: Okay well, their version of ""au jus"" tasted like fatty brown water. Seriously it had no taste, I think it was maybe made as 1 part beef bouillon cube and 20 parts water. Really, I couldn't even eat this thing. As stated above the bun was burned to a black crisp and the onion to meat ratio was outrageous. *The alfredo was cold and a much smaller portion than it used to be served as, also the amount of chicken in it was meager. *The mushrooms were very few, there was no dipping sauce for them unless you like mushrooms with marinara and upon biting in to them it was clear they were underdone. Most of the interior was still a runny yellow raw batter -it was gross. While I wasn't given a full order of fried mushrooms there were two random fried mozzarella I didn't order. We all agreed they might have tasted good if they weren't cold and hard.So while they make gross food and have for years, I'll give them one thing, the guy on the phone was kind of nice I guess.

So when we found this little place just outside of Nashville we were excited by a chance to enjoy a traditional southern breakfast and an authentic environment.

I had very specifically explained to her that I cannot tolerate any dairy, that it literally makes me quite ill but she still buttered my toast and had to remake that and then my eggs came out sopping in yellow forcing me to have to ask again if they had used butter. Now if the place had been busy, I would understand how she could make these mistakes but now it's clear to me why we were pretty much the only ones in there. So I wait again while my toast and grits are getting cold for them to remake my eggs.  I'm thinking, yay finally and am to enjoy my favorite go to comfort food.  Grits eggs and toast has been my go to favorite meal my whole life and I've not had much opportunity to enjoy it since traveling so extensively most of the time.  But oh my gosh, looks can be ever so deceiving.

I ordered 6 bagels to go (an assortment of blueberry, cinnamon raisin, poppy and plain) and one toasted everything with plain cream cheese. My total was around $8. Before I really begin, I do want you to know that I am not a fancy bagel person. I like a good chewy, soft bagel with delicious, non-flavored cream cheese. I don't like the frou-frou honey-maple-walnut-whatever cream cheese that so many people are into now a days. And I don't believe that sweet bagels (cinnamon raisin, blueberry, etc.) should be served with cream cheese...put butter on those if you need something! I realize...this is probably a little picky. My husband says so. That's okay with me. The first thing I noticed with Bruegger's was that the bagels are smaller than traditional NY bagels. They have large holes in the middle where I feel a NY bagel should have almost no hole because it should be so thick. The second thing I noticed was that the cream cheese was sweet. Not tangy, like good cream cheese is. That was disappointing.Now the bagel itself was right on! Perfect amount of everything toppings that rubbed off as you ate it, the flavor was perfect! Savory, salty, nutty. It was chewy, and soft and toasty in all the right ways.The poppy seed bagel turned out great. The plain was just how a plain should be. I really love the texture of these bagels. I am not a blueberry fan, but my kids gobbled them up. I didn't really care for the cinnamon raisin so much. As far as the service goes, the girls were nice but not particularly friendly nor did they seem especially interested in their job. My personal pet peeve about bagels is that you should never, EVER put overpowering bagel flavors together with other bagels. For example, you shouldn't put an everything or onion bagel in with an egg or blueberry, nor should you mix cinnamon raisin with sesame seed. With my order, all of my bagels were placed in the same bag. My poppy tasted a bit like cinnamon and I had to pick poppy seeds off of the cinnamon raisin. To be fair, I did not request them to be separated. (But I kind of feel the same as if my bagger at Publix put apples in the same bag as my chicken. It should just be a given.) My children specifically requested chocolate chip (which they have previously had at Einstein Bagels), but I didn't see this flavor at Bruegger's.I would definitely go back. Their breakfast sandwiches looked really good! The coffee smelled delicious, even though I am not really a coffee drinker. I would say give it a try, but it's not quite so authentically NY as they claim. I will continue looking for another local bagel place that tastes a little more like what I had growing up.

"219 Largo DrNashville, TN 37211",4.5,"Located behind Shell gas station.This food truck provides the best Mexican food in greater Nashville area. When I moved here from soCal 3 years ago, I constantly craved quality Mexican food that was plentiful back home. My two Mexican classmates (one from East LA and other from Fullerton) and I spent so much time and money looking for decent Mexican food in Nashville.After 6-8 months, we gave up on actual restaurant establishments throughout Nashville. They all catered to non-Hispanic clientele, substituted quality by slabbing beans and/or cheese, or were regularly devoid of customers overall (for good reason). Instead, the three of us tried EVERY Mexican food truck that we came across over the last three years. We were very religious about this. If one of us spot a Mexican food truck, we'd take note of the intersection and made sure we'd try it before the end of the week. I've eaten well over a dozen or two Mexican food trucks in Nashville over the years. One truck(s) came out consistently on top: Taqueria Express. I have two soCal Mexican friends to back that up (one of them surprisingly cooks very well).Even if several of these trucks populate the same block or two on Harding, Taqueria Express always had considerably more Hispanic customers. Even while waiting for my order, at least two or three cars would drive up, park, and place orders. This does not happen at other Mexican food trucks and I don't blame them: they're not as good as Taqueria Express.I'll be honest in stating that I've been disappointed by the rave reviews that a number of Mexican restaurant establishments have received on Yelp. That's why when it comes to ethnic foods in Nashville, I trust the crowding of ethnic customers more so than high scores on Yelp (ie Seoul Garden). Taqueria Express is another great example.Don't get me wrong, a few other Mexican food trucks will provide an item or two that will top Taqueria Express. Some tacos will be better found elsewhere, depending on your personal preference on the ratio and balance of various ingredients. But as a whole, the meats are more flavorful, more juicy, and remind me of the food I've eaten within 1 hour from the Mexican border.My personal favorite meats at Taqueria Express, in this exact order: 1 pollo (chicken), 2 pastor (spicy pork), and 3 beef (carne asada). I personally like the quesadillas, mulitas, sopes, and burritos.This is where my confusion lies. There are a small number of food trucks in Nashville called ""Taqueria Express"". With my limited Spanish (and their limited English), the employees have stated that these ""Taqueria Express"" trucks are from the same company. I'm not sure if they're all owned by one person who licenses out these trucks, if they're distributed as a franchise, or are jointly operated by the Mexican Mafia. If you look at the city licenses taped on each of these trucks, they're all registered with a slightly different name, address, or person. Yet the menu items are identical, the menu pictures are identical, the prices are similar, and if you ask the people who work there, they say they share the same recipes and ownership.I've asked each truck how many trucks are under the ""Taqueria Express"" company (my classmates have asked them in Spanish as well). Each truck has given a different number, whether it's 5, 6, 7, or 8, all in the greater Nashville area. My classmates and I have located, pinpointed, and eaten at exactly four of these Taqueria Express trucks. We have searched high and low for the remaining 1, 2, 3, or 4 trucks (your guess is good as mine). I'll post reviews of the three remaining Taqueria Express trucks (that I've found) on Yelp as well... I hope the Yelp gods and goddesses don't mind me copying and pasting since their food items are almost identical. ;-)I'm so happy to post this review--now I can finally check-in at Taqueria Express several times per week. I love the chicken quesadilla. Be warned though: a number of the non-English speaking customers will hand you their odd business cards for who knows what. I've collected a stack of business cards from other Mexican customers over the last 3 years. I have no idea what these businesses do. I don't speak enough Spanish and they don't speak enough English to explain to me what that's all about.",Taqueria Express,,116 reviews,2011-07-11,"Houston, TX",/biz/taqueria-express-nashville-3,5.0,3,"Nashville, TN",Tin N.

I think this place's two finest achievements are convenience and garlic bread. They are on GrubHub, so you can just put in the whole order online. Delivery is free with a $10 minimum. The garlic bread is exemplary; rather than going down the roll or breadstick route, they give you a little loaf which packs in the great cholesterol-pumping elements.

"6345 Charlotte PikeNashville, TN 37209",4.0,"OK, I admit it. I can be a Mexican food snob. But, I am willing to always try something new when it comes to tacos and south of the border drinks.One lazy Sunday morning my GF and I decided to skip left overs and venture out to see what this place was all about. How intriguing, a Mexican buffet! With 2 for one drinks even! I call, they are open.This review is based on one visit during the lunch buffet.The vibe and decor are nothing special. You are here for the $4.99 buffet and 2 for one margaritas all day. And there lies my problem. The add in the local papers lures you in with such advertising. And after calling and confirming that they were open and had 2-1 margaritas/beers we decided to give it a try. How bad can it be? Through broken English I was informed during my call that the beer machine was broken. OK. We still had margaritas yes? Yes.Upon arrival we made our way in and inspected the buffet. Interesting. The manager (same guy was on the phone) sat us and took our orders. Again I asked about the 2-1 margaritas and he said Yes. They are $2.50. OK, deal. We settled in and hit the steam tables.Spanish TV played and a few mixed locals were chowing down. The buffet is OK. Drinks small. There were some nice breakfast eggs, fajita mix, ground beef (enchiladas too), Mex pizza, a salsa area, soup, salad, etc. Your basics. The chips and salsa were nothing to write home about but the red sauce from the buffet was really good. Winner! The breakfast Flautas were quite decent. Stuffed with potato and egg. I slathered soft tortillas with beans and filled them with salsa, pico and the breakfast eggs. Yummy. The fettuccine was a little out of place so I passed. The margaritas are just the basic over ice. You would need 10 of them to get a buzz going but they added to the meal. Basically there is a little of everything for everybody. Not the best but not the worst in town. I could definitely hit the place every now and then for a cheap local Mexican breakfast and some drinks.We enjoyed ourselves and the meal having tried almost everything up at the steamers. The manager came by our table and again informed us about the hours and that the beers were two for one as well when the machine is working. We asked a few more questions and if there was a happy hour. He said yes and gave the hours. Hmmmmmmm. Maybe a dinner some time.We were done after 3 small plates and headed to the register. At the register one of the other waiters rang me up. With tax it was $11 and change. I asked if this included drinks, yes. OK. Great deal, back soon! Paid with a card and then the manager comes up with another receipt for the drinks. Another $11. and change. Wait a minute...... I explained we had two for one drinks as advertised in the Scene. ""2 for 1 all day margaritas"". Nope. 4 small margaritas are $2,50 each. Only during happy hour is the 2 for 1 he says. What? The add says something different, this is false advertising. If there was a full shot in the drinks I might understand $2.50 but seriously. You are going to lie and cheat me out of a few bucks? So there is no beer, no two for one drinks all day. Just on happy hour? How do I know this? Why are your adds deceptive? Why are you arguing with me?The manager feigns bad English and tries to explain. Again, the add says all damn day. I tell him ""you told me on the phone and face to face before we ordered"". I would have left rather than be taken. He shrugs. Fine. I pay and am gone. So El Jaliciense, is this how you run your restaurant and treat new customers? Its not that hard. You have the 615 market cornered on Mex buffet but your service blows and so does your manager and his communication skills. You advertise something that is not true and that is against the law. Are you going to make it better? I could come back. This could be a good little thing. You could actually tweak the quality on the food a little and have real drinks. And true advertised specials. You would have customers lined up. But....My first and last trip there if this is how you treat people.

We had really great food! I took Jolene's recommendation and got the ribs with the potato salad and baked beans. Omgosh. It was amazeballs. My husband got the ribs plate (this was bigger than my portion) with collard greens and grilled cabbage which he also raved about.

Super-friendly owners that make you feel very welcome!  It pains me to give them a negative rating, but since they moved locations, the quality of the food has gone down.  The meat seems to be either too dry or to fatty. The sides are so-so, which I hate because they're mac n cheese used to be SO good.  (the baked beans are still pretty nice and flavorful though!).  The bbq sauce they use now seems store-bought, and they are very stingy with giving it to you.  I placed a to-go order the other day, and I would not have had any sauce had I not thought to ask about it on a whim.  And on that note, i was given two little half-filled cups of the sauce which is nothing when compared to the nice sized proportions they give you.  The only upside I can see in their move to the new location is that there is more space.  Plenty of room to sit down and eat, and even for a live band.",Papa Turney’s,6158668850,28 reviews,2015-08-07,"Hendersonville, TN",/biz/papa-turneys-hermitage,2.0,65,"Nashville, TN",Hattie J.
"3979 Bell RdHermitage, TN 37076",4.5,"I am giving Papa Turney's a conditional 4-star rating. Here's the deal. Anyone who has been there knows it should get 5 stars, all the time, no questions asked. But seriously, run out of beer AND brisket, and then blame it on a busy Saturday? Sounds like lazy to me. Ok, so the distributers can't deliver beer on Sunday - does that stop you from BBQing some brisket? Apparently so. Not chickens or ribs, just brisket. It just pissed me off is all.So we settled for the ribs and chicken. My daughter inhaled her ribs before I could even think of taking a picture, but I did snap one of my chicken plate. The chicken was very moist and flavorful and wow, did they get the smoke into the meat! Not overpowering at all, but a pleasant smokiness through and through. The mac and cheese was tasty but cold and a bit congealed and the greens were just a bit over seasoned (read too much salt) but I'm not really complaining because we were eating out of styrofoam containers and using plastic utensils. Talk about a landfill nightmare, but it is the south so I guess it ain't nobody's business.Loved the ambiance. We sat outside because it was a wonderful day and the singer inside, while pretty good, was so loud we couldn't even hear the guys behind the counter. They couldn't hear us either and did apologize for how loud it was. I was hoping we could hear him outside but with the windows closed it was a pretty well sealed building. Looking over the docks was fantastic. This is another reason to want to live in Nashville. I just hope Papa Turney's doesn't let the atmosphere lead them down a path to indifference. They could be a BBQ go-to place.I plan on making it a point to go back there the next time I am in town. They will either go up to 5 stars or drop to 3.

"3979 Bell RdHermitage, TN 37076",4.5,"The barbecue is very good and the view is worth the price of admission. We have had the pulled pork and the ribs. I think everything is homemade.  The mac n cheese doesn't seem to have a lot of flavor but the baked beans are good. I've been here twice, and I think your service experience is going to vary depending on who is working..The owner was there on a Sunday and everything was great and came out fast. On Tuesday, same week, we went back and there were teenagers running the place. It was extremely slow, took about 30 minutes to put together four orders. We had two separate tickets and somehow orders got placed in between us, so here we are holding our orders, waiting an additional 10-15 minutes for the other couple with us to get their food so we can get back to the boat, so ours got cold. Plus, the girl making the orders was chopping up the meat one order at a time. It was like three pulled pork orders and here she is chopping up one portion of meat, boxing the sides, etc. one at a time before moving on to the next order. So she had to get each item out every time, etc. Not efficient. If it wasn't for the poor service on the second visit, they would get 4 stars. Last but not least...I still haven't figured out if there is any legitimate boat parking at the Nashville Shores Marina where this restaurant is located. The first time we went, the guys who man the gas pumps told us where to park...then we look out while eating to see them moving our boat so that another boat could take the space. The second time the space was empty so we just parked in the same place.

"3979 Bell RdHermitage, TN 37076",4.5,"There's hundreds of BBQ spots in the Nashville area, none of which hold a note to Papa Turney's, at least not one I or any of my friends (who have lived here for decades) have found. Papa Turney's does what most BBQ places dream of: offer chicken and spare ribs where the meat literally falls off the bone. And, when we say fall off the bone, we mean it. You don't need your teeth to pull it off. It's that impressive. On the other hand, Papa Turney's isn't your typical restaurant. Positioned at the marina above Percy Priest Dam, you'll find plenty of boats, anglers and bikinis during the summer, which is why it's so odd to find such a hidden gem here. The building isn't contemporary. You're fed with Styrofoam plates and on tabled you'd expect to find in a backyard at grandmas, but the food is exceptional. From the homemade sides to the spare ribs, pulled pork, and chicken, no corners are cut. Everything is done with the objective that no customer should ever take a bite that isn't exceptional. And, speaking of that, there's no better brisket around, literally. I've been to almost every Travel Channel BBQ spot in the US and this brisket holds a note against the best. It's that good. One thing not to overlook are the desserts. The pies are incredible. I was sad when we found out they have sweet potato pie seasonally. We missed it by a week, but as good as the chocolate pie was I can only imagine how good the others are. The folks here can bake and cook and are some of the kindest you'll find in The South, period. You'll feel like you've been a part of their family for years, with your first bite. Special Note: Their sweet tea is different, too. They add plenty of lemon to provide an added flavor. It's not traditional Southern all-sugar sweet tea. Give it a try. You'll probably enjoy it while listening to the awesome live music while you eat.",Papa Turney’s,6158668850,1169 reviews,2015-01-18,"Chatsworth, CA",/biz/papa-turneys-hermitage,5.0,65,"Nashville, TN",Chris S.
"3979 Bell RdHermitage, TN 37076",4.5,"The official address for Papa Turney's is a bit confusing. The restaurant itself isn't on Bell Road, although the turn-in for the Nashville Shores Marina is. Their new home overlooks Percy Priest Lake and the marina, which is certainly a nice change of pace. It was far too cold for any aquatic activities today, but I'm sure this location will be booming come springtime.This seems to be a family operation. Papa Turney (aka Mike) himself came over and chatted me up for a bit. I learned a little about the history of the Turney family, which was pretty cool. He also described their quality control standards and said that he has no problem throwing away a whole rack of ribs if something doesn't look or taste just right. Papa Turney struck me as a genuinely friendly guy who really loves what he does.I ended up with a combo plate of brisket, ribs, and hotlinks, with potato salad and mac and cheese on the side. I also made sure to request sauceless meat, and they were happy to oblige.The macaroni looked like basic Easy Mac, but it had a nice cheesy flavor. It was also great comfort food on a chilly day. I could see plenty of diced pickle scattered throughout the mayo-based potato salad, and I could definitely taste the hard boiled egg. It was a little too sweet for my liking, but otherwise very good.Truth be told, I had originally intended to order pulled pork as part of my three-meat combo, but my Texas Trinity reflex must have kicked in and instinctively ordered ""brisket, ribs, sausage."" I actually didn't realize it until my order came out. Oh well. The hotlink sausage was good, though not overly spicy. It had a good crisp casing, too. I couldn't pinpoint all of the spices I was tasting, but I enjoyed them nonetheless. When Papa Turney learned that I am a native Texan, he instantly told me that they serve the brisket chopped because it actually comes out too tender to slice properly. That makes sense, and even though the meat was lean, it was definitely tender and juicy. I also found a decent smoke level, as well as good pieces of chopped bark and smoke ring. The seasoning was simple, but tasty.The pork ribs had a nice crust and a dark pink smoky hue. The rib meat fell off the bone with almost no effort, but still clung to itself nicely. It was moderately smoky and had a good amount of salt. The pork was also very juicy. Something about the texture wasn't quite right, but then again I'm also accustomed to Central Texas barbecue, so who knows.For no reason in particular, Papa Turney offered me a free mini Chess Pie to take home. I definitely wasn't turning down his delicious generosity. In a word, delicious! It had a diabetes-inducing amount of sugar and butter, which can only be found in Southern desserts. I also noticed hints of what I think were brown sugar and vanilla. Next time I hit up Papa Turney's, I'm buying at least a dozen of these!I'm really glad I decided to give Papa Turney's a shot.

Excellent after taste. Even the belching tasted great. When we arrived music band already playing blues. The setting is on the marina.

"3979 Bell RdHermitage, TN 37076",4.5,The BBQ is good. I enjoyed the first couple experiences there. The last 2 times I've been the people taking the order at the register are like it is the first time they have ever done it. It is slow and they always leave something out. The venue is too small for a live band and take out is always a wait even if you order ahead.,Papa Turney’s,6158668850,6 reviews,2015-07-22,"Hermitage, TN",/biz/papa-turneys-hermitage,3.0,65,"Nashville, TN",Chuck J.

"3979 Bell RdHermitage, TN 37076",4.5,"The. Best. BBQ. Ever. Five stars do not serve this place justice. Service is exactly what you would expect in the south - hospitable and absolutely friendly. Papa Turney himself is amazing man. He comes out and speaks with customers, and emphasized his dedication to serving good food and treating people well (love it). Pulled pork has a particularly special place in my heart. And Papa Turney's has the most amazing and juiciest pulled pork sandwich ever. I could ever one of these every day and never tire. The ribs were so well seasoned and the meat practically fell off the bone.

"3979 Bell RdHermitage, TN 37076",4.5,"Lovely view of the water and boat, though the place itself is very small with a large order counter and a few mis-matched chairs and tables.  The live music was good but too loud. I literally could not hear the woman who took my order.  I did a to-go order; I would suggest sitting on the deck if you plan to eat-in.But you don't necessarily look for amazing ambiance when you go for BBQ, right? You go for amazing BBQ.  And the pulled pork was delicious.  Juicy and flavorful - really enjoyed it.  The baked beans were good; the slaw was...meh.I want to try the lemon chess pie, but they were out. Maybe next time.The finding the place was a fiasco.  My GPS took me to a copse of trees across from an apartment complex about half a mile away.   I called and they said ""we're across from the apartments."" I said there are tress across from here.  I asked if there was a cross street; ""not really but we're by the Marina sign"" was the answer.  So I went the OPPOSITE direction from what GPS suggestion and quickly found the marina sign - and then drove another 1/2 mile down to the water.  I guess if you know where it is, it's obvious -- but I don't know how they expect to find new customers.   It's not their fault that the phone GPS could't find them, but might I suggest a HOW TO FIND US section on the website, maybe some photos?I also struggle giving anyplace 5 stars when their website invites me to ""BRING THE HOLE FAMILY""  I don't like to hangout with the hole family, myself.  Just sayin.",Papa Turney’s,6158668850,163 reviews,2014-11-23,"Nashville, TN",/biz/papa-turneys-hermitage,4.0,65,"Nashville, TN",Jennifer P.

We had the hot sausage links, we had the ribs, and we had the pulled pork. The ribs were tender and juicy, and the smoky flavor was perfect. The pulled pork was exactly as tasty. The hot link sausage was just the right amount of spicy. Every single thing we tried was delicious and perfect. The cabbage was to die for. I could have eaten an entire bowl of it. The staff were so friendly and polite, and even though there were quite a few things not available on the menu, they were very sweet about it.

There is a sizable covered deck for when it's not unbearably hot.  I had the BBQ pork plate with macaroni and cheese and grilled cabbage.  Hubby had a hot link and brisket plate.  All of it was wonderful.  They have regular and spicy BBQ sauce on the tables, and the meat is served over bread.  The line was short (one person in front of us), but there's a steady stream of people coming through.  Speed was fine....not fast-food fast, but not slow by any means.

After a quick google search ""best BBQ in Nashville"" we decided to try Papa Turney's location on the marina.

The whole way down the road I kept saying ""THEY BETTER BE OPEN"", and low and behold they were. Mike Turney quickly greeted us, told us about his restaurant, asked where we were from, sat at our table and chatted for a while, and then thanked us several times for coming out in the nasty weather to try his BBQ.

"5215 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",2.5,"I love Asahi Sushi. I should preface this review by stating that if it involves mayo, a fryer, or fruit; I can promise you I'm not interested. I don't eat fancy rolls. Fancy sushi for me, is a unique fish that I haven't had before. Asahi's fish is fresh. As a result, the flavor is full and rich and the texture is perfect. Their house salad isn't the best that I've ever had. Their seaweed salad is good as well. I also really enjoy their vegetable tempura and the Japanese pickles.  If you are a nigiri sushi fanatic, ask the sushi chef what he recommends. The other night he suggested monkfish liver. It was really good. He's also got my boyfriend and I hooked on this amazing tuna and bonita. One of the rolls that we do enjoy here is the salmon skin roll. Crunchy and delicious. No one eats here. I don't know why. As a result, the service has always been really great! I don't think that they are slower than any other sushi restaurant. My ONLY problem with Asahi is that they are located in Belle Meade and it's a small hike for us to get over there. It's probably for the best.

We sat there forever waiting for our check and once we finally got it, we still had to wait ages to get our change.The sushi itself was overpriced and the worst I've ever had, and I'm a big sushi fan (I've been to all types of places - the restaurant doesn't have to be high-end to have good sushi). The rice tasted old and stale, and the fish was tough, chewy and bland. I will never come back to Asahi again and you should stay away!",Asahi Japanese Sushi,6153528877,256 reviews,2011-08-08,"Nashville, TN",/biz/asahi-japanese-sushi-nashville,1.0,15,"Nashville, TN",Eliza R.
"5215 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",2.5,"I should preface every sushi bar review I write with - if I could I would eat sushi for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.Asahi is a mix of good and disappointing.The good:Service - wonderfully friendly and fast.Sushi (as in the vinegar rice) - solid.The tamago (egg) - good.  (I have been told that it is tradition to have tamago at the end of the meal.)The disappointing:The fish - Overall, the fish was of poor quality.  Most pieces lacked the ""pop"" of flavor that I expect from the raw fish served at sushi bars.  The texture was also subpar.  Most concerning was that some pieces were overall to ""fishy"" - ""fishy"" is a bad way.",Asahi Japanese Sushi,6153528877,95 reviews,2010-10-23,"Winston-Salem, NC",/biz/asahi-japanese-sushi-nashville,2.0,15,"Nashville, TN",Colin S.
"5215 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",2.5,"Mongolian BBQ = 4 starsvariety of foods = 3 starsdeserts = 1 starscustomer service = 1 starO.K... I'm not quite sure WHY the Bellevue location isn't listed, but this review is for that specific location:  It's the only place around here (Bellevue) where you can get Mongolian BBQ, so for that alone, I give it much praise... HOWEVER, How difficult would it be to employ SOMEONE WHO SPEAKS ENGLISH????!!!! Everyone from the waitress, to the guy behind the desk to the manager...I had a difficult time trying to request ""to-go cartons"" because NO ONE SPOKE ENGLISH. I also needed to talk to someone regarding an event happening here in Bellevue, but all anyone could say to me was ""I don't know"".  I've lived in foreign countries, and I've learned the language (at least enough to converse with someone), and yes, it was a challenge, but I did it. It was the respectful thing to do for the people of that country (both Korea and Japan), that I would care enough to want to speak their language. I don't want to come off as a xenophobe.  I'm truly not, and I think my travels and my life experiences would prove just the opposite.  So, to the employees of the Bellevue location:  you're here, you're employed, you're making money, in fairly safe surroundings, and can partake in everything that America has to offer.  Please show us the respect, and learn the damn language!",Asahi Japanese Sushi,6153528877,6 reviews,2013-09-06,"Nashville, TN",/biz/asahi-japanese-sushi-nashville,2.0,15,"Nashville, TN",Dianne F.

"5215 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",2.5,"I got some good news this morning so I decided to celebrate by treating myself to sushi for lunch. I've driven past Asahi a hundred times, always meaning to try it, but just made it in for the first time today.When I walked in it was empty. I mean really empty - no hostess, no sushi chef in sight. I thought about ditching, but for lack of a better lunch plan, stuck around.  When I got to the table I was excited to see they had age-tofu, one of my favorites. It was bland, and the tofu was a bit soft for my taste, but it turned out I was glad to have it when I got the rest of my meal. The spicy yellow tail roll was one of those large, sloppy sushi rolls which was ok, but not good, and definitely not spicy.  The kicker was that the unagi nigiri I ordered was REVOLTING. I had to spit it out! (tmi, maybe, but it's true) Unagi is usually my favorite, and I was shocked. I was too embarrased by the soggy, half-chewed fish in my napkin to send it back so I ended up paying for it, which I'm still regretting.I won't be back at Asahi, and I recommend you look elsewhere for your sushi fix.",Asahi Japanese Sushi,6153528877,241 reviews,2010-05-28,"Austin, TX",/biz/asahi-japanese-sushi-nashville,1.0,15,"Nashville, TN",Kyla A.
"5215 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",2.5,"We have been visiting Asahi for years and it is our favorite around Nashville. It is usually not too crowded, so we can get in and don't have to wait forever to eat. There is only one sushi chef, the owner.  He takes pride in his work and is a really nice guy.  He remembers customers and always greets them when they walk in the door.  We love the spicy scallop and volcano rolls. It isn't overly priced or pretentious, which is another reason we like it. Good sushi at a reasonable price-what more can you ask for? Give it a try-you will be glad you did.",Asahi Japanese Sushi,6153528877,2 reviews,2012-01-02,"Pegram, TN",/biz/asahi-japanese-sushi-nashville,4.0,15,"Nashville, TN",Bethany B.

"5215 Harding PikeNashville, TN 37205",2.5,"Asahi is a pretty good Japanese style restaurant.  They have plethora of different sushi rolls, but other than that the menu is a bit simple.  Most of the rolls are pretty standard, but they do have a few signature rolls that looked pretty good.  I was really in the mood for sake the particular night I went and was pleased that they had a pretty good selection to choose from.  I was dining with some health nuts when I went, so we started with some edamame, which seemed fresh (I am pretty sure it is impossible to mess up edamame, as I think they only boil it).  For the entree I had the teriyaki chicken.  It was super juicy and it was covered with some sesame seeds.  Pretty good, but nothing spectacular.  Overall,  I thought the meal was pretty good and pretty cheap too.  It is probably worth it to check out this place if you are in the area, right off of Harding pike.",Asahi Japanese Sushi,6153528877,292 reviews,2008-09-05,"West Palm Beach, FL",/biz/asahi-japanese-sushi-nashville,3.0,15,"Nashville, TN",Robert K.

"1702 8th Ave NNashville, TN 37203",2.5,"A coffee shop inside a bookstore inside a music store inside a record shop!You could almost miss this location if you didn't know it was located inside / connected to Grimey's Too.  All your Frothy Monkey espresso-based favorites are here.  There are only a few seats and tables, so this is definitely more of a record shop than a place to plop down with your laptop and get some serious work done.  However, there is an awesome outdoor patio here with a ton more seating.  Definitely more of a place to go when the weather is nicer.I didn't spend more than a couple moments looking around at the music selection, but from what I can tell, they have some more rare and/or harder to find CDs.If I'm looking for a place with cozy indoor seating, I'll probably head to a different FM location, but if I want to spend some time with a delicious caffeinated beverage browsing through a great selection of music, then I will definitely come back here!",Frothy Monkey,6158911986,129 reviews,2014-12-05,"Nashville, TN",/biz/frothy-monkey-nashville-3,4.0,2,"Nashville, TN",Mike D.
"1702 8th Ave NNashville, TN 37203",2.5,"I HATE to give this one star rating - Frothy Monkey is my absolute FAVORITE coffee shop with the exception of the one inside Grimey's Too. I keep giving it additional chances, but it always falls way flat and I question why I didn't just drive the extra few blocks to 12th or walk to the one downtown which is very close to my apartment. I've actually questioned myself if it is really a Frothy... it's never on par with any of the others and I have visited them all, and frequently. Out of the last last 5 visits to this location I can remember, my coffee has tasted ""right""/good one out of the five times. The drink that I order nearly every time I am into any location is also $1 more at this one, which I wouldn't mind out of convenience if it tasted good. Today it tasted like the international delight instant coffee powder. I sipped about a quarter of the way through and decided to call it quits on it. Another time, I had chunks in my drink, which I was told was due to the type of local milk they use .. I stop into any one of the locations weekly, if not multiple days a week, and never had lumpy milk, and while I trust that they believed it was still safe to drink, I couldn't get past it and threw it away; it was strange. While I remain loyal to all the other locations; and that the baristas are still lovely at Grimey's Too - I can't help but choose not to go to this one anymore.",Frothy Monkey,6158911986,92 reviews,2015-02-02,"Nashville, TN",/biz/frothy-monkey-nashville-3,1.0,2,"Nashville, TN",Corie K.
