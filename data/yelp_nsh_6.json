In fact, this will only be my 34th one-star review out of 423. Aside from friendly service, there is nothing else good to write.At the recommendation of the waitress, I ordered the roast beef. I am from Texas, and in my mind, roast beef is sliced. Instead, it arrived in the form of chopped beef with brown gravy on top. It looked like vomit, and the texture was that of canned tuna. As I chewed, the meat made a squeaking noise against my teeth, just like tuna. It was disgusting.I ordered three sides. The first was macaroni and cheese. While the mac and cheese was creamy, it lacked much flavor. Garlic powder would've gone a long way to spice up the dish. The mashed potatoes were hard, but not cold, upon arrival. This indicates lack of milk or cream. The turnip greens were so sour I couldn't eat them. It's a good thing I declined extra vinegar, which was offered to me after the food arrived. The dinner roll was probably the best part of the meal.I was appalled at the portion sizes, which were meager compared to most soul food restaurants. There should've been double the sizes, even at the cheap prices. I've eaten at numerous soul food restaurants across the nation, and by far, this is definitely the restaurant with the smallest size portions. So, at this point, due to taste and portion size, I would give two stars.Add a hot chocolate, and my bill was $10.50, pre-tip. That doesn't seem bad, but I left unsatiated. In addition, the food upset my stomach (a rarity on my travels), hence the one-star rating. My stomach was so upset that instead of running errands, I had to return to the hotel for an hour.

The number one type of place I look for in a neighborhood is a great local breakfast joint. While I do sometimes miss Nashville Biscuit House in East Nashville, I believe Wendell Smith's has won my heart. I've always been a little bit nervous about trying out a restaurant that's in the back of a liquor store, but I'm sure glad I went for it. I've been there several times now and have taken some out of town friends there, and we all agree, the breakfast here rules! The bacon is cooked to perfection (something most places screw up), and when I order over medium eggs, they are actually over medium and not too runny! I usually double up on the breakfast potatoes and can rarely finish them, but they are some of the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had. They're sliced sort of like chips, but obviously way thicker, and are cooked to that perfect mix of crispy outside with a soft inside. The biscuits here are also done well. They are tiny, but super fluffy and don't have that bland flour taste that can happen with biscuits sometimes. Bacon, biscuits, and potatoes are my three favorite breakfast items and they deliver on all three. A rare feat in my book.The staff here is also extremely friendly and make you feel welcomed. I've always had great service and conversation with the wait staff and cashiers. I've never tried any of their meat and three options, but if I'm getting breakfast on the West Side and it's not Sunday, I'm definitely heading to Wendell Smith's.

Nothing fancy, just something better than the Kroger meat department. When I discovered that a small barbecue venture known as The Gambling Stick operates out of east Nashville's Porter Road Butcher on Saturdays, I had no choice but to check things out.The Gambling Stick is a pretty simple operation: smoker, table, coolers. What more do you need? I'd love to see these guys get their own brick-and-mortar shop, but for now their beach canopy setup at Porter Road Butcher works just fine. It's a pretty symbiotic relationship anyway, since these guys work at and get their meat from PRB. The butcher shop has some picnic tables on their patio, which works great for lunch. The smell of delicious smoke was almost too much to handle. I had to get my hands (and lips) on some barbecue ASAP!Each week The Gambling Stick has a slightly different menu. Today's special Barbecue Plate came with two meats, a summer vegetable salad, baked beans, cornbread, and sauce. Considering my third option was pulled pork, the choice of two meats was a no-brainer: brisket and pigsket (pork brisket). The pork brisket isn't something I've encountered before, so I was especially intrigued.Their summer salad had quite the assortment of julienned veggies: zucchini, squash, green beans, red onion, bell pepper, and probably some other stuff. The light, crisp vegetables were a good pairing with the heavy meat. I also really enjoyed the baked beans, which had only a slight sweetness to them and were more savory than typical baked beans. The cornbread came straight from a cast iron skillet. Mmmmmmm. Sweet, buttery, fantastic.For a native Texan, brisket was a welcome sight in a land of pulled pork. I asked for mine extra fatty, just to be sure. The crust was black as night, with a deep red smoke ring beneath. It was extremely tender, and each bite was packed with smoke and their tasty rub. I can easily say that this was some of the best brisket I've had in Nashville so far.Even though I knew this pigsket was likely coming from the lower portion of the pig's shoulder, I still wasn't entirely sure what to expect. Overall, it tasted similar to a pork loin, except way better and much more tender. No surprise, the pigsket had a great smoke level. The combination of crisp bark and well-rendered fat was awesome. This might be my new favorite cut of pork.The meat was so good on its own that I completely forgot to try the sauce, which is exactly the way it should be.

I don't usually like them but these were unique, much more sophisticated flavors than I've ever had. The Hummus was light, creamy, and tangy, but the real stars were the filo dough/cheese thingies you dip in a rose petal and cherry sauce. I could have eaten many more of them, and my girlfriend and I thought of a friend of ours who would have gorged himself! For dinner I had a spinach stuffed chicken breast and got both sauce options, as suggested by our excellent waitress. The coconut sauce was forgettable but the tomato was among my favorite from any cuisine. It was bright and tangy with just enough sweetness, and the basil came through in a refreshingly subtle way. Regarding the rice pilaf, my girlfriend said, \"I shoveled a fork into my mouth before I swallowed the last bite. I almost choked.\" Some greedy eating, which only happens with food you love.We finished the meal with a couple of Turkish coffees, and, you guessed it, the best I've ever had.

The Haydari seemed slightly different than last time too, but still delicious. Wine: They serve it. But, there's a reason Turkey isn't known for their wines. They definitely have other wines too.

While the stuffed eggplant and artichoke were good, the skewer of grilled vegetables was my favorite of the three. The food overall was very flavorful. I also tried two of the hot teas on the menu: the Turkish Hot Apple Tea and the Rosehip Tea. I highly recommend trying the Rosehip tea. Both were served very hot. Finally, the best part was the dessert. Upon recommendation from a friend, we tried the Kunafeh, which is a cheese center and a whispy crispy top and bottom (similar to shredded wheat). At first I thought it would be overly sweet, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was just the right amount of sweet. It's good to order this dessert when you order your main course because it takes about 20 minutes to be made. The service was superb. The server must have known we were new to the restaurant, because he was patient and helpful by describing the menu items when we asked and telling me his opinions of the tea.

D.\n", "review": "The Saturday following Thanksgiving. \u00a0Since I was away from home for the holiday, I didn't have any turkey leftovers. \u00a0So I asked myself: \"where does one go for leftover turkey?\" \u00a0I answered myself: \"Why, Turkey, of course.\" Since a flight to Turkey was out of my lunch budget, I opted for the Anatolia Turkish Restaurant, on Nashville's west side. \u00a0After driving over the hills and through the woods (well, I assume woods once stood in the area, now it's mostly Interstate) I began my Turkey hunt. \u00a0It was truly a hunt, since this restaurant is back from the road, hidden behind Calhoun's Pub. \u00a0My GPS also indicated that they were on the left hand (south) side of the road, and they were not. \u00a0That's what I get for putting my GPS on the British voice setting. \u00a0Always doing things on the wrong side of the road.The restaurant itself looks like it could of been selling clothes a week earlier. \u00a0The walls have the grooves to hang shelves or slanted racks. \u00a0Some of the shelving even held wine bottles, which was a nice touch for a place with no concept of ambiance.I seldom pass on a shot at a decent bottle of wine, and their wine list was an actual list, which is a good sign. \u00a0But the menu also had 2 hot teas available. \u00a0Noting that tea is a Turkish custom, and the hot apple tea would fill my 'thanksgiving leftover apple pie' need, I opted for the hot beverage.If you like hot cider, you'll like the hot apple tea. \u00a0Not very tea like, but quite delicious. \u00a0They serve it in a funny little glass, and keep it refilled. \u00a0I had like 3 or 4 glasses of the stuff. \u00a0It was good.The bread came out. \u00a0Now to get a review on the bread, well, it must be really good, or suck awfully bad. \u00a0This is the former. \u00a0Hot, toasty yet thick enough to still be bread, and tasty - with or without the flavored olive oil for dipping.The appetizers (5 stuffed grape leaves), were also quite flavorful. \u00a0They were cold, and that surprised the both of us. \u00a0I'm not sure if that's normal, but it tasted like it was right. \u00a0Like a salad in the shape of a egg roll.The Lamb came with a fair amount of spice. \u00a0Not hot spice, but a powerful spice that may wreak havoc if you have heartburn issues. \u00a0Not familiar enough with Turkish spices I couldn't tell what they were, but it pleased my palate.When they brought the lunch, we went ahead and ordered the Kunefe (they suggest a 20 minute lead time). \u00a0Of course by the time I finished my meal (and make no mistake, I couldn't stop eating) I was sorry we ordered even more food. \u00a0My sorrow would have to get buried in a plate of wheat and thin filo dough covered cheese. \u00a0The desert was clearly meant for 4, but there were only 2 of us. \u00a0We ate the whole thing.Nothing like being stuffed on turkey, unless it's not turkey. \u00a0And it wasn't. \u00a0It was lamb. The lamb might have been from Turkey, so I guess that counts. Did you know they don't have turkeys in Turkey? \u00a0Now I have to drive to Sandwich, New Hampshire to see if they have sandwiches there. \u00a0Maybe a turkey sandwich. \u00a0I digress...As a bonus, we came here armed with a coupon from the \"Entertainment\" book, which saved us $10. \u00a0After taking the $10 off the bill, the waiter gave us the coupon back, to use on our next visit. \u00a0And we will use it again.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 63 reviews", "date": "2010-11-30"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nCarolyn C.\n", "review": "What an amazing place!

Otherwise you might inadvertently end up with sheep's tongue or something on your salad. Not that there's anything wrong with that, if you're into sheep's tongue.)Anyway, the gyro was good, the salad was small and *very* lightly dressed, but it tasted fresh. My dining companions seemed to like their food (another gyro and a shrimp kebab plate).Incidentally, when my gyro arrived, it still came with fries, so I ended up with both fries and salad, but I think that was a small oversight on the kitchen's part. Having sampled both, I would encourage you to go with the salad. The fries are fine, but unremarkable. The salad is better and healthier for you.Service and ambiance are both nice.

You really can't go wrong with anything you order, but my favorites are the Anatolia sampler platter (particularly their filo roll, which is basically deep-fried, salty cheese in a pastry), the chicken stew (reminds me of a high-fallutin' chicken pot pie), and the iskender kabob (kabob meat topped with a savory tomato sauce). The portions are generous and the prices reasonable. Anatolia is a fixture on my list of go-to restaurants in Music City, and it doesn't look like it's going anywhere anytime soon!", "location": "\nWashington, DC\n", "exp": " 18 reviews", "date": "2011-11-03"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nSharon K.\n", "review": "Very, very tasty food here. \u00a0This place is tucked back in a strip mall, so it is very unassuming, but the food is first rate. \u00a0They have some delicious vegetarian menu items, like their vegetable Guvec which is a Turkish veggie stew with too many types of veggies to list!

This place deserves a better rating than that. I've probably been here seven or eight times at this point, and each time has been a good experience. It's a small, family-owned and operated place. The interior isn't very impressive, but then again I've never been impressed by a sandwich shop's interior. Each time I've gone, the owner has been the only one working (well, sometimes his daughter is there helping), and he's a really nice guy who makes great food and takes pride in what he does.As other reviewers pointed out, it's important to consider the alternatives in this area. 3rd Coast, for the price, puts these places to shame. Sure, it's not as quick or convenient as those places, but the quality of the food and the service blow the competition out of the water. \u00a0I'd much rather support this kind of place instead of yet another crappy chain. With only one person working, there can be a bit of a wait sometimes. Again, if you want truly fast food, this is not the place for you.

That is a plus.The menu is small. It has up to 15+ items but hey that can be good sometimes.As others say, this looks like any build your own sandwhich place at first.The price on everything is low/cheap which is under $7 (including taxes) Everything is fresh made which is another plus.You can chose to make a sandwhich however you like or just chose one from the menu.I got the broiled Shrimp sandwhich.I was surprized to see how perfectly cooked the shrimp looked. The taste is another story. It left a yummy taste in my mouth that I could remember. Just for that alone, I would come back for.In addition the that, the owner gave me and my friend a side cup of beans/corn with cream for free!He wanted us to eat the food first while it was still hot and fresh before we paid.Sure it took like almost 10 mins to make the both of our sandwhiches but it was extremely worth it.I'd like it if he added Fish. The menu says it could be changed from time to time.You have choices of Chicken, Roast beef, Turkey, or Shrimp sandwhiches.I want to try the alternative Mac and Cheese platter.Everything is homemade and fresh.I can tell its basically healthy food.At first look of the sandwhich, it seems like you could easily make it at home yourself. That maybe true but it's not the food itself that makes it good, it's also the person that preps/cooks it. That's something that you won't have at home (unless you are a good cook).

After reading the previous reviews I was excited to try out this place. I do like to support local businesses and small business owners. However, what I got was just \"meh.\" I mean, it wasn't bad. It just was not anything I couldn't make at home in about 10 minutes (minus the roasting time of the turkey and simmering time of the black beans.) Someone at work wanted to try the place so i looked over the reviews here and just told my coworker to grab me a Cajun Chicken sandwich and some sort of healthy side.When my coworker returned I was told that she decided not to get anything but had picked up a Cajun Turkey Sandwich for me and a side of black beans and corn. Since I'm probably the least picky person on earth when it comes to food I was fine with the substitution of turkey instead of chicken.When I opened the to-go container I was honestly shocked. From the reviews I read I was expecting a juicy, tasty sandwich with scratch made condiments and a flavorful mix of black beans and corn. \u00a0However, what I got was simply boiled black beans and corn. No seasoning at all and the beans could have been canned. The sandwich was just a white sesame seed bun with two pieces of iceberg lettuce, one tomato slice, two pickles, and a green onion cut in half and laid in two sticks across the turkey meat. The only thing that came close to making this \"Cajun turkey\" was a splash of Louisiana hot sauce (at least that's what it seemed to be.) There was very little seasoning on the turkey as well. It seemed as though maybe it was kissed with very little salt and pepper and oven roasted. There was no mayo or mustard or condiment of ANY kind on the sandwich except for the splash of hot sauce.The turkey meat was juicy and properly roasted but that was about the only highlight of the entire meal. \u00a0Maybe it was an off day. Maybe other menu items are better. However, based of what I received today, the only reason I would go back is because the meat seemed to be from a turkey breast that was actually roasted in house which puts Split Bread ahead of Wendy's, Hardee's, Sonic, etc (the other fast food places in the area) but unfortunately the service is not fast due to no employees and very few cooking appliances and the rest of the meal was just completely forgettable.I really wanted this to be a place I could get behind and enjoy on days I don't bring lunch to work. Sadly, I will not be back. \u00a0The prices are not bad and the food does seem to be fresh but it's nothing special and could be made at home without any trouble. When I decide to order food from a restaurant, I want it to be something I don't or can't make at home.I wish the nice owner lots of luck but I feel if he plans to be successful he needs to create more memorable dishes and figure out how to get the proper equipment and staff to in order to operate a restaurant efficiently and profitably.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 11 reviews", "date": "2014-03-12"}, {"rating": "1.0", "name": "\nBecky R.\n", "review": "Very disappointing.

Ellendale's is marketed as an up-scale place and, for the occasion, we figured we'd splurge. My formula on this star count has everything to do with price vs. the food. Had it been a little less expensive, I would have given 3 stars.First, the Pros:-Friendly Service-Easy Seating (we went on a Monday night so didn't expect a huge wait but still...)-Eclectic atmosphere. I like that this place is in a large, old house up on a hill. The inside looks very much like a historic home. The rooms are well-painted and they had someone playing piano; it made for a little bit of elegance.-All the food is organic and either grown at the restaurant or locally sourced (big points for that!)The Cons:-First and foremost, the food was just not cooked properly. Looking at the menu, I was a bit surprised things weren't a more expensive given everything was local and organic but, after it arrived, I felt like we paid too much. I had the \"Romeo & Juliet;\" steak medallions with mashed potatoes and greens. I ordered the steak medium rare and, when it came out, the overall appearance of the food was just blah and the steak was very overcooked. The taste of the food was good but I left feeling I could have cooked everything I had there myself and, possibly, better.-My husband's lasagna was about the same. Tasted good but not good enough for the price tag.-The menu was a bit mixed up. I got the vibe they are possibly trying to do too much and don't seem to have a true focus.I hear this place is going to be on Restaurant Impossible and I look forward to trying it again after the revamp. I think they are going in a good direction and, it seems to me, they do care very much about the quality of the food they are serving.

The restaurant \u00a0seems to be a bit dated, it is a somewhat renovated old farmhouse, so expect that Victorian vibe...also expect tables that probably were used by the originals inhabitants of the home 100 years ago...but no need to be snobby, tablecloths masquerade the age well, and still allow the food to be served in the most proper manner.

We decided to try out Ellendale's on a whim, mostly because it was on the east side of town where both we and our friends were at.I was really excited to try Ellendale's after reading their menu online. To my disappointment, the menu on their website was definitely not the same as the one on site. The online menu had several entrees that I was considering (like Mahi Mahi Sliders), but sadly they were nowhere to be found once we arrived. I could understand if one of the review sites or Open Table had the menu wrong, but this was from Ellendale's own website.All of us seemed pretty famished, so we started with the Mediterranean Nachos for an appetizer. Basically, it's crisp pita triangles topped with garlic, hummus, red peppers, pico, goat cheese, pesto, and some sort of balsamic reduction. The pita was rock hard and there wasn't nearly enough of it to finish the toppings. The hummus was creamy and I really enjoyed the balsamic. Something had a spicy kick to it, but only intermittently. The flavors are there, but it's lacking in execution I think.For my entree, I picked what I thought was a safe choice: 14-ounce New York Strip with asparagus and a baked potato. I ordered my steak medium, but it was definitely well done. There wasn't even a hint of pink left. The steak was also a little gristly and tough to chew. I did like the Country Topping (bacon and bleu cheese), which had a nice bite to it.Disappointing food aside, the service was also a bit lacking. We didn't get silverware and napkins until after they brought our appetizer, and even that was only because I asked for it. Our entrees were also very slow to arrive. The restaurant didn't seem horribly busy, so I'm not sure what the hold up was.

More than half of the items on the buffet were picked over, nearly empty and looked very dry. When you're paying over $15.00 for brunch, you expect better quality. We informed the staff that several of the items on the buffet were empty and it took a while for them to refill it.

I had Ellendale's New Years Eve and it was incredible. 2. I did not retaliate against the server he did fine and I tipped 20%. 3. Everything I'm about to tell you is 100% true. So, it all began a couple weeks ago as me and my girlfriend were discussing Valentine's Day plans. She wanted something a little trendier, a little newer, something close to downtown. I told her repeatedly how amazing Ellendale's was on NYE. The place was packed, service excellent and quick, and the steak and baked potato was incredible. So she gives way to recommendation and we book a 7:30 Valentines dinner. It all went down hill from there. We walk through the front door and it reminded me of an overcrowded doctors office. The wait staff and hosts were frazzled noticeably. There must have been 20-25 people crowded in the hallway of this restaurant. All had reservations. I heard rumblings of complaints from other patrons. The vibe of upset customers and frazzled staff members was almost to much to bear so I headed for the bar. Went with a Dos Perros which turned out to be the best purchase of the night. As I'm headed back to the crowded hallway to wait, I don't believe my eyes. IS THIS REAL. A mouse scurries past the hoards of people waiting just feet away from people eating. Unreal. 30 minutes and 2 beers after our 7:30 reservation we are walked upstairs to our seat. I actually looked around for cameras. This had to be a joke. We were seated at a rickety old table covered in cheap table cloth right next to a utility closet. WITH THE DOOR OPEN AND LIGHT ON. Servers were coming in and out of the room to grab cleaning towels. There was also small heater of some sort plugged in and a bucket of ice. These were in my sight line and my girlfriend was directly aligned with the toilet. The bathroom door remained open when not in use (with the light on). So we're literally placed between a utility closet and a bathroom. Both less than 3-5 feet from us. If the mouse didn't kill the romantic vibes, this seating location certainly did. All this and I'm still not to the food. Honestly, I won't drag it on much longer....as bad as the experience was leading up to our food being served, it didn't really matter how good the food was...but, on par with the rest of the night, it was awful. They had a \"special Valentine's menu\" with only like 4 entrees to choose from and they had names such as \"sloppy kiss\", \"hugs and kisses\", and \"she's a V\". With 4 entree options how hard is it to mess up?? Oh and we started with an appetizer sampler plate which wasn't THAT BAD. It was a little cold and the kale chips tasted rubbery and cold but were seasoned nicely? As I feared, with people still waiting downstairs, the food was rushed out to us in no time. At least they're trying to get people seated?? My 6oz steak wasn't horrible but the \"loaded baked potato\" looked and tasted like a microwavable item from Wal mart. My one regret is not taking a picture. The potato I was served was nothing close to the one I was served on New Years Eve. My girlfriend tried her best, but couldn't force down anymore of the bland chicken she ordered. I was especially appalled at her side of asparagus. It was especially bad because I had cooked asparagus the night before that was 5x as good as what was served to us. In closing, I apologize for the length of the review and I do truly hate leaving negative feedback. I've never once left a bad review on any website for any restaurant. As I previously mentioned, the waiter did his job so I tipped appropriately. I wasn't looking to pull the scam of complaining to the manager and getting free food (although the table next to us was offered \"desserts on the house\" to which they declined).

The house is a neat setting and they grow a lot of their produce on site. I sat at the bar and the bartender was super-friendly and attentive. Great service. They had some live music, an acoustic musician which was really nice. Regarding the food, I found it a little hit or miss. I had the Iceberg Wedge salad and it came with crispy onion straws, bacon, sun dried tomatoes and bleu cheese dressing. It was very tasty and I liked the combo of toppings. The proportion was slightly off so I needed to ask for more onion straws. Next I had the bruschetta. In my experience, bruschetta is always a gamble. They make their bread in house and then make the crostini from that and the texture of the bread was very good. My problem was the bread was soaked in the balsamic vinaigrette. You only need the slightest hint of balsamic, so a strong a flavor it is. There was basil ice cream to cleanse the palate, which was tasty, but it more like rescued my palate from the balsamic overkill. Again, proportions were off.Lastly, I had the Tiramisu. Be forewarned -- this is nothing like tiramisu. It was a real disappointment and I should have sent it back but I was so exhausted from my day I just tried to eat part of it. It was basically a slab of cream cheese and I do mean a slab, with some shredded coconut sprinkled on top, a few bits of pineapple thrown in, and some dry cake. Again the problem was with proportion. A ridiculous amount of cream cheese to all the other ingredients. Also, you need mascarpone to make tiramisu. When I heard it was all cream cheese, I was a bit confused, but decided to try it thinking maybe it was creamy like cheesecake, but no, it was literally like they unwrapped a package of cream cheese and threw it on a plate. I still get a bit queasy thinking of it. The ambiance is for the older crowd. Meaning on a Friday night there were a lot of elderly people. I was just looking for a quiet dinner, but overall not that impressed and if I'm in Nashville I wouldn't return. Service was great though, they just need to re-work the food.

It all looked good and we went there based on a review in our hotel magazine. I also liked the fact that it was a local business wanting to use as many local products as possible. The setting being in an old house as well also helped make our deicison.We arrived and had to wait a few moments to be seated, this was expected being New Years Eve, so it was no big deal. There was a nice dark room to sit near the bar which was very relaxing. The staff asked us if we wanted to drinks and that we would be seated shortly. No problems here.When we were seated, we were enjoying a local musician at the piano singing everything from Billy Joel to Elton John to basically everything on the Classic Rock station. She was enjoyable for the evening and very welcoming to all the patrons and took requests.Our server surprised us from behind as our seats were put in a way to face the stage. He went over the menu with us and we ordered our appetizers and dinner. My wife started with a salad. It was decent but nothing over the top. I ordered the rabbit pate and found it pleasant. For dinner, my wife order the half chicken. It looked good, but it was rather tasteless. The barley on the side was tasteless as well. I ordered the advertised New York Strip medium rare, which turned out to be a rib eye instead according to our server. That sparked my interest even more since I like that cut better. The steak came out and was undercooked. The server even asked me to check while he brought it to the table. Hmmmm.... It was still rather rare and in about five minutes he brought it back and it was cooked to my liking. After a few bites, one would expect a little fat here and there, but when each piece turned out to be fatty and stringy, I was getting annoyed. On top of all this, the steak was way too thick to be the rib eye's that I am accustomed to. I am almost thinking it was a chuck steak bought in bulk for New Years made to look like something else. I sent back the steak and decided to order the pork chop instead. The pork chop probably faired much worse than it actually was as my appetite was waning. The side of mash potatoes was decent but by that time I was done.I felt that all the servers were running around frantically for no reason. My wife and I both have worked in the restaurant business so I want to make it clear that I am not just complaining. They were far from understaffed but could not seem to accomodate their tables in a timely manner. At many times, I found servers hiding in the bathroom hallway or servers not even present and rarely coming out of the kitchen area. I cannot speak for other tables, but for the few around us, there were not many smiles based on the service and the food. If something was happening in the kitchen, it was very obvious on the faces and personalities of the servers.At the end of the night, our server tried to make nice with us and tried to make conversation over my wife's South American name. It did not help his tip at all. I think he knew we were upset with his service as well as the food.All in all, the best part of the evening was actually the OK lounge act the restaurant offered. She made the rounds to each table and wished us all a Happy New Year. What bothered me even more was that the restaurant was not overcrowded. There were empty tables scattered throughout and still the servers were unable to perform their jobs properly. The kitchen had a smaller menu for the holiday and still they were not able to make quality food for the price we were paying. The restaurant must have known what the dinner service was going to be like with the reservation book as well as the usual walk-ins.This restaurant we will definetly overlook the next time we are in town to visit.", "location": "\nKansas City, MO\n", "exp": " 63 reviews", "date": "2012-01-02"}, {"rating": "2.0", "name": "\ngreg p.\n", "review": "While this normally is a great place to go, today wwas NOT!

You must be adventurous to come here and enjoy it for your money's worth though. If you are just getting regular cuts of meat like beef and chicken, I don't think this place is worth the price for you.So the basic concept is a buffet where you serve yourself sides and put up a little marker to show you're ready for the meats. Everything is all you can eat.Our server was very nice and even though she's gone through the explanation spiel a million times I'm sure, she was very warm and took time to explain everything. They did a good job of incorporating Brazilian things into the menu--each table gets a starter of 3 appetizers that are all Brazilian themed: fried polenta, fried banana, and a cheese popover. I also ordered a Caipirinha, because it's the only Brazilian drink I know! I got mine with strawberry and coconut, and it has big chunks of fruit in it. It was very tasty!They have an amazing bar of sides. You serve yourself the sides, and then the meat is brought to you by servers. There were so many delightful salads to choose from. My favorite was the roasted coconut salad, it was like a coconut cole slaw! They had couscous salad, quinoa salad, kale salad, and tons of other sides to choose from. They had macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, baked ziti, and a few other non-salad sides. This sides bar is well stocked and has tons of choices--probably 20 different items I woulds say. I could have filled up on this alone.Service was rapid! When we turned our marker over for more meat, they would arrive one after the other! We had to quickly flip the marker to stop them, because they would just rapid-fire offer us a new meat before we could even take a knife to what was on our plate already. It was great! And all the gentlemen carrying the meat skewers were very nice and chit-chatted with us.Meats we tried: Japanese pork, lamb, some kind of white fish (forgot what is was!), sweet and sour chicken, some other kind of chicken, a few different cuts of beef, Rocky Mountain Oysters (Google it...), Yak meatballs, Rattlesnake sausage, Elk sausage... I think that's it?I love the yak, the \"oysters,\" rattlesnake, elk, and the rare beef. The fish was good, but I prefer a whole fish to just a slice :P As for me, yes there were a few cuts and types of meat I didn't like, such as the lamb (it was awful, but I've never had lamb before either). But that didn't detract form the experience at all, since I came prepared for an adventure. Overall, I really enjoyed the food. I do feel it is a tad overpriced at $35 a plate, but I can see how having all those exotic meats can raise the price up.

His name was Will. He rocks! Our gauchos were great, too. Everyone who approached our table with food was very informative and hospitable.So why only 3 stars?We had a reservation. We showed up several minutes before our reserved time. The waiting area was packed. I checked in and was told our table would be ready in a couple minutes. Those without reservations were told it would be an hour. Believe me, I was so glad I made our reservation! While waiting, I overheard a couple parties talk about how they had been waiting for about 30 minutes...and they had reservations, too! We all continued to wait. One person (with a reservation...and at the same time as ours) asked the hostess how much longer till he would be seated. She said that he was next.But he wasn't.Two other parties were seated before he was.A couple next to me (with a reservation) asked the hostess when they would be seated. They had been waiting nearly an hour, and their reservation was before mine!They were seated immediately.After 40 minutes of waiting (and being courteous to the diners with reservations who had been waiting longer than us), my husband finally approached the hostess. She told him we were next.Ten minutes and 3 other parties later (diners without reservations), we were finally seated. Nearly one hour after we checked in. People who walked in without a reservation after us were seated before us!So, yes, make a reservation before you show up.

I think a lot of the pretty positive reviews may be from less experienced n00bs.Meats- were pretty meh, and that's generous. Cuts were always thin and overcooked, there was almost no outside pieces available when they brought it around, the Gauchos need a little training in how to properly slice the meat (as this as possible for most cuts etc). They came around sporadically and we often went 5 or more minutes with no meat being offered. They also loaded up on like wine marinated chicken and other nonsense meats no one wants but were super light on picanha.Sides- we only got brought sides once at the beginning. They were all cold. The mashed potatoes couldn't have been more than like 3 ounces for a table full of people. The cheesey poofs were very flat and de-poofed as well as cold. They were never refilled. Salad Bar- we went for lunch and got there at like noon which should be busy time but the place was pretty empty. The hot sides had all very clearly been sitting their untouched for quite some time and had a thick skin on them- super appealing. Service- as discussed under meats not great. Also there is valet parking for like 10 dollars since its impossible to park on the street anywhere nearby. The valet parked our car about 10 feet from the valet stand.

I was concerned we would not get the whole experience, but was happily wronged. The Hostess was so nice when I called THAT day for reservations--right before Church--what was I thinking? \u00a0God was watching me...saying get in here and we will let you out after. Valet was 7 dollars. I was a little surprised no one warned me here. Shame on you Yelpers. Now you know! Please feel free to tip on my paypal account for these pearls. JOKE BIG JOKE. \u00a0So they take my car we are off. Hostess was again as sweet as she was 1 hour previously and I asked to sit near the grill. Another Yelper told me this. No Grill seating but next to salad bar. Yeah OK let's see what happens. Well we had 2 not 1 waiters in about 5 minutes giving us the 411. I was not in the mood for a beverage, but friends had the specialty Cipriahana--spelling but you know what I mean the rum and lime drink and the soda- Antartica which tasted like a sweet Sierra Mist with Orange. Hands down, I liked the water. Salad bar had tons of things, but no Ranch or Blue Cheese Dressing. Had Caesar and Italian and lots of different vinegretts so that was fine. It was Brunch so there were eggs and bacon and different casseroles and rice and whipped with cream mashed potatoes. How many WW points I did not bother to add up. Lots of different salads and black beans and there were rolls and banana bread. They had the largest hearts of Palm I have ever seen. We had a little very little of most things, but did not want to fill up. When we turned the green thing, my friends said it felt the swarmed. Swarm Swarm Swarm like on Seinfeld at the bookstore episode. The meats were steak, sirloin, skirt and 2 others, Not Filet- I did not care, but heard some random guy ask. Well really, we eat Filet a lot, the meats compared to Filet were top notch. Also a few types of Chicken and Sweet and Spicy. Also a white fish and Chicken hearts which reminded me of Large Almonds with a intense Chicken Flavor. There was some Pork around and some Lamb but truly we did NOT gorge. I know that people say to do that, but really the worst feeling in the world is that full feeling. \u00a0We also had a birthday but I requested to opt of out of the singing. They do a wonderful Birthday song, but really we did not need that. Some friends had another drink, and we asked for the dessert menu. No such thing, they bring the cart. Would have liked for someone to try the Passion Fruit Mousse, but only the Flan and the Chocolate wonder were chosen Chocolate thing was really really sweet and the Flan was thicker. The Creme Brullee has Orange liguor in it. Oh the apps like the rest of the Yelpers are stating are 3. Fried and bread. Fried banana app, very very very banana tasty, Polenta \"fries\" and then the Cheese puffs. Again we waited for the main course. Oh they give you a drink menu only. The rest is salad bar and the gauchos. Also there was this dreamy guy named Michelle. One of the Gauchos. Could listen to his voice at anytime. He was quite helpful. All our servers were helpful.

I think I should preface by saying I'm not a huge meat eater/lover even though I do eat it and enjoy being a carnivore on occasion. So if you are a meat head and love it... maybe I'm not your best review to read. However, I will continue with that disclaimer! This was my first time ever being at a Brazilian steakhouse, but I knew the standard; price fix menu and unlimited supply of food. To be honest, I have never had a desire to eat at one of these restaurants, but as it was someone's birthday I came along for dinner. There are two options; full rodizio with unlimited meat and salad bar for $32.99 or salad bar only for $18.99. Multiple people have told me this is a great deal as most Brazilian Steakhouses are around $50 per person. After taking a look at the salad bar and seeing all of the food available, I went with the salad bar only and it was PLENTY of food. I enjoyed it; they offered hot dishes and cold ones as well with some hits and misses, but overall pretty decent. I snuck a bite or two of meat from my boyfriend's plate and it was tasty, but I didn't find myself upset that I missed out on it to be honest... some feedback from the table who did partake in the meat selections said that there were some cuts of meat that were amazing, others were a bit tough. They also are pretty good about cutting off big pieces if you want that. I did get a bit frustrated having to say \"no thanks\" over and over again to the gauchos who were bringing by meat. It was better once we told our server that I was only eating the salad bar, but I still had to say \"no thanks\" again and again. One of them it must have been his first day because he didn't have hardly ANY muscle in cutting the meat and had some difficulty getting pieces off. So you see my dilemma... $18.99 is a bit steep in my opinion for a salad/hot bar only, but it was good. It's nice to have the option to opt out of the full experience if you are trying to save some money or have dietary restrictions. I think vegans are a bit screwed....just don't come here if you are vegan period! I keep going back and forth between 3 and 4 stars but I think I have to go with my gut and give them a 3..

Boy was I wrong! Between me (I was dining alone) and one other party of six we had the place to ourselves and the service was great! Fast, attentive, asked me exactly what I wanted and brought it right out to me (they don't try to fill you up on the less expensive meats like other places)The salad bar was not as fancy or exotic as other brazilian steakhouses but they had a hot bar that had more choices than any place I've been before. ok best part of the whole thing -- THE TOP SIRLOIN. Simply magnificent! Perfect flavor, tendy, juicy, melts in your mouth! Totally makes up for the fact that filet mignon is not one of the cuts here, because man oh man that top sirloin is better than the best filet you could ever imagine.The second best part is the delectible pineappple they bring around --- it's glazed and grilled over the flame just like all the other meats making it sweet, juicy, and succulent. (see photos!)The only negative I have to say is that the cheesy bread was a little hard, like it wasn't fresh. Probably because it was the end of the night.

If you guessed bacon, you would be right.Since living in salt lake city, the rodizio grill has been my favorite restaurant. I went to it for the first time in 1999, right before I went to live in Rio de Janeiro. The rodizio grill is a great representation of a traditional Brazilian Churrascaria and is my favorite place to go to make me feel like I'm in Brazil again . I would also say that the Nashville installment is even better than the one in Utah.Now, back to bacon. When I went in January it was Bacon month, and there were several more of the meats that hat been paired with bacon. Also, at the salad bar there were several different local bacons for you to try. The jalape\u00f1o bacon was especially good. If that weren't enough, the pao de queijo also had bits of bacon in it. When we were offered refills on the delicious little cheese breads, we were given both the original version and some more of the bacon ones. They came right out of the oven, and were perfect. The rodizio of meats brought many different varieties. They seemed to have the perfect combinations of degrees of wellness. My wife was able to get the well done pieces she wanted and I could get the more medium rare pieces. Most of our choices were also the \"first cut\" pieces, which are the best. They are the ones who've been exposed directly to the fire and salted directly. I'll still say that the picanha is my favorite. The staff was great and brought us the few meats we wanted to try again at the end of our meal. I want to say Anna was our server's name and she did a great job.For the first time, we also got desert. The brigadeiro cake was an enormous portion that we shared and still only got half way through.

The valet was ridiculous, the car was never parked in one spot it was parked on the street and moved at least 5 times, if a spot opened up further up the road they would move every car behind it forward so the valets wouldn't have to parallel park. I Might as well have just payed somebody to circle the block in it till we were done eating.(2) The Appetizer. when the appetizers came they only brought 3 pieces of 3 different items for a table of 16 people, the server was apologetic and said she would bring more out, by the time more came I was already done eating the dinner part. (3) Meats. we were told we would we have choice of 12 meats, only 7 meats came to our table with a glazed pineapple as one of the meat choices, the meat cuts were small 1 bite per cut, it was also way undercooked beyond Rare, I assume that this contributed to the reason why everybody at our table was throwing up or getting diarrhea for the rest the night, I started getting sick before I left I had to walkout and find a place on the street to throw up because the bathrooms were full and I couldn't wait in the long line. \u00a0(4) Price. The waitress said the price for all you can eat was $34.00, when I asked for the check the previously nice attitude of our waitress flipped, She first told me she would get it when she had time in a tone of voice as if It was a major inconvenience I then explained to her that the food was making me sick and if she didn't bring my check I was leaving without paying she then came back very quick with the check. When the bill came she added a $7 Service charge I assume this was because I asked for my check before she was ready to give it to me.

My conclusion is 2/5 stars and this is why: Pros: they have a magnificent salad bar with a variety of foods. Our actual server was very nice and attentive. Also, the choices of meat were decent. Cons: their staff is extremely inexperienced and rude, the dining was rushed, the meat was not cooked to temperature, and no variety of lamb. In dealing with staff, their servers didn't ask about how we would like the temperature of the meat. When I asked to have something medium rare, it was given well done or rare. In cutting the meat, the staff had virtually no idea how to properly hold a steak knife and slice the appropriate width of meat. The meat either came too thin that it wouldn't be a slice, or it would be so thick that it was tough to slice through it. Out of our table of 6, they asked 2 people whether they would like the meat. The other 4 were not at all acknowledged. On top of that, when my friend said he wanted a piece, one slice was cut for me, then the server left in a rush bc \"others requested\" that cut of meat. Their staff also pushed through plates, and knocked over forks to sit the meat on the table for cutting. Rather than staying around the empty spots in the table, they chose to squeeze through couples and \"make room\" on the table to cut. After our forks were knocked over, there was no apology and they were quick to leave. I requested back 2 cuts of meat, and only 1 was brought back. The one that was brought back was not cooked to the approximate temperature that I requested, and the staff seemed annoyed that I asked for a choice of meat to come back. Also, The cheese bread was fairly burned and stale. I can genuinely say, I'm extremely disappointed and will never come here again. Maybe because Houston has so much competition, they're precise and detailed in the dining experience. I felt like I was at a fast food Resturant dining here and I did not feel welcomed nor enjoy the dinner.

To order the meat, you flip the wooden peg to GREEN. To stop, flip to RED. To order desert, flip it horizontally so the YELLOW faces up. Delicious grilled meat runs from beef, lamb, chicken, pork, to fish. The sweet and sour chicken is a must! It was my favorite out of all the 10+ meats I tried. Grilled pineapple and grilled tomato with parmesan cheese are also available if you want to get away from the meat a little bit. The salad bar was pretty amazing. There were so many types of salad, but my favorite was the Quinoa salad. The good thing about this place is they offer variety of Gluten Free salads. For drinks, I had the Hot Sunset (?). My friends had the Caipirinha (Brazilian classic cocktail) and something else on the list Gabriella recommended. They all were very good but not to point that made me drunk. We had the Flan and Orange Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. They both were delicious and not too sweet. Customer service was EXCELLENT. As soon as we turned the wooden peg to green, every 10 seconds there was a Passadores (Good-looking ones *cough*) came to cut us meat. The waitress was also very attentive. We asked for hot sauce and they had Siracha sauce for us (Siracha at a Brazilian restaurant!!). They weren't being cheap on the sauce either and gave us a full cup of it. We didn't need to make reservations on a Monday night, however I recommend to make one if you plan to go on weekend. This place can get crowded pretty quickly. They also offered valet parking here ($7 on weekdays, $10 on weekend) but we decided to park a little farther. After eating all of those delicious food, a long walk was much needed...For the ladies, I recommend you wear a dress or something comfortable (you'll thank me later).Check out this place, y'all.

I love the concept of Brazilian steakhouse with unlimited meat and have been to Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil many times. However Rodizio is nowhere near those places. The prices at Rodizio are slightly lower but quality is nowhere near the other Brazilian steakhouses i have been to. There is absolutely nothing I like about this place. The meat quality, the service, and the distribution of meat were all poor. The restaurant's layout is just inefficient. I won't even talk about the salad bar because this is a stake restaurant but if I had to, it would be another negative for the restaurant.The Meat: Every cut, and I will admit there were not many, I tried was dry and absolutely tasteless. The guys delivering the meat have no idea what they are doing. I kept asking for medium pieces but they would serve me pieces that was really well done or rare. Distribution of Meat: This was a complete disaster as we were seated near the bar area which is far from the action. We told our server several times that we were not getting any meat and he assured us that we will send someone over. Nothing changed. To be fair, the brown sugar glazed pineapple came to our table several times but i did not even bother trying it. I went to Rodizio for meat not fruits. At some point we were tired, asked for our check and left the place with some of us being still hungry. Yes, we were still hungry because we could not eat anything. How is it even possible to leave a Brazilian steakhouse hungry after paying $100+ for two. This is a first for me. Those who have visited a good Brazilian steakhouse would understand me here. The Service: Our server was incompetent. Him being incompetent was partially due to the fact that he was assigned to wait more tables than he could handle. But the result for us was an extremely poor service. Our drinks came late (he himself told us he forgot about our drinks). I asked for salt at the beginning of our dinner and he brought the salt right before we were leaving. I had the first couple of slices of meat in my salad plate as he was not around to serve us some clean plates. When I told him that we were not getting any meat, he asked me whether I was serious. I just pointed to the five empty plates sitting in front of us and he felt my frustration but did not do anything about this.Overall, we had a very bad experience at Rodizio and I will not go back. Not even to give it a second chance or even if it was for free. Another reviewer here on Yelp said \"Go to Rodizio, the feast is awaiting you\" ..

I was NOT disappointed. Rodizio is every bit as good down to the service, meats, salad bar, and even atmosphere. My boyfriend and I had a reservation for 5:30 on a Sunday. We were seated immediately and greeted by Marie, our friendly waitress. She promptly brought over the appetizers (which are included with the price of your meal) of banana fritas (chunks of banana fried with cinnamon-YUM), polenta fries-YUM, and Brazillian cheese bread-YUM! All appetizers are all you can eat. After we sampled all of those we made our way over to the salad bar. They had a huge assortment of crisp veggies to top your lettuce and also had quite a few \"ready made\" salads like Caesar and a delicious BLT salad. Also included were things like potato salad, chicken salad, mozzarella salad, and fruit salad. I believe some of their salad options change based on seasonal items. The \"hot dish\" portion of the salad bar had things like creamy mashed potatoes, different kinds of rices, sauteed collard greens with bacon, grilled vegetables, pasta alfredo, and chicken and beef stroganoff. Everything we tried was delicious! It is an option to purchase just the salad bar and forgo the meat experience and I will definitely say you would be absolutely pleased and full just off the salad bar alone if meat is not your thing. On to the best part- the meats. The Gauchos have 17 different offerings. Out of 17 we sampled maybe 10. I almost feel like I needed a list on the table to mark off everything I tried. My favorites were the Picanha, the bacon wrapped turkey, the sweet and spicy chicken, the marinated chicken, the sausage, the bacon wrapped parmesan pork, marinated pork loin, and the ham. I feel full after just writing that! The oooonly thing I was slightly disappointed with was the Brazilian Brisket. We heard the word \"brisket\" and was like \"Omg. Get that over here!\" Then we discovered that apparently Brazilian Brisket is the same thing as roast. It was served from a bowl with potatoes and carrots and it actually tasted fine but I am not a fan of roast due to terrible childhood roast memories. Ha. (Don't ask) We were thinking it was going to be like BBQ brisket but we were wrong. Oh well.During the course of our meal we had 2 bottles of wine and we got the cheesecake to go.

The salad bar was OK, there was a good selection, and seemed fresh. We also had to share the green, red thing they put on the table. \u00a0It didn't make sense, since the 4 of us that shared it ate at different pace, and liked our meats completely different cooked, which seemed a big challenged for them to provide a well done steak. I preferred mine medium rare but the other people at my table did not, so they probably tried 2 steaks, since all of them were cooked the same way. I was so sad to be disappointed, the word of mouth of this place was amazing, a couple of friends raved about it! If you are in downtown and want a heavy meal before going bar hopping this might be your place, but if not \u00a0then is NOT worth it after parking and the small rotations, I would have been more satisfied with a good piece of meat, instead of OK, small pieces.

She was very sweet and you could tell she was on top of things. We started off with very nice appetizers of polenta fried and very crisp on the outside with soft middle as well as fried plantains. All were very good. The salad bar was very nice and we tried a tasting of each item. Then we got started with the third course which was the meat. I have been to various Churrascuria's in Queretaro Mexico that were top notch and this one had different varieties of chicken along with sausage, lamb, beef and pork. They do not serve tenderloin but for the price of $68.00 for two people that is not bad at all. In Mexico the pineapples were coated in cinnamon and roasted which were out of this world.

He is a big meat lover and Rodizio did not disappoint! I read a few reviews on Yelp where people complained that the meat did not come around fast enough. We had quite the opposite experience- We were presented with a different meat option at our table every 1-2 minutes. Things moved along so quickly that I could hardly finish a bite before saying \"yes\" to another selection (not complaining). We were extremely pleased with the variety as well- anything from fish to chicken hearts to sirloin. I think in all we counted 13 different options, and I'm not even positive we sampled all there was to sample.I was most impressed by the salad bar. It was a great mix of both hot and cold items and offered a good amount of things I had never tried before. Actually if I go back to this restaurant, I will likely only get the salad bar instead of the full Rodizio- not because I didn't enjoy the meats but because there was so much on the salad bar I didn't get to try because I got too full. My only complaint about the evening is that it was not made clear to us at all that dessert was an additional cost (and I'll take the blame for not doing my research online beforehand). However, were just casually told to let our server know when we were ready for dessert, leading us to think it was included with the full Rodizio. My husband and I both ordered desserts, which were also very good, but we were so full that we each only had 3 bites of it before pushing it to the side. Needless to say I was a little miffed when I had an additional $14 tacked on my bill for something we barely touched. Live and learn. On a positive note, aside from this miscommunication, our service was outstanding! I never had to ask for a clean plate or a drink refill. Overall I am giving the experience a 4. Was it the best food you can find in Nashville? No. But if you're looking for a place that's different with a good atmosphere, vast variety, and quality food, this will absolutely meet your standards.

Most of the meats were tasty and presented well. The salad bar is nothing to rave about. Basically an overgrown Ruby Tuesday bar. But, who really cares?

The guy serving the brisket got a little perturbed when I stopped him from pouring any more brisket juice on our party from his serving spoon. Our primary server, while a very polite young man, was never shown how to cut the foil on a bottle of wine or to twist the bottle at the end of the pour. Wine on table and mangled bottle = not cool.

We'd heard lots of great things about it both online and from friends and co-workers. When I saw that they served all you can eat meat, I made our reservation! When we arrived, we took advantage of their valet parking service ($7) and went straight in and to our seats. Luckily, we were right by the window and got to people watch as we ate. We were also right by the spacious bar which happened to be empty so I got to sneak a few peeks at the football game on the two TVs they had going. The whole place was decorated nicely and had dark but not too dark lighting, which I personally really like. Our waitress was very informative, nice, and helpful, giving us plenty of information since we'd never been there before. The appetizers we were served consisted of a cinnamon banana treat which was different and also a cheese puff thingy and polenta with parmesan. We liked the cheese the best. The salad bar was fantastic! Could have easily made a meal off of just that. Very wide variety of not so ordinary salads (my favorite was the shrimp pasta and my wife liked the spicy chicken). They also had some cheeses, breads, and meat (bacon, pastrami) as well as some soups, vegetables, and rice dishes. I lost count of how many types of meat we were served but we enjoyed all of them except maybe the chicken hearts which we really only tried to say we'd done it. My favorite was the garlic steak and she loved the garlic chicken. After we stuffed ourselves to the max, we decided to have dessert ANYWAY. Several options were available but we chose a sweet pastry with some ice cream and caramel drizzled on it. Again, I missed the name but it was very rich and delicious. We were very impressed with the atmosphere, quality of food, and very good service. We ended up spending right around $100 for the two of us but we did have a couple of drinks.

Don't get me wrong, the staff wasn't necessarily rude (although they did bypass our table multiple times, only to return with either no meat or a poor cut), the problem was in their not knowing how to properly cut and serve the meat. The picanha, which is supposed to be cut so as to have a layer of fat on top, was being cut from the side with the fat being left off, which left half of what makes picanha so tasty missing from your plate. And to make matters worse, we were never once asked how we liked our meat cooked. All in all, it could have been worse, but then again it could have been much, much better. We won't be going back.

The rotation of meats was good and included chicken, spicy chicken, white fish,steaks (3 kinds), pork loin, and lamb. You could select your specific wellness (rare to well) for each cut, but the rare cuts were sometimes hard to find. The serving staff did attempt to please, and continued to bring back additional cuts. While tasty, the meats lacked depth and full flavor. That being said, for the inclusive price of $32.95/pp for salad, appetizer and meat selection the offering was a great value. The waiters, serving staff and cooks were very nice and attentive. I would return, but ask that the kitchen add some depth to the seasonings and possibly marinate some of the cuts.

This is the only place where I can routinely get a goat curry wrapped in a roti or some oxtail, so for that reason alone, I'd probably give it a pass.But the problem with places that feature food that reminds me of my childhood is that I'm going to have a pretty high bar set and I can't honestly say that Jamaicaway is hitting that bar. While I appreciate how tender they get their goat, I sometimes feel like the spicing is off in the curry base, and if you're going to get the goat roti (which is essentially like a big burrito filled with goat curry), it would be nice to only have boneless meat in there, otherwise you are in for a nasty surprise. My other qualm is with the callalloo, which they make using turnip and other various greens, which is just not the way it's meant to be done. Callalloo is a plant that is very similar to spinach and while you can make it with other greens, it won't officially be callalloo in my book if you do so. Additionally, I hate that they use all the parts of the greens they do use, meaning that you get bunches of undigestible and unplatable fibrous bits that are a bit like chewing bamboo. Not pleasant at all.Also, I don't want to fault Jamaicaway on being successful, but I think it is fair to say that if you come during the lunch hour, this place will be busy and service will suffer for it. Even though it's cafeteria style, the line always seems to stall, especially as I always seem to wind up behind someone who is ordering 5 or 6 meals to go. I do find the hours pretty inconvenient as well, as this is yet another one of those Nashville restaurants that only seems to be open for lunch or an extremely early dinner. I also think that the food is a little bit pricey, personally. Maybe if their goat roti were the best I'd ever had I could see spending $11 on it, but I've had better for a fraction of that price. The portions are generous, but I generally find that I don't want to eat my entire meal because the flavor just doesn't have the proper refinement.I appreciate that Jamaicaway is filling a niche here in Nashville, and for that I give it some extra points, but whenever I go, I can't help but wish it were better.

We were craving Thai food so we thought about hitting up Thai Taste. We would be in the area & we always enjoyed it. I looked to see their hours, recently they'd have odd hours. I checked the website & found they'd actually closed about a year & a half ago! It looks like a new Thai place has opened up in it's place, Thai Ville. We decided to give it a try. We stopped in around noon on Sunday & there was one couple at a different table. Not very busy, but that didn't detour us, I mean it's only been open for about 4 months by my calculations. We were greeted warmly & sat at a table & our drink order was taken. If you'd been to Thai Taste, the interior will be very familiar. They haven't change much. It's a nicely appointed restaurant for the age of the building. As we skimmed the menu (all with pictures), the owner stopped by & introduced himself & told us what dishes were his favorite & how this food is different than the other Thai places in Nashville. We decided on the crab Rangoon as an appetizer, I ordered the Pad Kee Mao & Phillip ordered some kind of pork dish. They've got a lunch & dinner price. There's about two dollars in price difference on the items. I told the server I wanted the lunch portion, seeing as it was lunchtime & I wasn't wanting a huge plate of food. She told us that on the weekends is only dinner portions. I thought that was a little odd but I figured we be getting a huge plate of food. The crab Rangoon came soon after. You can really tell they care about presentation here. They use a lot of flowers carved out of carrots & other vegetables. The crab Rangoon was okay. The won tong paper was really thick so it was kind of hard to bite into. I like it when the paper is more delicate & inside crab stuff is fluffy. The food arrived after we were done with the crab Rangoon. The \"dinner\" portion we got looked more like a lunch portion. I think the lunch/dinner portion on the weekend is probably just to make a few extra bucks. The menu didn't have anything on it about no lunch options on the weekend, however on the website, the new menu says dinner is from 11am-9pm on Saturday & Sunday. I enjoyed the Pad Kee Mao. The noodles were cooked well & the chicken was seasoned. I asked for spicy but it wasn't very spicy so we got the 3 little containers of spices. The bell peppers were a little soft for me. Overall I enjoyed the meal.

We liked the location as it was close to our home and the food was always good. The problem was Thai Taste would often be closed and never seemed to keep steady hours and then it closed. We were very happy to see that new owners took over the location. It is now called Thai Ville and we recently visited the new restaurant. We were greeted by a very polite server who told us about his family moving here from Bangkok and how long they had been open. From the first bite, we knew we had found a winner. We ordered a variety of dishes to try as many items as we could. We started with Thai tea and it was creamy and the tea flavor was perfect. Sometimes the Thai tea can be harsh or taste too strong. This was excellent. I ordered Tom Yum with shrimp and my wife ordered Miso Soup. The Tom Yum broth was so flavorful and rich. I can't remember a better experience with Tom Yum. It's usually either too spicy hot or too salty but this was just perfect. The Miso was also very rich and perfectly seasoned. I ordered Chicken Satay and they generous portion was cooked exactly how I like it and the peanut sauce was excellent. The peanut sauce had to be homemade. My wife ordered tiger tears salad and it was very flavorful the seasoning was a great combination of sweet and savory. I ordered Red Curry with shrimp. Red Curry is one of my go-to's at Thai restaurants so I've had many. The curry in this one was so amazing that I found myself desperately trying to get the last drop of the curry out of the serving bowl.

I asked for the classic 'beef and cheese' and they didn't do that. \u00a0I was a little disappointed about that. BUT - little did I know, I was about to have one of THE BEST eating experiences. I am a very picky eater, so the bartender let me have them made however I wanted. I got 3 of the Fried chicken, added cheese and got the INCREDIBLE lime sauce on the side, since I wasn't sure if I'd like it or not. Then, I got 3 of the pulled pork, with BBQ sauce, added cheese. I also got a lemonade. My total was $26.76. I thought that was really expensive... But thought, it had to be good for that price. So, I open up the box and dug in. Took my first bite of the BBQ pulled pork and I was almost in shock how delicious this was. I couldn't tell you how many times I made the - \"mmmmm\" noise. I'm not even kidding. The meat was definitely high quality, no doubt! It was juicy, tender, everything about it was good. I then tried the fried chicken, I put a little bit of the lime sauce on, took a bite, WOW. \"mmmmm\" I ate two of the chicken tacos and one of the pork tacos. I REALLY wanted more of the pork, but half of the order was for my special friend. That REALLY felt like a sacrifice! Lol. Not even kidding. I picked him up from work and started handing him tacos as he was driving. His reaction was the EXACT same as mine! It was so funny. He did the whole \"mmmmm\" thing serveral times while stuffing his face, just how I did. He said a couple times how fantastic it was.

We wanted Mexican, so Chuy's was a close option. The wait was only 10 minutes and we were seated. We were brought chips and salsa, plus a creamy sauce that we were told was their house made creamy jalape\u00f1o sauce. The chips were excellent and that creamy sauce was amazing! We all preferred it to salsa. Our chips and sauce were refilled multiple times over the course of the meal and two of us even used that sauce as an extra flavor on our meals. The menu is large and it was easy for me to find something as a vegetarian. I ordered the tex-mex salad combo, which included a large dinner salad and a choice of several smaller menu items. I chose a mini- burrito, which was not mini at all, but was compared to their menu burrito (12\" long!). I got the bean and cheese, and it came with my choice of sauce over it - I got queso. Our food came out quickly and we dug in. It was yummy! Homemade sauces, fresh ingredient, and flavorful. My burrito was maybe a bit too heavy on the salt but still good. The salad was fresh and the dressing was great. Adding some of that jalapeno sauce to both enhanced the flavors too. My dining companions ordered a steak burrito and fajitas, and both loved them. The portions were too big for any of us to finish... or maybe that was the 3 baskets of chips we consumed. But I digress..So we came back for a happy hour. Their happy hour rocks. House margaritas for $4.25, and a free nacho bar. The nacho bar has their yummy queso, salsa, jalapeno sauce and ground beef. All with unlimited chips. It was like a meal. Price for 4 alcoholic drinks and 1 virgin drink was $23. We were staying at the Opryland resort, where it cost $26 at a bar for one wine and one cocktail.

After all of that, I had no confidence whatsoever in what would actually come out of the kitchen. Surprisingly, everything was correct.The beans were nice and mushy, but didn't really have much flavor. The rice was decently spicy. Although it looked a bit dry, it was actually quite nice. My chile relleno had a really good batter. The thick pepper had a nice flavor to it, and the creamy jalapeno ranch was a nice addition.

After ordering drinks and loading up our nachos, we we're already pretty satisfied, and opted to share the waiter-recommended chicken fajitas.

It was a 2 hour wait, but we asked, and they serve full menu at the main and outdoor bars, so we just went and made some room for ourselves in the outside portion of the bar. If you aren't in a large party, and you don't have kids with you, then sitting at the bar is a great way to bypass a long, long wait.We had our food in less than 20 minutes after ordering. I've been to Chuy's before, and am pretty satisfied with the general spiciness (pretty spicy) and the flavors they bring to their food. From the chips and salsa to the enchiladas, they make it all in house, and it tastes really good. If you have dietary restrictions (vegan/no dairy/gluten free) they seem pretty willing to work for you. They will fry up your own serving of chips in a separate pan of oil just to make sure no wheat flour gets into them if you ask. They will make a separate batch of meat without the gluten/dairy containing seasoning they would otherwise use.Ask for a bowl of creamy jalapeno sauce when they bring out the chips and salsa. It is free and it is wonderful. Not at all low-fat, though. My only criticism about the food is that they don't really do enough to differentiate the menu items. You would be hard pressed to identify all of the sauces they put on a typical plate, and they can start to run together. We have talked with a manager a couple of times, and feel confident in their food prep ethics. They were out of shredded chicken, and it was going to be a couple of hours to get some more ready...because it takes a couple of hours to cut up a chicken, cook it, take it off the bone, shred it, and then cook it again. I would much rather eat that kind of food.The guy who said \"Taco Bell is better most times\" has apparently not been to Taco Bell recently (since the `80s?). Or maybe has a personal beef against Chuy's for some unstated reason. It's certainly not 1-star food. I got a large plate of food, and it had zero fried items (other than the fresh chips I was eating at the time). Yes, there are more authentic (and honestly, better) Mexican restaurants on Nolensville Rd. If we're going to compare everyone to La Hacienda, though, everyone is going to lose.

I have frequently added my own voice to the mix, but I do think the same concern could also be voiced about Thai food in this town. Yes, there are quite a few places claiming to serve Thai food, but most of them have pretty much the exact same menus and the authenticity of the food is questionable. Even worse, most of the Thai places in town charge an arm and a leg so dinner for two is generally going to cost you.I am not sure that Siam Cuisine really does anything to address any of the above concerns, but I'd still call this one of my top Nashville Thai places because by and large, the food is really quite tasty. I wish that dining here didn't so often set my husband and I back about $50 when we eat in (due to the cost of drinks + tip on top of our food), but the end result is simply that we don't eat here nearly as often as we otherwise would. I think a large reason why the prices here are high is because we often like to order dishes off their \"Specialty\" section (in particular, we love the crispy duck, duck curry, and the kang curry gai, the latter being a mild curry that I've never found anywhere else and that has a broth that is pure ambrosia!) which tend to be pricier because all of the dishes in this section are served with soup, salad, and a dessert. A lot of time I wish they'd knock $3-4 off the pricetag and just serve me the main dish. I guess I should ask if it's possible for them to do so, but it seems a shame they don't have some easy pricing in their menu that does that already.As for the food itself, it's generally decent, while some of it is very good. The curries are creamy and rich, and the duck is some of the best preparation I've ever had! The real flops are the free soup that comes with your meal, that may not come from a can, but is so generic and blah it might as well. I also really love Tom Kha Gai, and I recently ordered a big bowl of it for my dinner alone. The serving was huge (I got enough for two meals!), but unfortunately the flavors weren't there. TKG is so amazingly flavorful, but what I was served had no zing or zip and was instead pretty bland, and I don't even want to talk about the mangy pieces of chicken in it. So if you're a soup lover, maybe go elsewhere.Overall, this isn't going to be the best Thai food you ever eat, but the food is generally very good and the waitstaff is courteous and effective. The atmosphere has always been pretty chill and quiet whenever I've been, but I'd imagine this place is pretty busy at lunch. Calls for pick-up are fast too, as I generally only have to wait 15 - 20 minutes after placing my order before my food is ready.

This is a very cute little restaurant and the food really isn't particularly bad. It just isn't that good. I'm almost hesitant to call it BBQ. The brisket plate I had the meat was dry, no hint of smoke and not particularly much flavor to speak of. The beans were pedestrian, again, no hint of smoke, no savory sweetness, bland sauce. Canned? That's my bet. What's going on with this? The strips were thin and a little tough to cut with a fork. The cornbread a little dry and the okra, which actually looked like maybe it wasn't out of a bag frozen, had more stringy bits than I'm used to experiencing. Will say the people working here though were really, really nice.There's nothing here resembling the grand Memphis BBQ on the west end of the state, and there sure as hell isn't anything even approaching Kansas City BBQ I'm used to. I could get used to the Carolina sauces and flavors and have enjoyed them in other parts of the South. Whoever is managing this beautiful venue, suggest they get out and eat at a few other places in town, and then have a meal in your own restaurant and tell me you aren't tasting the difference.

I NOW have a greater appreciation of other more negative reviews because the staff in there this afternoon could DEFINITELY use a customer service class....with a good dose of \"take the damn money and keep your mouth shut\"One of the staff, I think overheard me telling my friend (who would not eat after the cashier shenanigans) \u00a0that it was embarrassing and kind of hurt my feelings...I was then asked 3 times in less than 10 minutes if everything was ok... on the meantime I was just cramming food in my mouth trying to eat fast to get the hell out.I have a policy about things like this... I will refrain from going here for 3 months and try again.... and if other negative experiences happen... it will just get crossed off my list.I will say the food is always ok for me... but today the customer service experience was well below average....or what should be experienced.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 27 reviews", "date": "2014-10-03"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nSarah S.\n", "review": "Came for a week long vacation and wanted to something good and fast did a little search at our hotel and this place popped up!!

The game is to get a plate of black bean rice nachos and manage to eat them completely without using a fork or utensil and not look like you escaped from a mental institution.This is a more difficult endeavor than you might image as the plate is literally filled to the edges with nachos, beans, sour cream, rice, jalapenos, tomatoes, spanning a 10-12 inch wide plate and stacked like a pyramid rising 3-4 inches. It's then \"cemented\" together with what looks like volcanic eruption of cheesy goodness and served at a temperature that's somewhere between nuclear and burn ward.It's a whole lot of food when they make it like they usually do, and it comes to you hot and fresh and extremely fast.There's no middle ground with the black bean nachos. You either take them down or you go down fighting, leaving miserable and way way too full. You might even leave that way if you win the game.Additional challenges present themselves in the form of their fruit tea. Sometimes the greatest drink on the planet, the fruit tea is an inconsistent part of the Calypso Cafe experiment. When it's good, it's great, when it's bad, it's still good but is disappointing.People you bring with you can also be considered your enemies as they will attempt to push large, freshly-baked Boija muffins on you as they come two to an order and few can eat more than one.I should mention, silverware is provided. There's no reason you have to attempt to locate the optimum nacho to continue along your eating path. There's also no reason you shouldn't attempt to exercise and improve your cognitive nacho-pulling spacial skills in an attempt to leave no nacho behind while keeping your fingers clean.Should you think you beat the game, well, just remember that you lost the game. And if you don't know what that means a quick google search for The Game, or a look at your waistline after eating the nachos should be enough to cement that.Unfortunately the variety of this place, at least for vegetarians, does not change ever. It may be considered vegetarian friendly, but it's that because you can get a lot of food for little price, not because there's a vast array of choices (there are two that I will eat there.) The beans, they are beans, there's nothing done to them, and the rice, it's not special. The chips come from a bag and the tomatoes, sour cream, cheese, etc are all probably restaurant supply. Vegans are going to have a couple of options here, and I think I may be overselling it by saying a couple.The jerk chicken, I think, is the only thing they seriously work on. Everything else can be considered a plate full of fixin's.But the food is good, the service similarly so, the price reasonable, and as long as you're not attempting to go there when 400 other people are there (lunch) you'll probably have a good all-around time. If you're a vegetarian, go for the black bean rice nachos or black bean salad, I'd avoid the pita / veggie burger options as, well, I hate them and think they are stupid.But that's my opinion, and I just lost the game", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 573 reviews", "date": "2012-01-12"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nBonnie J.\n", "review": "I love Calypso, one of the few healthy choice places to eat.

So at this point I'm thinking this is an okay place, but there really aren't that many options for someone who wants meat. In particular, they lack pork on a lot of their dishes, and I say a lot of their dishes, because I know cubans, and cubans freakin love their pork, and it's like on half their dishes.

The other standard nacho ingredients; chicken, beef, or rice, and BBQ sauce. Simply divine.Black Bean Salad. Lettuce, black beans, tortilla chips, cheddar, tomato, red onion; chicken beef, or rice, and a side of BBQ sauce. Try an extra side of their unbelievable house salad dressing too.Pulled BBQ White Chicken. Fresh, tender, rotisserie chicken with an absolutely amazing sauce. Get it as a sandwich or a plate.Bean and Corn Salad (side). A mixture of beans, corn, in a cilantro vinaigrette. Just yum.Sweet Potatoes (side). The perfect amount of sweet and spice.House Salad dressing. Simple: Pour it on everything.Fruit Tea. Some of the best in town. When in Rome.Calypso Bar.

Yum! There are two ways to look at this place - comparing it to a fine dining establishment versus comparing it to a fast food joint.

I got a burger, and asked for only pickle, and onion. on my cheese burger. I watched the guy make it and he was making a few others at the same time. I saw he added lettuce, tomato and everything to them all. He then asks me \"you got what on yours?\" I said \"onion and pickle only\". He looks at both of the burgers he made and they had the same thing on them (lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle) and he hands me one, as if one didn't have lettuce and tomato. LOLNo big deal, I'll pick it off. I start eating and the burger is really deep red, and cool in the center. :( I don't remember if he asked me how I wanted it done but if he did ask me, I always ask for \"medium well, no pink\".

Unfortunately we went to the old location on Allen Rd that is now closed. I was under the impression that they just opened an ADDITIONAL location, not just moved locations. It wasn't a huge deal though since the new location was only a mile or so up the street. However, even with exact GPS guidance it's still hard to spot due to it's awkward location next to Ace Hardware and the fact that there's no sign other than some painting on the window. Upon entering I was a little afraid my 67 yr old Aunt was gonna look at me crazy for bringing her there. It's very eclectic, funky, rummage sale, dreadlock-ish inside. Luckily Aunt Suzie is the coolest person I know and she felt right at home. As other reviewers have stated, it is a little silly to have the menu board up high and behind where you order. And definitely some directional signs would be helpful. Aunt Suzie originally thought we were supposed to pay at the old-cash-register-turned-condiment -organizer. Bless her. As far as the food goes, what we had was good. I really liked my VIP sandwich and she said her Charlotte wrap was tasty as well. We didn't have to wait long at all for our food. Less than 5 minutes. The things that would make this a 5 star spot for me are the following:*get outdoor signage you can see from the street *get directional signage on the inside. \"Order here\" \"pay here\"* new (or at least in better condition) tables and chairsI get that mismatched stuff is cool and eclectic, but some of the tables and chairs just looked broke down.

I drove a friend up to Vandy for an appointment and decided to have an early lunch here. Finding the place was a little bit difficult because it is BEHIND the ace hardware store in the same parking lot. There wasn't a sign indicating it was there. Parked in front at about 11am. Location looked like it used to be a car garage. Windows were tagged with the name of the business. I thought it was kind of cool. Went in and the place definitely was much larger on the inside. The decor is eclectic and urban. Had a chill atmosphere kinda like just a place to hang out and eat good food. I had to ask where the menu was and it's high up on the ceiling on chalk boards above the door. \u00a0Also told him that it was hard to find and it would be useful to have a bigger sign. One of the guys said that they were having one done and should be up soon. I mentioned that they should have one of the area's graffiti artists to make a sign for them to fit in with the decor. He kinda chuckled but i think he was just humoring me. The kitchen was in the open and everyone seemed to be busy. There was a variety of cold salads that all looked good and healthy. All the ingredients are organic and fresh. They were cooking on an free standing electric grill but they recently moved and it just fits in somehow. It reminded me of a large island cabana roadside food cafe. And EVERYONE knows that those things have the BEST food!! Anyways....The menu items had some crazy names but i think it tied in to the atmosphere well. They had a lot of items to choose from and they all looked good. I chose a turkey, bacon wrap with hummus, avocado and of course a plate of the kale salad! My friend chose the ruban sandwich and we sat down at one of the tables. I looked around a bit while we waited due to the only ones in there at the time. They have lounge couches and an area for a open mike poetry or local band. The garage doors looked like they would open up during the summer months and be kinda like a great place to just chill and have a beer. There wasn't a theme, it was just random and trippy. I loved it. They just picked furniture that they liked. I am a bit of a eclectic myself and i was comfortable. The place was clean!! I don't know why ppl gave such bad reviews. The food was AMAZING. They are not skimpy on the portions either. Most organic places give you a tiny plate that looks too pretty to eat. This place is no joke. It's like an urban free birds ( texas ppl you know what I'm talking about!!) If you're OCD about themes and matching things. And focus on the decor more than the food then you should probably not go there. I could only eat half the wrap and it was fresh!! The humus in it was amazing and the turkey tasted like they had prepared the bird. The bacon was crisp and yummy. The avocado was fresh and the pickle on the side was just crazy good. I could eat a jar of those things. My friend could only eat half of his reuben too. But he said that it was really good as well. One of the best one's he's had. The kale salad was A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!!! I have a love/hate relationship with kale. It's really good for you but i hate the taste of it. The salad had fruit and nuts in it, beans and a citrus dressing!! OMG!! I could of ate a bucket of that stuff. Half way through eating, people started flooding through the door about 12pm. It was a very popular place for lunch and you had a huge variety of people there. Just random people with no theme looking for a great place to eat!! I will def be back to this place when I'm around that area. It's pretty close to the highway too.

So happy they were open on Labor Day.On to the important stuff. It was busy when we went in, around 1230pm, but we were still greeted and as I was clearly overwhelmed with what to order, one of the workers suggested his favorites. I had a turkey wrap, my mother had a caprese sandwich, and we also ordered some spinach and feta hummus. Unlike the other reviewers, I found the decor to be refreshing. There are so many chain restaurants in Nashville, and especially in the Donelson area, that it's wonderful to see a place that thinks outside the box. We are New Yorkers, and Phat Bites feels like home for us. After about a 5 minute wait, we were served and I was ecstatic. Not only was the turkey fresh, it was not deli turkey. Someone clearly slaved over cooking a whole turkey, the mayo was freshly made, the veggies were ripe, and the quick pickle on the side was beyond delicious. My mothers fresh mozzarella was to die for, and the ciabatta bread was up to par with anything we'd get freshly baked in New York. But the hummus was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I would return just for that.If the \"hipster\" decor and staff are too \"dirty\" for you, then you are seriously missing out(by the way, everything I saw was clean and all people preparing food were wearing gloves). Nashville needs to be educated on locally run and sourced restaurants, caf\u00e9s, and delis. Paying $7 for a fresh wrap/sandwich/salad is much better than the same price for a value meal at mcdonalds.

I am all for supporting local businesses, but only when their service is worth it. Today was my first experience with this restaurant and it was not so great. What I am gonna say might seem critical, but they are points that I feel would serve the establishment well if they took notice. First off, the whole chalk board menu thing is cool and all, but there should also be some printed menus up front for people to look at. It is hard to place your order when the menu is behind you. Also when it came to ordering, I just assumed that you went straight to the cash register to place your order. I was quickly advised that I had to place my order back around the corner where there was already a line stacked up. I feel some simple directional signage would have easily helped in this situation. After ordering, my wife and I found our seats and preceded to wait...and wait...and wait some more. Finally our name was called with only one of our orders ready. I assumed the best and figured mine would be out soon. I get it if you are low on staff that day, but maybe just being up front with the customers saying \"it might be a little while longer than normal today\" might help. 50 minutes after ordering, we were forced to go up to the counter and ask about the missing order. She quickly scurried around and found a ticket with my name on it and handed it to me. At this point I was just ready to leave so we took our sandwiches to go and were out.

We sat at the bar and the bartender refused to take our drink orders until we ordered food. We were given to understand the kitchen was about to close (at 9:00 on the Sunday of a holiday weekend?) but not taking drink orders while we briefly reviewed the menu? That's just bad service. Bartender wanted to serve me a cider he'd \"just poured five minutes ago\" that he took out of the fridge below the tap system rather than pour me a fresh drink. He was furious when my husband requested said fresh cider, as if it were somehow my fault that the person who had ordered the stale drink left. We couldn't understand half of what he mumbled even as he flitted around behind the bar and through the restaurant with more nervous energy than I've ever seen outside of a person on drugs. When my husband and I wanted to cancel our food after realizing the bartender was quite likely on drugs, we got a lot of attitude. Rather than give us our bill, he called out the amount and was offended when we requested a print out. After running our card (which he snatched from my husband's hand quite violently) but before we could give him our signed copy, he screamed at my husband to \"get the hell out\" for daring to speak to another customer who had asked for the manager as her party of eight was being mistreated by their server. (The manager was no where to be found by the way, how convenient.) The bartender was so peeved, he finalized our bill and slammed it on the bar without ever viewing the signed copy and before inputting the tip amount.

The breeze blew in, the city skyline sprawled in front of me and I didn't even remember the interstate was hiding behind the building. Check, I do agree the location is spectacular...except stupid parking. It's not really a busy area, it's just that there are limited streets to actually choose from parking on. I snagged a bit of mint from one of the plants and pulled up a happy hour menu while waiting for my friends to arrive. We tossed a table around a bit to coordinate breeze to fan ratio perfection in the humid hot day, the bartender swept around and he was very kind - got us menus, waters, beer for me. Service was greatt, loved the. I'm pay and the easy feeling that we could hang out for hours. What got me down was the food. I wanted slider veg option but had to go for full burger portabello...which really didn't take up more than half the bun and I got a wimpy little slice of gouda on top. So it was a nice slider portion for full price. They aren't totally generous with sweet potato fries. I had just spent an hour and a half between cycling and running so I was ready to get big pile of fries on. Weak. That said, the food was pretty awesome. Bun was just a buttered bun, ingredients were simple but the fries were crispy and I loved the ketchup. Their truffle aioli though is ameteuer overly truffle oiled down and cloggy super greasy, did not like.

When we arrived early, we were all pleasantly surprised to find that our table was ready and waiting for us, so we sat down and began looking at our menu. As avid fans of a good drink, we were initially mostly interested in the adult beverage offerings. Our waiter came around to offer us water, and as we started asking about the seasonal choices for drinks, we realized we might not be getting the drink we hoped for as his knowledge was not only limited as to what they had, but non-existent. :-/ I ordered and Ommegang and some Chips and Guac, to which the waiter repeated back \"An Oh My God??\" While that is a fine name for the new imaginary brewery I would like to establish, it wasn't one that I had ever heard of (or ordered before). So, the waiter forgot my one order of an appetizer, but did remember my OM-meh-gang, and after being reminded of his error, he did eventually bring it out. When the rest of our table finally received our entrees, one of the burgers that was ordered was *severely* undercooked (if we can call it cooked at all). They happily fixed it, but the ordeal was starting to weigh heavy on our laid-back and hungry hearts.The check took about 25 minutes to arrive. Just before handing over our cards, they opened up the garage door-type windows to let the live band play directly into the ears of the sleeping baby that was a part of our group. When the day finally came for us to sign and walk away, I can honestly say that we were all relieved to finally part ways with Pour House.

That, and the food prices, are literally my ONLY complaint about Pour House. (But not a big enough complaint to stop me from going back!) To me, the prices a little steep for what you are ordering.

Turns out a bunch of fire fighters decided to roll in for beer and shots. There was also another huge group in the back booths. Because of this the kitchen and wait staff were experiencing some major delays.Even so, the wait staff tried to be as attentive as possible. Our waiter even tagged in another server when he became overwhelmed trying to close out the group of 20+.For the good, I ordered the buffalo chicken sliders and they were tasty. \u00a0The beer breaded mushrooms were good, but very breaded and a little oily.

Still - hadn't eaten lunch, so it hit the spot and soaked up the tequila.To me, The Pour House is a place to go for Happy Hour with a large group, like your softball team. You can get a small group in other places that are nicer with better food. The music was a bit on the metal side, but wasn't too loud to talk over.

Let me start by pointing out that my average rating is often very high and I tend to avoid writing nasty things about local establishments, even when they deserve it. However, my latest experience at Pour House was so abysmal, it is my Yelp Elite duty to share it with you. My first visit to Pour House with Marcia M. earned three stars. I was unimpressed, but willing to give it some time to grow since it was early in their opening. However, it seems things have only gone downhill since that first visit. Last Saturday night, a friend and I were on the hunt for a new atmosphere and casual place to grab a drink before heading out. My friend hadn't yet been to this new place on 8th Avenue and it seemed like a good idea. After having to move our car twice to find an area where it wouldn't be towed, we realized we should have cut our losses then and found a better solution. But, we like to take risks I guess, so we ventured on. Once inside the formaldehyde-smelling restaurant - seriously, this place has an odor that makes me wish I could cuddle up for hours in Red Door's smoke infestation - we found a spot at the bar. There's no drink menu, so the ordering process is kind of a crap shoot - and crap it was! They opened a tab for me and set my debit card in a small cup near the POS. After we choked down our drinks and tried to pretend the smell wasn't giving us a headache, we asked the unfriendly, unhelpful bartender to close our tabs. After a few minutes of her shuffling through the THREE (count 'em, three) cards in the cup, she turned to ask me if she had taken my card. Indeed she did only moments before (Hello, remember?!?! Idiot!). \u00a0As she continued to lazily look around the bar area, I did a little research to find that my debit card had been charged another amount. You're following correctly... they closed someone else's tab on my debit card and sent them on their way with it. A result I don't blame the customer, who may have not noticed, for but rather the Einstein's behind the bar. The bartender called her manager over, who was equally as unhelpful and unapologetic. He offered to void the transaction that they charged (UMMM, you think?!?! Duh!!!). \u00a0Meanwhile, the at-fault bartender handed me and my friend our ticket for the drinks. Seriously? The manager quickly disappeared into the back and it was up to me to find a solution. I grabbed a piece of paper and pen and wrote my number on it, \"call me if the customer comes back in with my card please,\" I told the bartender. I then took a separate piece of paper, not trusting that she'd actually remember what had happened at all in 5 minutes, and asked to see the manager. He came out from the back and I told him the same thing. He said he'd call if it turned up - although he's done nothing to apologize or even check in. I never heard from them, so I had to close my debit card and sat at home for a week waiting for it to arrive. (Awesome.) And here's the best part: they never voided the transaction - at least not the one they charged to my card. I was expected to pay for another customer's tab? I don't think so. This is single handily the worst experience I've had in Nashville to date, and needless to say, I will not be back.

The environment is very nice and the beer and sprits selections are impressive. Didn't take long to get service once we seated ourselves, but we were so loud it was probably hard to ignore us.

As for parking complaints - I don't get it. \u00a0Parking is a premium around there, many of the other establishments DO tow around there (I've witnessed it twice now), and so you pay a buck or two to know your car won't be towed, and you're dropped off at the door - nice I say. You can still try and park w/o valet - good luck, seems silly and risky to me.2. They DO have drink menus, including all bourbons, etc. \u00a0If you don't see one - ASK, I'm sure they will oblige. Like any restaurant, even the products they purchase are discontinued or changing constantly, so there may be a few items listed no longer available, and some not listed - big deal.3.

(Note to Le Peep: Eggs come from chickens. Sausage does not.) In a vain attempt to render the egg-type-substance edible, I asked for a little salsa.

Despite my temptation to ditch my dinner plans and spend my night getting sloshed at M.L. Rose next door, I knew the pretty girl waiting for me at Koi would be perturbed.Little did I know that in addition to Sapporo and the usual beer selection, Koi also has a score of rotating microbrews. Score! That gave me something delicious to sip on as I pored over the menu--which is absurdly long. I settled on...drumroll please...sushi and Thai.On the sushi side of the menu, the portions are substantial. The hunks of tuna on the nigiri were gynormous, and the rolls are similarly large--although the speciality rolls have speciality prices. I got a spicy tuna roll and found it to be an average value for the price.For my Thai food, I tried a cup of the tom kha soup, which was OK but not spectacular. If Koi management is reading this, you definitely need more galangal and kaffir lime leaves in the soup to make it more authentic. I also ordered the pad kra prow (basil chicken) and asked for it to be prepared 5/5 spicy, and while I personally would have liked it spicier, I think what I got is at the upper end of most people's tolerances. The flavor was reasonably decent, too, and I enjoyed the leftovers the next day.Koi loses a point for authenticity. I find that to be common at many of the \"hybrid\" Thai/sushi places.

First off, you can either walk up or drive-thru. There's no inside seating. If you walk up, you can park it on the small patio and go to town, but I've never seen anyone do that. This is a place you come to get your grub and, then, peace out. Sounds simple but get this: if there's a line, pops (or one of the older sons/nephews) sends the younger ones outside to take orders -- thereby (doing what?) KEEPING IT MOVING. You *know* what a fan I am of keeping it moving. It's part of the business model at King Solomon's. Adding to the process, everyone's incredibly nice. The younger guys are well-mannered (or, I'm old; they always call me sir). The older guys are very cool and equipped with good conversation and pops does his thing making sure that the machine keeps running.And we haven't even gotten to the food. I don't know how long King Solomon's has been here but I want to believe that it's been a little while now. And I want to believe that it's proof that Nashville's always been a food city. Yes, now the spotlight's on the city and people are looking around but, back in the day, unless you lived on the east side, people weren't clamoring to come to Greenwood to get some food... and now they are... as they should be. If you're a fan of Greek eats, come here. You'll escape with your wallet intact and your belly distended and full. While there are plenty of non-gyro options on the menu, why bother? Come here for the good stuff. Get a gyro. Now, you can get it in pita form, a plate (with yellow rice, salad, pita, and plenty of cucumber sauce), FRIES (spicy fries with gyro meat and sauce... do you hear me??!!), or a meat bomb (I have no idea what it was; one of the older guys gave it to me and told me that it's his personal go-to/invention; I just recall it was a football-sized pita full of meat and sauce and i couldn't stop eating it).

There weren't many clams and the flavor was meh, and sadly that's where the food peaked. The clam strip basket I ordered was missing the french fries and instead of tartar sauce, it came with mayonnaise. That didn't really matter however, because the clam strips themselves had been deep fried to just short of burned. Worse, it was clear these strips were the Sea Pak brand you could buy in the frozen food section of any grocery store.But that was nothing compared to the whole clams my wife ordered, which were clearly past their expiration date. It was as if they had gone from shell to fryer without being cleaned, and tasted like they had started to spoil.Since neither of us was willing to try again on the clams, I got the meatball grinder and my wife had the coconut shrimp. All I will say is they should have used some of the garlic from my tomato sauce and added it to her shrimp.

The BTE cocktail was $6.50 of fruity light-headedness. I can dig it. As for the food, ya gotta keep it simple: seafood and something fried. I opted for the seafood burger and fries. The burger sounds like it should be a mess, but it works. It's a patty made up of lobster, scallops, crab, whitefish, and shrimp -- along with peppers and onions. I don't know how they did it and I didn't ask. But, that's the burger. It comes with lettuce, tomato and garlic butter. And, that's all you need. The burger is substantial, filling and scratches the seafood-loving/needing itch. The fries that come with... addicting.

This place is literally right next to Five Points Pizza, so the parking situation is the same. There is a paid lot across the street and it's $3.00 for 2 hours (the machine accepts credit cards). Convenient, but annoying at the same time.This place has a Boston theme to it, but when I was looking around I noticed it pretty much only had stuff for the Red Sox. I think another reviewer noted this, and it didn't necessarily bother me but just an observation. They did have some pretty cool memorabilia though, so I can appreciate that. Our server (can't remember his name now) was nice enough, but definitely not one of those above and beyond experiences.We sat really close to the sushi preparation area, but none of us decided to go that route. Just seems a little bit odd considering the type of restaurant. We decided to order the pickle chips first. They were sliced sweet pickles, which really threw me off. Every other time I've had them at other places, they've been dill pickles. So the taste was a little strange at first, but it wasn't terrible. Just not what I'm used to. My boyfriend also got the clam chowder, which I was able to try, and it was actually really good. It came out super thick (I was expecting something a little more soup-like) but had a really good flavor to it.My boyfriend and I went with the fish and chips, and my brother got the Polish sausage. I don't really understand why they put the fries in a paper bag, because you're just going to dump them out anyway... But they did have the malt vinegar to put on the fries, which were excellent. The fish was cooked really well, and the breading was very light and not too greasy. I got 3 pieces but I wish I knew how big they were before I ordered. They were massive! (not a bad thing of course) But if I would have known that, I probably would have opted for 1 or 2 pieces. My brother commented that the Polish sausage tasted like a hot dog.

The chicken was grilled with no seasoning and was barely cooked. Rubbery at best. And the salad dressing was not the one I ordered. My wife got the salmon.

The place was pretty crowded when we walked in so I thought, \"the food must be really good\"! \u00a0We were seated right away but we got put at a 2 person table. Normally this isn't a problem but the table was soooo small. There wasn't much room to put the food and it was making me feel uncomfortable so I asked if we could move to a bigger table once the crowd died down. Server was nice & accommodated us. The atmosphere of the place was full of Red Sox stuff on the walls. One side of the place was the bar area, which looked like the kind of place I wouldn't mind hanging out with a couple of friends. The place overall was clean, average size, very casual. Server came & took our drink order & food order in a timely fashion. The menu itself was a good amount of choices. And I love Sushi so that was a nice addition to have a good size sushi menu also. Although, \u00a0as someone mentioned in another review a \"gaijin\" is making the sushi. I didn't try any there but saw an order come by for another table. The sushi looked good & a generous size portion on the rolls. Wish I would have tried one. We ordered the Ceviche appetizer. It's made with crab meat, cilantro, tomatoes, onions & peppers, sliced avocado on top and tortilla chips on the side. I have had Ceviche all over, especially in the Carribbean. This tasted different, not like the ceviche I'm used to so maybe this is more of a East-Coast Boston? type Ceviche. Maybe this is how it's traditionally made there. But just so you know it is different, a different flavor profile. I didn't taste lime juice...if it had it, there wasn't nowhere near enough in it for a ceviche. The taste was good, ok, but not anything special and for the $9.99 price tag, I was a bit disgusted that it was just ok & that the portion was not very big. For that price I expected a huge plate full for us to share. I know crab is an expensive ingredient but still I think this was overpriced for what it was. \u00a0If we go back I would pass on that. \u00a0 Oh and another thing I wanted to mention about the menu was that they had NO lunch specials! They had a couple of specials on the sushi rolls but no lunch portioned/cheaper specials on the dinners. Everything is pricey on their menu too, compared to other seafood restaurants who have similar items. And especially for such a casual restaurant. Our lunch was $50 for 2 people. We both had water, 1 appetizer, & 2 entrees. Most working people can't afford to spend that kind of money on lunch! \u00a0Or not very often anyway. This place could do more business I'm sure if they had lunch specials. Back to the food. My hubby ordered the seafood platter- $16.99. \u00a0It had \u00a0a piece of fish, clams, scallop, oysters, & shrimp, fries & slaw. The fried seafood has a nice crispy coating. \u00a0My husband said it was all ok. We've been to a lot of very good seafood restaurants so we don't go overboard if the food is just average. My dinner was the Atlantic Whole Belly Clams- $16.99. It was an 8 oz. portion of the whole belly clams, cole slaw & fries. I had never seen the whole belly clams on a menu anywhere near here. This is a specialty up North on the East coast too. I saw them talked about on a food tv show & they raved about how much better they were than just regular clams. They tasted like an oyster, more juicy like one. But I think my order was over cooked so the clams were a bit too chewy & not as tender as I expected them to be. Slaw was good, fries were good. The sauces that came with both platters were ok but they were both homemade. . \"The tarter \u00a0was homemade but looked like a creamy mayo with not much else in it. The cocktail sauce almost reminded me of a marinara sauce, a bit chunky and the taste was so so,. They had way too much pepper in that sauce. Oh & all the seafood, sauces, and even the chips with the ceviche was FULL of salt! Now, I like salt a lot & use it on just about everything so for me to say it's heavily salted than wow, it was on the verge on not being edible.So with all that said, this place is an average seafood restaurant but with big prices. Should you go out of your way to visit it, no. If you have the money to splurge on an expensive seafood dinner, this isn't the place either. So disappointed...it really COULD be a great place.

The layout, decor, and overall space is promising for a concert. They of course have an incredible wine selection, upscale bar food, and descent amenities to offer you during your visit. Although the positives for City Winery are plenteous, I would say there are a few areas they kept me from giving them 5 stars.The first opportunity I found was with the valet. Although I read previous post about the price, which is $5, my concern was simply with the staff. These people are your first experience with the venue and they were very unfriendly and uninviting to my wife and I. Yes, you took my car and brought it back to me at the nights end but try and be as upbeat and excited as the workers inside the facility. Secondly, would have to deal with the food. I will openly admit that these opportunities fall solely on personal preference and not solid data but I believe there were some concerns. First, if you are offering a special, only allowed for the restaurant and not the stage area, don't put it on the projectors and show it to me every four minutes. Secondly, 98% of the food offered was not sharable but was also too large. I understand I'm at a restaurant but at the same time I am not. I have experienced in other locations shareable, medium size dishes worked better. Lastly, I didn't enjoy my food. My wife and I purchased the truffle fries and risotto balls for an appetizer then a hamburger, which was a burnt on the outside and raw in the middle, and a chicken dish which my wife enjoyed. The dining is attempting to be upscale and new age but seemed to miss the mark with each selections. The fries come with a garlic mayo which does nothing except take away from the fry. The risotto ball, which should come with marinara sauce, is accompanied with BBQ sauce and spicy mustard. Both offering nothing to highlight the flavors of their counterparts. \u00a0You can see the definite potential with City Winery but these are just a few areas where attention could be shown. Lastly, on a side note. If you are going to a concert and truly care about your view and sound quality, I would definitely recommend forgetting the front sections of sits. Although this is usually my section of choice, the venue and atmosphere of food, wine, and conversation with your neighbors really demands you sit in the second section and back.

Don't try to park in the adjacent lot unless you want to be stopped by security in a golf cart.Since I had a ViP ticket, I was escorted to my seat. I don't know if the tables are always that close together, but I am on the lower end of a \"normal\" weight range and I felt like it was a tight squeeze. Not just on each side but even scooting my chair out. The person at the table behind me could not have pulled his chair out simultaneously with me. We were that close.The bathrooms were okay. They ran out of paper towels and they stayed out through the evening.The wine list is not as impressive as the name would lead you to believe. No Moscato anywhere on the list if you can believe that... Not even available by the bottle. I am such a Moscato fanatic (my dog is named after it if that gives you any indication), I would have bought a whole bottle despite being a two drink max girl. But alas it was not meant to be.I wound up getting a burger with those truffle fingerlings with some Chardonnay (sweet, but moscato you were not). The food was... Ok.I hadn't eaten all day. All I had had was caffeine. Caffeine and adrenaline. And somehow I didn't even manage to eat half the burger. I don't know...And I love truffle oil. Truly do. On fries. Tater tots. Grilled cheese. You name it. But, I found these needed salt and some (gasp!) ketchup to go with as they lacked seasoning. Service during the show was good. And quiet. She literally managed to get me my bill without me noticing she had placed it down.I also love the water at the table - reminds me of Bailey's Chocolate Bar in St Louis. It also saves the waiters time.But after the concert, the service was not so nice. A hostess came up to me to ask me where I got where I was wearing. She said another hostess absolutely loved it. I told her it wasn't a dress but a top and skirt but that only the petticoat was still available. She huffed off. Told the other hostess and not so nice commentary ensued after as if they didn't believe me when I said it was no longer available - it sold out circa 2013...

Overall, I was pretty pleased with the meal, especially the pork belly which was crisp and succulent. The risotto balls were also good and reminded me of falafel.

I'm just starting to understand different types of wines and an amateur at best in describing what I want in a wine. The waiter was well-trained and did not lead us astray when we were making our selection from the multiple wines on tap, available for a glass, and those available by a bottle. We tried a couple of these before we left and weren't disappointed. The food. It was good, not great. I had the leg of lamb pizza, which was tasty with a good mix of spices, crunchy pine nuts, and melty cheese.

We had front-table seats, \u00a0this should have been great. Unfortunately the assigned seating up there meant I spent the time faced almost completely away from the performers. I was jammed next to a couple I didn't know, had very little space behind me, so turning my chair was not particularly a feasible option. Very little room behind or to the sides.I took a break from looking at the stage after a while because my neck hurt so much from craning it. I noticed there were plenty of free and open seats and tables, and the aisles they had constructed were huge so they could have given people a lot more space at the tables simply by not allowing 4 people to walk side by side in the aisles.If we'd just had enough space to turn the chairs 90 degrees in the viewing situation would have been pleasant. We were packed in the sardine fashion, which was absurd because there were plenty of free tables.Got up a couple of times to hit the restroom, just stayed standing off at the side of the stage until I felt like getting into the table pit again.The food was alternately great and just ok, but the prices for everything were on the pricey side. I'll remind I was there for the performance, not for the food. My neck, back, and ears were annoyed by nearly everything at about five songs in.Basically a slightly layout change to the tables would solve most of it, open seating after a certain point would have been nice, ability to get the car parked and unparked sans valet would be great.By the time I left I was in a mood. For a music venue they could be so great, but it's just not set up for that and the way they have the up front seating.

There is an upstairs event space, a spacious bar area and a great stage set up. A group of 6 of us ordered dinner while watching the Marc Cohn show last week. Dinner: Everyone enjoyed the food. The service was less than impressive though. The server seemed to be overwhelmed by the tables he had. It took forever for him to take orders for cocktails. Then an even longer forever to come back with cocktails. Then add on some more forever to take out orders.Nothing ruins a beautiful dining experience like subpar service. You can correct an underwhelming dish, but underwhelming service can ruin an experience for me. Having been a server/bartender for a number of years I am both very critical (internally) but also forgiving (externally) when it comes to service. I am never rude, even if the service is subpar. That being said, it is an absolute pet peeve of mine when a server cannot keep up with who ordered what at a table of 6. In an establishment as nice as City Winery that just should not be the case. It is a complete moodkiller for the server to have people at the table check off what they had on a printed out receipt. It is even more annoying when the server encourages the table to split the check evenly because \"it's easier that way\". Unless there is a policy against separate checks that is indicated to a party at the outset, it is the server's responsibility to separate checks. It is a pain in the a** to do so, but that is what is expected. Ultimately we ended up splitting it evenly because after the 2nd return everyone was irritated.

I've now been to City Winery 3 times and remain less than impressed.SERVICE: The service at City Winery is either on overdrive and in your face or non existent and there doesn't seem to be a happy medium. During my last visit to City Winery on Friday (upstairs in the \"lounge\") our waiter asked for our drink orders and food orders at the same time. Our food came out first, after about 20 min (without even water on the table) and then about 10 min later, we got our drinks. Also, on a previous visit I was denied a taste of one of CW's on-tap wines because the bar was \"too busy\". PRICE: Pricing for shows is competitive. PARKING: Valet - I've been charged $5 sometimes then they didn't collect payment another time..not sure what the deal is, but they never seem to have enough attendants working for when a show that seats a few hundred lets out at one time.FOOD: The food is tasty, nothing extraordinary, especially with the great food scene in this city. A little pricy.SEATING: Unless you buy seats at an entire table you'll be sitting with strangers, which can be fun, but not when you're literally rubbing elbows with them. The tables are tiny and wayyyy to small to seat strangers together. Also, it's a bummer that you have to buy a seat - City Winery is more about selling the \"experience\" than a ticket to a great show. Also, you're SOL if you have more people in your group than a table can accommodate, so I would be very hesitant to say this place is group friendly. Overall, Nashville has such wonderful, unique and historic venues (lookin at you Ryman, Marathon Music Works, War Memorial Auditorium) that I'm not really sure how or why City Winery has a place here.

We have been to City Winery twice now. The first time we went, we did as the website had suggested which was to come between 6-7 for dinner before the show. WAY too early, as it was awkward to be in the music venue with all these empty tables around you. It just felt weird. The food wasn't that great either. The only thing we ordered that we liked was the truffle fingerling potatoes. The flatbread was soggy, and the cheese plate was underwhelming and expensive for the stingy portions. \u00a0We were disappointed that a winery boasting such a large list doesn't sell any bottle of wine for under $40. The second time we went, we ate dinner beforehand and decided to just have some wine during the show. We ordered a 2010 Malbec that she opened right when she got to the table (in the dark - you can't see!) and poured for us to taste, BUT we were never shown the bottle until she had poured it out and walked away. It was 2011. Not a big deal for inexpensive wine, but if I had been buying a $200 bottle that was wrong, I would have been incensed.When we got the bill, (it had slipped past us on our previous visit) we noticed that they charged the Liquor By The Drink tax that EVERY other restaurant in the ENTIRE STATE builds into their pricing, but City Winery charges it ON TOP of your already overpriced drink. So a $40 is really $46, a $15 whiskey is $17.25 plus sales tax etc...it is in small print on the menu, but you feel gouged already, and then that tax just seems like a big F-You. Paying for rude valets who don't even unlock the door for you, much less open it, plus overpriced food that isn't good, and really overpriced drinks just made us feel nickeled and dimed.

It's in an area that has the space for parking, in fact, there is parking all around.

The trouble is I (and the community seems to agree) that it doesn't warrant itself for this yet. I pulled in seeing the valet (and probably at fault of my own for not asking) assumed it was how all the other valet in town is - complementary because you are visiting that restaurant/bar.

I had a couple of small tastings at the event (which I assume) were from City Winery's kitchen - they were yummy, but my friends opted to go someplace else for dinner - one citing she had eaten there before and it was just okay, not great. The decor was a little corporate-cheesy - reminded me of the Cheescake Factory or something you would see in an upscale chain restaurant. While I know there are other City Winery locations in the US, it would have been cool to tailor the decor to more of a Nashville feel. The sound for the DJ/yogi's mics was not quite right - hope that's not indicative of what the sound for shows. I imagine there is a sound tech and soundcheck that would eliminate the poor sound. It was just fine for the purpose for which I was there for, but would be disappointing if it were a concert.

Great sound, physically spacious yet intimate-feeling. Except for my first experience, for Sturgill Simpson in August which was a crowd of Americana fans and a private event, I have never yet seen the place full, however. it's early, though, and I'm sure it's still getting its footing. It's about a 300-seat venue, which really helps you feel connected with the artist, but a lot of that has to do with the act, as well. It's not really great that you have to share a table for eight with people you don't know for dinner and a show; it'd be nice if there were more tables for two and four, as there are hardly any in the whole house.The menu, however, is less impressive. Pretentious is okay if you can back it up with taste, but it's just not there. So, it's a pretentious and pricey fail. Since City Winery is a wine venue, it thinks it has to offer only complicated dishes, and I enjoy the occasional highbrow reduction or unusual flavor combination. The friend who was with me, however, does not, and that's okay, too. Sometimes wine is best when it accompanies something simple, and there is not even one menu item that might be qualified as uncomplicated or unfussy. Not one. Take a look at your menu, Chef, and relax it a bit. Give us a variety of options, to appeal to a variety of diners, in the way the sommelier offers the wine list. Everybody will win.I will say that our server, whose name was Matt, I believe, was very patient and was happy to take time to explain every description and answer every question we had. I ended up with the beet salad, and when that proved too spicy because of the cayenne pepper, I ordered the cheese plate and made that work, although I did not enjoy the horseradish spread that was one of the accompaniments. Also, when we arrived, the seating staff said that we were to sit at separate tables, and of course, I wasn't going to have any of that. Our arrangements had us seated together, and I was polite, but had to insist that they check their seating chart notes again. After just a few minutes, we were led to one of the few tables for two, off to the side but still well in view of the music. I was happy that they made the effort to correct the error without any attitude at all. I did attend a private event at one of the smaller upstairs rooms that also had a little stage and a bar. I was helping at that event, so did not experience it as a patron, but I did notice that the bartenders were friendly and helpful, and the waiters seemed prompt at the tables. The hors d'oeuvres trays, however, lacked variety and imagination. Anyone can put crackers and cheddar on a plate with strawberries, but to be fair, maybe that is what the client ordered from the catering staff.The parking is what everybody else says it is, but I have had great luck with the valet staff being exceptional every time. I've never waited more than a few minutes for my car. They really ought to offer the valet as complimentary, however, since there aren't any other real parking options.

My wife and I have eaten at many of the newer restaurants around town and have enjoyed the majority of them. We went to City Winery last night to watch a show and eat dinner. Here are my thoughts:First, the good: Cool place, nice outdoor seating for just drinks or a meal. The inside is really nice and the concert area is cool and spacious.Now for the bad: No parking and forced to pay $7 for valet service--that is in addition to the tip. The food is edible but not special. Smoked avocado dip is just run of the mill and very thin chips that broke when we tried to dip with them. The entr\u00e9es--my wife had bacon and beet flatbread and I had the chicken--were overpriced for the quality of the food. Chicken was very average and the side of grits was nothing special. The flatbread was just flatbread--nothing special. For the name--City Winery--the wine selection was poor and the beer list was also limited (Nashville has awesome local brews, but there were only two on the menu).The acoustics were not good either. We were seated in the upper deck and couldn't even understand the musicians when they talked and sang (maybe the sound quality is better on the main floor); I was expecting much better in such a new and intimate setting.Overall, this would be a decent place to go to hear a band or singer if you could be fairly close to the stage, but I would recommend eating elsewhere since there are many options nearby.

Their attempt at brunch was lackluster, uninspired, and left our party disappointed. City winery has obviously put a great deal of thought into its role as a wine bar, but brunch was clearly an afterthought that has yet to grow to maturity. \u00a0Nashville has such a great culinary community that we were sad we wasted Sunday brunch here.Service- disorganized and confused. Two servers (one may have been the manager) approached us to take our drink order, and neither was very timely about it. Both food and drinks took a long time to order and come out. \u00a0The glass bottles of water on the table warmed quickly in the sun, and the server refilled the water only at our specific request. \u00a0Patio service seemed to be an afterthought.Drinks- the spicy Bloody Mary is vibrant, but the glass was tiny and filled with ice, which made the $9 price tag a shock.Food- when we first sat, we asked the waiter/manager what jumped out on the menu. \u00a0His response seemed to be that brunch was a way to let people try the food without the price tag of dinner. \u00a0 His response made sense when the food came out much later. \u00a0Steak and eggs were well prepared, but with small portions and so poorly plated it was more akin to white plate Waffle House. Flavor was lacking, prompting the table to wonder whether salt/pepper shakers should have been on the table. Shrimp and grits were filling, but tails were detached and mixed in with the grits, which required some digging. All in all, at $18 and $15, respectively, the price was far higher than the value.Ambience- great patio, and the venue is beautiful, but didn't meet its potential to entertain. For Nashville, we were amazed there wasn't some form of music, live or otherwise. Thankfully, the next door Rescue Mission had a live band.Overall, city winery seems a classy place to grab a bottle of wine and cheese plate. \u00a0Otherwise, best avoided.", "location": "\nAtlanta, GA\n", "exp": " 5 reviews", "date": "2015-04-12"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nCarolyn M.\n", "review": "What a fun music venue.

My friend bought a deal on Travel Zoo and we were both pretty excited to actually be able to go out for Sunday brunch, since we are both usually working a brunch shift on Sundays. The place was fairly easy to find, and they had their own parking lot, which is a plus for a restaurant so close to the heart of downtown Nashville.The building was enormous yet beautiful, with lots off wood panels and seating available outside. Their restaurant was fairly full, but it's also spacious enough so it did not feel crowded. They had a full bar, which included wine on tap, and I saw noticed a large party all sitting together, so yes, they are able to accommodate large parties. We made a 12:00 reservation, but arrived 15 minutes early. We were greeted by a friendly manager who was happy to show us to our table, despite our early arrival. We asked him to sit outside since the weather was beautiful, and he gladly showed us to a table outdoors. I felt very welcomed and comfortable.We scanned the menu, which was smaller in size than many restaurants, but I personally find that an attractive feature because it makes decision-making easier We started off with a couple of \"brunch cocktails;\" mine was called the Spanish Violet (I think) which had a very soft violet color, a citrusy taste, and a lemon peel garnish. My friend ordered some peach mimosa, which wasn't bad. I wish I had stuck with a classic mimosa, or maybe the brunch cocktail that had orange juice in it because the more I drank my Spanish Violet, the less I liked it. For an appetizer, we ordered the pastry platter, which came with a wide assortment of delicious pastries, butter, and apple butter. This was probably my favorite part of my dining experience, and I highly recommend starting with this if you dine hear for brunch.For entrees, I ordered the vegetable frittata and my friend had the huevos rancheros. They were OK I suppose, though I would question what they think a frittata is. Both of our entrees were drizzled with might have been sriracha, which I loved, but my friend did not since she is sensitive to spicy foods. We were full after we finished, so redeemed our coupon, received our check, and that's all she wrote.The manager did a great job creating a great first impression, and really setting us up for a wonderful dining experience. If only our server followed suit. My biggest complaint with her was how long it took her to greet us. I had my phone with me, so I was able to check the time in semi-regular intervals since I had somewhere to be at 2:00, and I remember it took our server at least 5 minutes to even acknowledge us. Luckily, the had water carafes on the table, so we did not have to wait for her to drink some water. After sitting down, it took about 10 minutes to order our brunch cocktails and another 7 minutes or so to order our appetizer. I understand servers get busy and weeded, but we were one of three tables outside, and even though inside was busy, they had plenty of open tables, so surely, our server could not have been that weeded. \u00a0Luckily, the kitchen was working at a regular pace and there were food runners on the clock because it did not take us very long to get our food. While we were munching on our pastries, our server took our entree order, which was at least 20-25 minutes after sitting down. Afterwards, I only saw her twice; once to actually check on us while we were eating our entrees, and again to deliver the check. On one hand, maybe she thought that my friend and I were the type who needed space, so she didn't have to be around so much, but it was also the way she spoke with us and how promptly she took care of a neighboring table that implied she did not care for us (maybe because we're young? I work in a restaurant, I know how much it sucks to deal with college-aged customers).Our entrees and brunch cocktails were taken care of because of the coupon, but the check was still almost $25 dollars because of the pastry platter (which I knew wasn't included in the coupon) and taxes. Our server ended up charging us for the pastry platter for 4, rather than for 2. I brought it to the attention of the manager, who was the same person who seated us, and he said he would change it. Instead, he took it off of our bill! Overall, I had an OK experience. I would have left four stars if our service was better, but maybe also two stars (perhaps a little harsh?) if the manager wasn't so accommodating. Would I come back?

You walk in and immediately feel at home. The whole club, from bar area to bathrooms to the showroom, is intimate without being cloying. It fills a huge gap in this city, which has needed an upscale club inbetween tiny 75-100 seaters (eg Bluebird Caf\u00e9) and larger halls (Ryman). Very clean, great bathrooms, nice bar area. Lots and lots of wood.They're making their own wine next year, and the gigantic barrels are eye candy if you like good vino. The wine lists (there are 2) are comprehensive. Some very reasonably priced , but that's because they charge YOU the liquor tax. Be forewarned.Food is better than expected. Risotto balls, recommended by our waitress, were excellent (though I'd go for spicier mustard). Pork tacos ditto. The steak was two lovely pieces of meat - though the chef has a heavy salt hand. (Maybe they're salting and letting it sit to tenderize? Still, it shouldn't be that salty.) I don't recommend the mussels, and the cheese tray is absurdly small for what you pay, but the ravioli was gorgeous. The burgers are very good, and there's a vegetarian option too.I'd recommend the meze platter, except that we had it our first visit (opening night) and it was large enough for four. Last visit it had shrunk considerably. The bad: Five dollar parking charge? Really? The attendants make it clear that your $5 goes to the venue, so you're expected to tip on top of it. But there's NO street parking!!Getting seated is a work in progress. I've been here 5 times so far, alone, with family, with business associates. Each time, we arrived at 6 pm, when they opened. Each time, wait staff weren't ready. Each time, there's a meaningless cluster of hosts and hostesses? standing by the entry doors, doing anything but paying attention to the customers. Each time we were sent to the \"concierge\" for tickets and information. Forgive my being snotty about it, but how many City Winery employees does it take to seat someone? If it happened once, all right. But every time? Food service is slooooow. Don't come hungry. I don't know if the wait staff are over-loaded or what, but when you go out for an expensive evening like this, you expect better service. My waitrons have all been nice, but far from the kind of competency I experienced at the NY or Chicago clubs.Food is expensive for what you get. (Online menu prices changed?) Our party of four had a bottle of inexpensive wine, 3 Tito's vodkas, and two beers, plus mains and 2 appetizers) was $310 before tip. I think that's expensive. Portions aren't big enough for leftovers. If this were The Palm, I'd expect it, and I'd be satisfied knowing the quality would be wonderful AND I'd have enough for another meal next day. The wait staff are friendly, but scattered. Ask for salt and pepper. Ask again. And again. Finally ask a bus boy, who brings it eventually. My wife's burger arrived with fries, everything looked great, but by the time salt and ketchup arrived everything was cold. This is not unusual here, but I can no longer excuse it as growing pains.And they don't pay the liquor tax?!?! This is the only restaurant in Nashville charging the customers for it - even Kayne Prime, home of 50 cent charge per blue cheese olive in your drink, doesn't charge liquor tax. Really, between food prices and liquor tax, I would not suggest eating here.The ugly:Sound problems. It carooms off the back wall so you can't hear vocals at all if there's a band - of the 3 we've seen, this was a problem with all of them. It's all right for an acoustic act like Taj Mahal, but something needs to be done. Who opens a club in Nashville without consulting a sound engineer? Everyone in my party, each time, was disappointed in the sound quality.Seating is, to put it bluntly, horrendous. At first glance, it's very pretty - until you realize that a) no matter where you sit, you're not facing the stage, and b) chairs are tiny, and tables are about a foot shy of the standard 2 or 4 seat table length. What this means is that no matter how much you pay, or what you reserve, you're going to be miserably uncomfortable. My wife is petite, our daughter is likewise, but even they complained that they couldn't eat without elbowing one another. The sideways-only seating means you don't get to enjoy the show the way you would with concert-style. I understand you can't do the concert-style and serve dinners, but I'd love to see this place change up so half the table is facing the stage. The other half could just turn their chairs around for the show. As it is, no one was happy with the seats.All in all, I will continue to attend when I'm in town, because they're bringing in a lot of acts you wouldn't normally see in Nashville. But I'll dine elsewhere.

We were really pumped, because I managed to get great seats on the first night (4 seats back from the stage). The wife is a huge fan, so she was incredibly happy about the seats and the show. Unfortunately, we happened to be seated next to a VIP investor in City Winery, who didn't happen to know dooku about the talent on the stage. Typical bloated businessmen with trophy wives (one of which was Googling Jason Isbell during the show and blurted out that he had \"Played with the Drive By Truckers\"). You know these kind of businessmen: hang out at cigar bars, eat at Mortons, and live in the Governors Club. Thankfully however, they realized that they didn't really care for the artist on the stage (other than the fact that someone told them how \"great\" Isbell is, and they had to see him for prestige reasons), so they left half-way through his set. Bonus for us, we ended up front row!Onto the place itself!1) Service. Our server was great! In fact, I don't think there is a bad server in the place. They manage to be unobtrusive yet attentive at the same time. They also manage to maneuver through the seating area without disrupting the show (the same can not be said of bloated businessmen!).2) Venue. The venue is really classy, clean, has a great feel and even better sound. Given the tasteful use of recycled and new wood both inside and out, the backdrop for the stage is a bit corny (City Winery logo on plywood set against a gray Corian panel), \u00a0But who cares. You get a great show!3) Food. This is where they need some help. We just had a few appetizers. Risotto balls and truffle fries. Neither was all that tasty. They weren't bad. They just lacked flavor. Maybe the entrees are better? But the prices aren't that bad. You'd hope they have some better stuff to go with the great wine options. Speaking of which...4) Wine. Well, wine is their schtick, so let's talk about it. We tried a few of the \"on-tap\" wines. The Syrah was good. The Malbec is better. They sell by the glass, by the carafe or half-carafe. The prices aren't bad on these, UNTIL YOU SEE THE CHECK!!! This may only apply to the the house wines which are dispensed from barrels, but they charge you separately for the Liquor By The Drink (LBTD) tax, which is 15%. I'd like to say I KNEW if it only applied to tap wines, but our server (who was otherwise great) served us tap wine on our second night instead of the bottle wine I ordered. To do the math for you, if you order the $42 carafe of Malbec, you'll be paying $53 after 15% LBTD tax and another 9.25 % sales tax. ANYWHERE else in Nashville, brewers, servers and distillers include this tax into the price of a served drink. There's a tiny footnote on the back of the menu that mentions this tax. So, if you don't like surprises, be sure to ask your server if the tax applies to all beverages, or just barrel wine.If I could sum it all up under pros and cons:Pros: Great wine, great service, great venue, excellent staff all around, good prices on food.Cons: Wine taxes are brutal, food needs a bit more flavor, valet parking when the show gets out looks to be a real CF.

I am so sad that it's taken us this long to discover El Tapatio! Everything we were told about this place was true. It's a bit of a hole in the wall, but I LOVE that and the food certainly did not disappoint.While I was a bit upset at myself for not remembering more of my Spanish, it was easy enough to communicate with our waitress by pointing things out on the menu. I ordered three chicken tacos and my husband ordered a chicken burrito. We were not offered any chips and salsa, but after reading Steph H.'s review, I can see why...we should have known to ask! (To be remedied in the future!) My tacos were OUT OF THIS WORLD! The cilantro, crispy smoky chicken pieces, onions, fresh lime and small corn tortillas were the perfect combination of yumminess! So fresh and light tasting...I could have had three more! At $1.25 a piece, that wouldn't be hard to afford either! My husband's burrito was delicious as well. I was surprised to see they used sliced avocado in it and you had to specify cheese. He couldn't finish it all as it's a good portion for only $5! We also shared a glass (as big as your head) of their horchata and it was delightful! Only $3 and we had to take it to go as well.The place smells amazing and the ambiance is very casual. There were about 10 TVs (exaggeration) playing the same soap opera and I wasn't quite sure of the necessity of that many TVs. Oh well.

My husband and I have been going here for about a year now and we have not once been disappointed. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food, El Tapatio is all you need.For those who have only experienced Tex-Mex/Americanized Mexican food, the fare offered at El Taptio might initially seem surprising. The food is not slathered in thick/heavy sauces, nor does it contain very much cheese and sour cream is non-existent here. What you get instead is food that is incredibly fresh and very hearty, but never heavy. The tacos are akin to the ones you would get at the various taco carts around town: two grilled corn tortillas about the size of the palm of your hand filled with onions, cilantro, and the meat of your choice. Sounds simple, but it's so good! My favorite tacos are the lengua (tongue!) and the tripa (tripe!) - if you think you can't stomach stomach, think again! The tripe here is crispy nuggets of pure deliciousness. Still, if you'd like something a little less exotic, you can't go wrong with some spicy pork or the chorizo (the latter isn't listed on the menu, but you can ask for it and they usually have it). If you're looking for something more substantial the tortas (sandwiches) and burritos are super filling and very reasonable at just $5. I love the birria burrito (goat stew), but again, you can get any of the more conventional offerings like chicken, steak, or pork. The burritos come packed with rice, beans and avocado along with your meat, while the sandwiches have the same fixin's as the burritos plus lettuce, tomato and melted cheese. If you come with more than two people they tend to automatically bring out chips with salsa and guacamole--all for free!--but if they don't you can always ask for them to bring you some. The salsas that they bring out are smokey (the red one) and picante (the green one) and very good. Your tastebuds will quiver in delight since it's unlikely that you've ever tasted restaurant salsa that has this much flavor. You can also order beer, various softdrinks (including Mexican varieties), but you definitely need to try the horchata (rice water with a healthy dash of cinnamon). It's so tasty and will help you deal with any spice overload.It's true that Spanish is definitely the preferred language here, but don't let that dissuade you because many of the waitresses do speak enough English to get your order right. The food is so good that a little pantomiming is definitely worth it!

Terrible communication. No leadership, no one took responsibility, no one made it right. Terrible experience.My bride and I booked the private room at 360 Bistro months in advance for our small wedding reception. We had been there previously to try it out, and their food and service were top notch (if exorbitantly expensive), so we thought it would be a sure thing.Let me start by saying, anyone who has ever been married or planned a wedding knows that there is so much that goes into it. So much planning, so much money, and when things don't go right it can be heartbreaking. Thus begins the tale of our experience at 360 Bistro.About a month out from the wedding, my bride calls 360 to just make sure everything is still good to go. They inform us that the person we had been dealing with no longer works there and they have no idea what we are talking about. So we showed the the correspondence between us and them and they agreed to honor the terms. It seemed like crisis was averted. Fast forward to the night of the wedding.We arrive post-ceremony to find that they had booted us out of the private room. No call, no email, no communication of any kind. They not only did not have us set up in the private room, they put us back in the corner in the server's prep area. They didn't even have enough tables or chairs set up. So here we are, us and our wedding guests wondering what in the heck is happening. Immediately we begin to ask what is going on. The manager never came to us to talk to us. She simply ignored that we were there. The wait staff tried desperately to cover, but they knew it was wrong. They stuffed us in to this tiny corner where I didn't even have enough room to pull the chair out for my bride to sit down.Appetizers were already supposed to be prepared (we specifically asked and had someone come early to make sure they were ordered), they weren't. So all of us had to wait for those. The food was delicious as we knew it would be and the servers, while it appeared that they had never been to a wedding or hosted any sort of party there ever, did an admirable job with the debacle. On top of all of the aforementioned gaffes, they informed us that they would be charging us $2.50 PER SLICE of our own wedding cake that we brought which was not previously disclosed to us. They then proceeded to take the cake without even asking us and cut it into GIANT pieces. This was a cake made to serve 40-50 people. They cut it into 20 slices. Hundreds of dollars down the drain as no one could finish their cake. To top it off, they did not leave any for my bride and I to have! Imagine having to console your new wife who is in tears over all this, and not a manager in sight to even apologize for confusion.To end the night we asked for some satisfaction. We were told succinctly that we would not be receiving any sort of discount and were required to pay the full price. After the huge amount of money we spent, one would think we would get at least an apology from the manager. We did not.As you might imagine, I will not be patronizing their establishment again and will actively encourage others to dine elsewhere.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 10 reviews", "date": "2015-05-05"}, {"rating": "1.0", "name": "\nRachel S.\n", "review": "\"We basically paid over 100 dollars for French fries and wine.\" That is all.

He had ordered the tempura-battered shrimp tacos, but swapped the shrimp for fish, as suggested by the menu. Surprisingly, the fish was not tempura breaded. Even more surprisingly, it was PUTRID.

For appetizers, there were four that we wanted to try. \u00a0We finally decided on the tuna tartar and the calamari. \u00a0The tuna was beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. \u00a0If I were into taking pictures of food, this one was picture worthy. \u00a0The calamari was a standard fried calamari. \u00a0It was nicely cooked, not too chewy, and the remoulade was outstanding.As an entree, I had the tri tip, which was served with bone marrow, sauteed rapini, and a chimichurri. \u00a0The steak itself was perfectly medium rare and with the proper chew expected from the cut of meat. \u00a0The gelatinous part of the marrow didn't add much to the dish, but the rendered marrow fat had great flavor, and tied all of the other components together. \u00a0The rapini was slightly bitter, which went well with the other components of the dish.My wife had a grouper special. \u00a0I was a little surprised to hear another server present the fish as halibut to a table behind us. \u00a0When the dish was presented, there was no mistaking that it was grouper instead of halibut. The fish was well prepared, and went well with the reduction that accompanied the dish. \u00a0This was a fine dish, but probably not something we'd order again.The desserts may have been the best part of the meal. \u00a0I had a vanilla panna cotta with strawberry sauce. \u00a0My wife had the warm chocolate cake with salted caramel and \u00a0espresso ice cream. \u00a0If it wouldn't have cause a scene, I think it's safe to say that we would've licked our plates.The service was prompt and friendly. Our server was nice and conversational, but not too over bearing. She was also very comfortable making recommendations off the extensive wine list, which is presented on and Ipad app.Overall, we enjoyed our experience. \u00a0It was a nice change of pace from the other locations that we typically celebrate special occasions. \u00a0 When a friend asked my opinion after the meal, I told them that 360 would be a great place to drink wine, and nosh on a variety of the wonderful appetizers and desserts.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 68 reviews", "date": "2014-07-30"}, {"rating": "1.0", "name": "\nZoey B.\n", "review": "Horrible waited 2 hours for a burger.

I'm not sure what cut of meat it was, but it was grainy and impossible to cut with the steak knife I was never given. On top of that the rest of the accoutrement was inedibly under spiced. Finally, the kitchen ran out of the dessert item we ordered at the beginning of the meal and we were never told until the end of the meal when they brought out the other options and just dropped them on the table. Don't get me started on how they failed with my girlfriends meal. In addition the cocktails we both ordered were poorly mixed. Over all I was incredibly disappointed.

First, I don't mind paying a little more for good food; my wife and I like do that every so often, to splurge a little on ourselves. We're not rich and can't do it much, so we seek out places that have strong reviews. That's why we went to 360 Bistro: the reviews are good. The thing is, the restaurant didn't live up to the reviews. Here's why. First, when I pay a hundred bucks for a meal, I have certain expectations. One is that the food will taste good. Bistro 360 lived up to that expectation; the food quality was good. Not excellent, not even very good. But it was good. The problem with the food was the quantity. I don't expect huge portions in expensive restaurants; it's a given that you sacrifice quantity for quality (while paying more, though some restaurants, i.e. Sunset Grill, accomplish both). I ordered the steak of the day. It was a flat iron steak, which I don't think is a 5-star restaurant cut of beef. Honestly, it's what I'd expect at at good Mexican restaurant. The beef had a nice tendon right down the middle and was not as tender as I expect in an entree at that price. But it wasn't the cut of beef that was disappointing. It was the sides. It came with potatoes, squash, and zucchini. I had two one-inch slices of potato, and maybe four or five each of the squash and zucchini. And the side wasn't all that good. My wife ordered the fish of the day, marlin \"caught off the coast of Ecuador\" (an extraneous explanation that I honestly thought was a bit pretentious). It was good, very tender, and she had a larger portion than I did; her eggplant side, however, was mushy and over cooked. But all of that is only worth a one-star deduction. The other star comes from the wine. I like good wine. My wife loves to taste good wine. Unfortunately their Merlot we ordered was old and stale, and at $12 a glass that simply shouldn't be the case. It tasted like something from a $12 bottle of wine and was a big disappointment, particularly in a restaurant with such an extensive wine list and strong reputation in that area. But I've seen this in other restaurants with big wine lists: the wines don't get drunk as quickly, and it's very easy to have a bottle go stale, which was the case with our wines. Overall the experience was okay. We had no reservation (we went because the power was out at our house and we went on a whim) and the staff accommodated that (granted, it was a Thursday night, but they still made room for us). The waiter was very professional and service was excellent. Unlike a lot of places, Bistro 360 is made for conversation; it is an easy place to sit and talk, and I never felt as though I was being rushed through my meal. It wasn't noisy despite the crowd, and the decor was very nice. Bottom line: it was a good place to eat, but simply not worth the money. I've heard that it's a good place to go at happy hour, and they have a good reputation for wine tastings.

I made reservations at 7 pm on a Friday, but when we arrived, our table was not available, and we were told it would be about 10 minutes. After a quick trip to Harris Teeter next door, our table was ready, and our waiter greeted us with a couple of complimentary glasses of champagne to make up for the wait, which was certainly a nice touch.Because they rotate their wine list regularly, the off-going wines are reduced in price, so we ordered a 2003 Summit Lake Vineyards Howell Mtn Zinfandel off of that list, which was fabulous.The soups of the day were both chilled: a potato-leek and golden beet soup. Neither my H nor I are big soup people, but they sounded delicious, so I ordered the golden beet, and he got the potato-leek. The golden beet soup was very mild and the presentation was beautiful. Little swirled bits of red beet gathered in the center adding some color and bite. My H loved his potato-leek soup as well.For our entrees, I ordered the fish of the day: yellowfin tuna with spring ramps and fiddlehead ferns. The tuna was cooked perfectly. It was probably about 1 1/2 inches thick with a light sear on the outside and almost cool on the inside. I could cut through it like butter, and it was rich and fatty on my tongue. It came with the most complex, delicious sauce which appeared to be made of honey, wasabi or horseradish, and cilantro. The ramps and fiddlehead ferns were a nice accompaniment, and the presentation was beautiful. With every bite, I just wanted to close my eyes and let all the flavors wash over me.H ordered the rabbit, with the meat falling off the bone. It was the most tender rabbit I had ever had. The pieces of rabbit were arranged with some mushrooms, baby carrots, and small onions.We couldn't stop there so we ordered dessert. I ordered the trio of sorbets: mango, blood orange, and blackberry-yuzu. It also came with mini-madeleines, which were tough and chewy; the only downside of our meal. The blood orange sorbet was my favorite, very tart with a hint of sweetness.H picked the Granny Smith Apple and Bacon Fritters. They came out smelling like funnel cake, and the bacon added just a hint of smokiness and maple flavor.The service was perfect. We were in no rush and let our server know that we wanted to take our time and enjoy our wine. The pacing was ideal.

For example, owners, please sweep and wipe up tables before sitting down in the dining room to eat your own meal. Customers deserve to eat in a clean place. Use real kalamata olives, and real lettuce cut by hand, not dried out iceberg in a bag and put out a real, flavorful cucumber yogurt sauce. And warm the pita bread up on the flat top or grill.

Alexanders. \u00a0Although the sign said \"OPEN\" it looked pretty empty but I went on in. \u00a0It wasn't just empty, I was literally the ONLY PERSON THERE! \u00a0It was like eating at a restaurant after the end of the world...I'm the only survivor! \u00a0In their defense, I didn't show up for lunch until 1:45pm so I don't think it is all their fault - I just eat at off times on the weekends.So let's say that the service was attentive and excellent since I was the only patron. \u00a0I got to sit where I wanted, I got my water promptly, and the waitress helped me choose between two things. \u00a0I can't remember the official name of what I got but it had stir fried onions, green bell peppers, carrots, and baby corn in a brown sauce. \u00a0You have the option of mild, medium, hot, or Native Thai spice and I ordered it hot. \u00a0It comes with rice to soak up the sauce. \u00a0So I was extremely pleased with the food that came out. \u00a0The veggies were so fresh, crisp, and tasted so good with the perfectly hot sauce. \u00a0The heat was hot, burn your mouth, but not burn your mouth so hot you can't taste anything else. \u00a0I really enjoyed this dish and almost wished there were more to enjoy (oink oink!!). \u00a0I also liked the fact that since the place was empty I could eat in peace and read my kindle to my hearts content. \u00a0Not too shabby. \u00a0Prices for the entrees were a little bit on the high side considering it was lunch and I was alone but it was really tasty enough that I didn't care at all.I am pleased to find this easy to get to, easy to park at, delicious to eat at Thai restaurant so close to my house. \u00a0I will definitely be back when I get the craving for Thai food - and I suspect my cravings will occur more frequently now!!", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 1027 reviews", "date": "2011-07-31"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nKalpesh P.\n", "review": "One of the best Thai food I had in Nashville.

The \u00a0fried spring rolls are light and flavorful with a delightful sweet sauce for dipping.Portions are comfortably sized with plenty of fresh ingredients. The veggies have obviously not been soaking in the sauces, so they keep their crunch and add layers of flavor to their individual dishes.

There was about half as much of it as expected (or as compared to other places with similar prices), It was cut into tiny cubes, and it wasn't quite as well cooked as I would have liked it.

Goozy gets it right with solely focusing on sweets for that late night crave. I love that they also have a small food menu if you're more than just dessert-hungry. Also, I thought they wouldn't have any cocktails since they opened up only a few weeks ago, but I was proven wrong. Their sippable menu actually looks solid. I know that Goozy still has some kinks to work out. I definitely want to come back and try their other desserts and hopefully when I do, things will be smoother and I will post an updated review at that time.So for my experience here... I drove in to the parking lot and saw the huge billboard sign that was lit up with \"Goozy.\" Super cool. BUT. Under its name, it said \"coming soon\" so that sort of confused me since I knew it had already opened for at least a few weeks. I loved the interior, atmosphere, and the menu design. However, one thing I noticed about the menu was that there was a heck lot of chocolate treats. I'm more of a berry/fruit/vanilla kind of gal and the night I went I wasn't quite feeling chocolate so my choices were left to four options under the specialty desserts. All the Goozy cakes were chocolate cakes, so I felt a bit left out in that area. I'm not quite sure if Goozy cakes are supposed to all be dark chocolate molten cakes (?). I ended up ordering the Pot de Creme with a side of Cinnamon gelato. This is when I started feeling a bit uneasy about things here. I ordered this mainly because the menu said it comes with \"fresh berry compote.\" I wanted this for the berries (!!!!). I finally got my order and ... no berries :(. I thought it might have been tucked inside the custard, but no. All I got was chocolate custard and the cream on top in a small cup and my gelato. 1. the gelato was fantastic, 2. the custard itself was not too sweet (just how I like it), but a bit thicker than I expected, and 3. no berries :(((((((. I politely asked the server whether I was supposed to receive berries with my order and she went back and checked for me. She ended up bringing me a small side of the berry compote (I really liked it!!! Could only taste sugar from the fruit, so nicely done) and saying that the menu was printed wrong and the fresh berry compote was supposed to be for the item above. I looked back on the menu and the item above Pot de Creme is the Crostata. I'm pretty sure the Crostata isn't supposed to be eaten with fresh berry compote... So not really sure what happened here.Something else I'm confused about - I read an earlier review here in which a scoop of gelato was added to the S'mores order for only $1. When I ordered my gelato along with my specialty dessert, I paid $3 for that addition. What is correct since I didn't see anything written out on the menu about adding gelato for just $1? :(((((My partner ordered the Raspberry goozy cake which we both liked. Also ordered amaretto gelato which was SO YUMMY. Overall, good service, ambiance, and gelato flavors. For a dessert cafe, though, I did expect a lot more out of my specialty dessert since I felt like I paid $6 for a small custard cup of plain chocolate cream. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing or the most boring dessert item. Anyhow, I want to come back, try the skillet cookie and eat more gelato. I'm hoping they'll have these little issues I pointed out solved by then.", "location": "\nMemphis, TN\n", "exp": " 81 reviews", "date": "2015-01-04"}, {"rating": "1.0", "name": "\nMegan K.\n", "review": "WARNING LONG POST AHEAD! :-) Our night was a disaster. Much to our dismay our group of 7 could've made out better eating at the Wendy's next door than dining at Goozy. Arrived at 6:30pm for a friend's bday celebration and a couple minutes in two ladies sitting next to us whispered in my friends ear that they hoped we would actually get our food tonight. Apparently they ordered a cheese plate, drinks (which one of the ladies asked for a refill on her wine that never came) and they also ordered dessert and THAT never came, so they left. Now stay with me it gets better!We started to worry, and was it warranted! Our sandwiches took 40 minutes for us to get. Sandwiches. A Tuesday night. One of my friends orders was wrong (it happens) and she had to wait another 20 minutes for a BLTC with no cheese! How hard is it to put together such a thing? And another warning: do not get a side salad instead of chips bc all it is-is a spring mix with dressing drizzled on it.... No tomatoes, no cheese, not a single crouton, just lettuce. For a 2 dollar up charge! I would've much rather stuck with the chips and just not have eaten them which is basically what I did with the salad. And my friend and I both ordered the BLTC and there was no \"L\" on either of ours.... No one had much to say about their dinners. Honestly nothing special. Oh and we ordered dessert in the middle of eating bc we knew we'd have to wait... We didn't get our desserts until after 8. Most of them were good. The lemon pudding one was our least favorite. I only ordered gelato... As I was getting near the bottom there was a HUGE long piece of straight hair in it that I coincidentally was pulling out of my mouth as the server came up to our table. Thankfully our server handled that well and didn't charge me for it.The bread pudding came out with no gelato or syrup on it so we had to track down someone to ask for that. It was just a mess. How do you forget two main ingredients on a dessert at a place known for desserts? It's a small place and the tables became full after we ordered yet we were the last ones to get anything. Just seemed very disorganized. Our waitress was nice and apologetic to us after one of my friends finally spoke up bc not only did we wait on our food, but we waited forever for our checks. It was just one disaster after another. To make things go a little quicker we decided to each go up one by one to the counter and pay for our meal individually. Another friend was up there and the waitress was ringing her up; meanwhile, the manager (we didn't know she was the manager) asked how everything was- my friend just said \"ok\" then proceeded to talk to the waitress who was again apologizing... My friend was saying to the waitress that it was just a shame bc we had high hopes for the place. Then the manager got snippy with my friend saying- \"Wait a minute, you just told me everything was ok and now you're saying it wasn't?! I need to know these things....\" Not sure what else was said exactly, but she was rude to my friend and did not show good customer service. Sorry for the long post! So much went on that I just had to get it all out :) it's safe to say that we will not be returning to Goozy.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 6 reviews", "date": "2015-04-22"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nChris P.\n", "review": "Pros: desserts are excellent, open until later than most placesCons: overpriced for small portions, very cramped environment", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 5 reviews", "date": "2015-05-28"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nCoco D.\n", "review": "I had the Artichoke Goat Cheese with sun dried tomatoes.

All of the sauces were delicious and I liked that papadum wasn't overly filling the way bread is (I tend to get almost full on bread at American restaurants and not have as much room for the main course).Garlic naan--I ordered a basket of garlic naan which came with 3 pieces. Great flavor of garlic and herbs and a good price at $2.50Shrimp bhagari--I was trying to decide between two shrimp dishes and the waiter recommended the shrimp bhagari. Definitely a good choice--it was a creamy, tomato sauce that was slightly sweet and tangy. I'm generally not a huge fan of Indian because I find a lot of the different curries to be overwhelming in the use of different spices and have a muddled flavor profile but this dish was more up my alley. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and despite being in this sauce full of Indian spices, the shrimp stilled retained its sweet, shrimpy quality. All of the entrees come with basmati rice which went perfectly with the entree.They have a heat scale of 1-10 and I ordered mine a 3 which ended up not being spicy at all. I tried my friend's dish which was a 9 and that it wasn't insanely hot as I thought it would be. If you want some actual heat, I would recommend ordering something higher than a 5. Mango lassi--what can I say, I've never had a bad mango lassi and this was no exception. I like that they put ice in theirs as I've had practically room temperature mango lassi at Sitar (the other Indian place near Vanderbilt) before.Price:This place is definitely on the pricey side--the dishes are in the $13 to $20 range and the portions are fairly small. My shrimp dish was $15.95 and came out in this small copper dish in this special holder with a candle under it. I wish there had more pieces of shrimp (I think had 6-8 pieces) as it was mostly sauce. However, despite the small portion, you do end up being pretty full because you eat it with the rice. So I didn't leave the meal hungry by any means but it did feel like I paid mostly for rice.Service:Very friendly wait staff. When we asked for more papadum the waiter said \"no problem, I'll bring that right to you\" but are food came just a couple minutes after and I guess he forgot about the papadum but no biggie. Otherwise, they were super friendly and informed us that the rice was complimentary and unlimited so when we were low on rice and asked for more, they brought out more right away.Environment/Ambience:The decor was that of your typical old-school Indian restaurant. The place was pretty clean and they wiped our plates with how towels right before placing them in front of us which I appreciate because I've been to plenty of Chinese/other Asian restaurants that using super dirty dishes and silverware.*Overall positive experience, despite being a bit price I would definitely come back because practically all the Indian restaurants in the area are around the same price range.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 2 reviews", "date": "2015-01-18"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nLoralyn D.\n", "review": "Great lunch buffet! \u00a0Lots of options, good food, quick and easy.", "location": "\nHendersonville, TN\n", "exp": " 99 reviews", "date": "2015-01-29"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nSteve W.\n", "review": "I love Indian cuisine & don't know why it took me so long to visit this place but I am so pleased I did.

The food is always delicious, from the complimentary pappadam with chutneys and raita at the beginning to the mango lassi a creamy, fruity cold drink which in my opinion is best saved for dessert.My favorites on the menu are many: if you are looking to avoid the calories that come with the delectable sauces, definitely go for the chicken tikka, flavorful and bright red from the yogurt marinade, tender and juicy from the tandoori oven. Served sizzling with onion and peppers, it is a guilt-free choice that leaves you sated. If you aren't counting calories, amp up the volume and go for the chicken tikka masala, served in a spicy, creamy, fiery red (in color only, unless you specify otherwise) sauce. The korma is excellent. Your choice of protein served in a rich, nut-based sauce perfumed with spice. The vindaloo is also delicious, as are the saag paneer, madras, and most other items you might choose. The only time I ever had anything that was less than wonderful was when I ordered a broiled chicken dish that was flavored with mint and other spices.

Mainly, the food was lukewarm and stale. The cauliflower fritters were probably pretty good right after coming out of the fryer but the batter was kind of soft and tough by the time I got to them, which was only mid-way through the lunch service.The cucumber salad was a large bin of shredded iceberg lettuce with about 4 thin cucumber slices left. There was apparently no intention to replenish that, as I made three passes and it looked just as sparse and sad as the first time around. (Come on, all you had to do was slice up like TWO cucumbers.)That was one of the most depressing restaurant meals I've ever had, second only to takeout from Satay Thai Grill the night before. In both cases, it wasn't due to lack of vegan selections, but rather, the mediocre quality of preparation.

I have always loved Bombay's use of the dish-warmers at the table, and I've found that I can actually get my dishes prepared to the 10+ spice level I enjoy. The curry entree portions are reasonable -- though the price can be a bit high for some of the vegetarian dishes -- but it's a price I'm willing to pay for the food I enjoy so much.Now, the bad news. The service is still just inattentive enough to prevent one from fully enjoying the food. Here's what I mean. First, when we arrived, our water glasses were filled when we were handed menus, but we didn't see our server again for at least 10 minutes -- when he came to ask if we were ready to order our entrees. \u00a0So we didn't have an opportunity to order drinks or appetizers -- and Indian restaurants are one of the few places that I really enjoy ordering both. This isn't a big problem, but for me it is one contributing difference between 4 stars and 5 stars in the service department.We had the same problem when we received our entrees. I had dinner with two other adults, and when our food first came out, we received only one small plate of rice. No problem, it was just enough for each of us to get a couple of spoonfuls to start our dinner.But it was quite some time before we saw our server again so that we could ask for more rice, which left us awkwardly picking at our plates for a bit. We were then brought another small plate of rice (essentially the same amount of rice that is provided to a single person dining alone), which we again quickly demolished among the three of us. \u00a0We wouldn't see our server again until it was time to leave, so we never really had enough rice to enjoy our meal.Similarly, when we asked for to-go boxes, we received no additional rice. Almost every other Indian restaurant I've frequented either brings rice in the to-go boxes or asks if we would like more. So among three adults who ordered three different curry entrees (one for the table to share) and one tandoori entree, we only received a two small dishes of rice.In general, the portion sizes are good, though I was a little disappointed with the size of my Tandoori Special Dinner. I typically find the combination dinners to be extremely generous and far more food than one person can eat, which justifies the high price. However, for $17.95 I received a small-ish tandoori chicken leg and thigh, four small (inch and a half long or so) pieces of lamb and chicken kebab, one large shrimp/prawn in the center of the plate (about the size of a small onion ring), and about 6 chunks of chicken tikka. This was served on a small bed of lettuce and was accompanied by a bowl of raita, naan, and the aforementioned rice.It was delicious food, but I won't order that particular entree again. I think the size would be perfect (for the cost) if it came with a curry or vegetable accompaniment. Similarly, the masala tea always ends up being extremely overpriced because the cup is a very small serving and I've never been offered a refill or another cup. I'm not sure if this is a factor of the inattentive service or if the tea is meant to be a no-refills item, but it's a lot to spend for the small cup of tea.One positive note about the service, though. I do prefer the relaxed, leisurely atmosphere of Bombay Palace to that of Sitar. Once you are seated at Bombay Palace, you do feel as though you're allowed to enjoy your dinner and have a good conversation with your dinner companions. At Sitar, though I find the food to be equally good, I always feel that they are trying to turn tables much more quickly, so I have often received the check and to-go boxes within 10 minutes of receiving my entree. This is honestly a bit funny, to me, since Sitar has far more room for diners than Bombay Palace, but I've always felt rushed there.So I do enjoy the relaxed pace of Bombay -- I just wish that the service were more attentive when it comes to ensuring that diners have the rice and drinks they need.We will keep going back, but still with the expectation that the service will be a bit lacking and the food a bit overpriced.", "location": "\nOld Hickory, TN\n", "exp": " 5 reviews", "date": "2014-01-18"}, {"rating": "5.0", "name": "\nDarlene O.\n", "review": "THIS restaurant is the reason why I love Indian food!

We were given a flatbread with four sauces. Bpmbay offeres a few but good Indian beers. We had the Kingfisher and Haywards 5000 that were served and poured in the appropriate glass. We ordered the vegetable pakora which is inexpensive and delicious. Each different vegetable seemed to be battered with the same mix but cooked longer than the other giving it a slightly different texture. The garnish of iceberg lettuce and green pepper did not add to the dish. We ordered the lamb boti kabob masala, lamb pasanda, and the onion and cheese paneer. The entrees were served in neat chaffing dishes which kept them warm throughout dinner. The long grain rice was cooked perfectly. The menu states the lamb is tender and it was very tender. Our requested spiciness level was spot on. The pasanda was sweet and savory and the masala was tangy and creamy. The manage ice-cream tasted fresh and was a bright dessert. The fruit custard was garnished with candied fruit and minced pistachio. The portions were perfect. In summary the prices were surprisingly low for the quality of the food and the service. The manager even came by to check on us and say hello. My only criticism is that the decor could use an little work and the booths rock back and forth if you sit back in them.

And I have to say that for the second time in a row, Nashville hits it out of the park for the quality of Indian food I've had thus far. \u00a0I've been to Woodlands and was quite enthralled by the amount of spices used. But Woodlands is vegetarian and I like my meat, so going to Bombay Palace up the street was a must.For starters, we had the papadams and an array of 4 dips: Green, red, orange, and brown. Sorry, that's the best I can do identify them. They were alternatively spicy and sweet and hot. There is probably a dip that you will like. The papadams were spicy, a version of which I admittedly have never had at restaurants back home. They were always bland.Before we moved here, I had discovered lamb at Afghan restaurants and fell in love. I now make it a point to have lamb anywhere and everywhere it's offered. I had the lamb pasanda here, and it was heavenly. And spicy. Oh so spicy. That's something else I've learned while in Nashville: \"Mild\" is probably considered \"medium hot\" where I'm from. But I'm also a wimp when it comes to spicy food.The last few Indian places I tried back home were very disappointing -- when I asked for mild, the dishes were completely devoid of spices. At Bombay Palace, I saw the cinnamon, the cumin, the cardamom, etc., in my dishes.The pasanda came with a rice pilaf / biryani, which was my only slight disappointment. I like rice by itself, but I didn't think to ask how this dish was going to be served. And in Indian restaurants, I like rice flavored with the usual spices. But give me the fancy rice which can become a meal on its own, then I think it's an overload of flavors, especially with spicy meat. I loved this dish, but when (and there will be a when) I come back, I will see if I can have this with plain Indian rice.The only suggestion I can make about this place: Lose the suit and (bow?) tie for your servers. Considering my introduction to this fine city was the intense humidity, I felt uncomfortable seeing them in this getup, even though the place is well air-conditioned.

Accompanied with rice and Naan Bread, the Tandoori Chicken fell of the bone, and the Chicken Tikka Massala, though different than what I'm used to, was equally as tasty.

However endearing it was to watch the confusion over what table was getting what, their plates always came out quickly and their wait staff was exceedingly friendly.

I travel a ton, and I've had Indian everywhere from California to Washington DC to London. I'm pretty familiar with the full spectrum of Indian food, so I can tell you what makes this place stand out to me.1) Service: this usually doesn't top my list when it comes to restaurants, but the manager in particular makes such a wonderful effort. Even though I don't go too often, and there are often multi-month lags between my visits, he still seems to recognize me when I come in. That's pretty incredible.2) Flavors: one problem some Indian places have is that so many of the dishes taste the same. The spectrum from butter chicken to tikka masala to curry to vindaloo should have distinct flavors. At Bombay Palace, it does.3) Meat quality: one shortcut that drives me nuts at some places is serving inferior meat quality. You notice this most with lamb, where you'll get chunks with fat or gristle. Sometimes, you'll get pieces of dark meat chicken in your curry too. I know some people like the latter, but not me. The meat quality has always been very good.I've had excellent luck at the buffet as well as at dinner. The naan is cooked well and is flavorful. The butter chicken at buffet time doesn't taste like it's been sitting out forever, a nice change of pace from other buffets.My favorite dish here, hands-down, is the chicken mango. Ask for it spicy, and you'll get a wonderful sweet-and-spicy flavor that's unique. A couple other \"standard\" Indian dishes that this place does well are the chicken korma and the lamb vindaloo. I ask for the vindaloo extra extra spicy, and while it probably is just that for ordinary people, it's never quite spicy enough for me. The makhani chicken and chicken tikka masala are just OK; for some reason, they lack the richness of flavor that I find at some other Indian restaurants.If you're in the downtown area and craving Indian, I can't think of a better place to tell you to go.

That was in the evening and we ordered off the menu... no buffet at night. The food was better than good, the wine selection good, the beers unusual and delightful. The desserts were subtle and memorable. My wife and I had a fabulous time. Then we returned today for a late Sunday lunch and the buffet was the only option. But something was wrong. Very wrong. And it made for a most unpleasant experience. I believe that it's an attitude and organization problem. I'll explain:In the evening, you have a host to greet and seat you. You have a waiter assigned to your table. There's a food runner. The service is attentive, anticipatory, and gracious. And the food is divine. Go in the evening, and you'll love it. But the daytime buffet... yeah, not so much.For whatever reason, there is no waiter assigned to any group of tables, so they all- every one- wander around and ignore the guests. The same folks who were charming in the evening are dismissive, harried and curt. Perhaps they feel that they won't receive the same tips during the buffet that they would receive at the dinner service. The way the staffing of the buffet is arranged, I'm certain that's true.There's a sign on the buffet sneeze guard in 72 pt. type telling diners that naan would be served at table. I couldn't help but be reminded of the shop owner with the \"restrooms for paying customers only!\" signs that one occasionally sees in a struggling convenience store. It wouldn't have been bad if the bread had arrived at any time before we were finished with our meal. Our drink order never arrived. In short, the buffet is quite limited and OK for flavor, with unbelievably bad service. Don't go while the sun shines. But if you can wait until the sun goes down, the place transforms into near perfection. They should really be closed during the day. A lunch place is a different animal from a dinner place... and you'll seldom see a better example than Bombay Palace.

It's a good way to feel spoiled on a tight budget.My gauges for Indian restaurants are typically: naan bread, onion chutney, and chicken tikka masala.

I was very pleased with the service, all of the servers were very polite and the owner actually walked around and spoke to the customers after their meals. It is a small hole-in-the-wall restaurant in a very nice area of Nashville. The inside is classy, yet relaxed and informal.We spent around $70 incl. tip for dinner. We decided on the combo dinner for two, it runs about $35. We also ordered two kingfisher beers at 7 bucks a piece, I \u00a0recommend their Indian wine. I can't remember the name of it but it was smooth, not too sweet and not too dry. A little pricey at $8 a glass, but it complimented the meal wonderfully.The combo came with a starter of pumpkin (?) soup, very flavorful. The main meal included chicken tikka, tandoori chicken, and a ground lamb type of kabob meat. The chicken was great, the lamb was interesting. The taste of the lamb took some getting used to, it was prepared a bit like meatloaf with fresh cilantro and mint leaves. \u00a0The tandoori chicken was delish of course. We ordered medium spicy, for the curries and that was pretty hot so beware of ordering too spicy here I was breaking a sweat, and I am definitely a Thai food regular. They veggie curry was great, they used fresh and crunchy ingredients which was greatly appreciated! I like my curry to have some texture. It was a bit cheesy, and a little hard to stomach but if you can handle the cream go for it. We also had some type of lamb curry, the cuts of lamb were spot-on. The meat was very tender and there were no scraps (i.e. fat/gristle). The naan was also delish, a bit crispy but still very buttery and tasty. We also ordered the raita (yogurt with cucumber) very good, but I usually like it a bit runny and theirs was very thick.For desert we ordered kheer, the sweet basmati rice pudding. I really liked the presentation with a little cinamon sprinkled on top along with some sliced almonds and a few raisins.

The problem was I ordered the tandoori chicken during evening hours after inquiring if it was breast meat and was assured that was the case.

Back to the table, food was arriving. Our waitress was very attentive to our needs checking back with us often. While we ate there was a local blue grass band playing tunes which was nice background music for our meal.

For instance, a steak comes with a carrot and choice of potato. When I ordered my steak he did not ask me how I wanted my potato prepared, and then served me a plate without a potato. When I politely asked why I was the only person without a potato, he got very rude and told me I never told him I wanted a potato. Seriously?

I am (unfortunately!) a carnivorous type and I love a good steak, filet being my favorite. Two gents and I had dinner at Bob's at my urging (it looks beautiful and enticing with its airy but alluringly dim seating and cracking fireplaces, as seen from across the road at the new music convention center). We didn't have reservations so we weren't able to sit in the fireplace-lit room (granted, we are talking the dead of a southern summer here), but we were luckily seated immediately in the bar area. The menu is your typical higher-price point steakhouse: steaks, potatoes, a la carte sides for sharing, salads, seafoods. We split an appetizer of the calamari, and while it was nothing profound (Bob's MIGHT have been a little more imaginative with the dipping option, a straight up marinara), it was tender and tasty and we three polished off the plate. (And I think Bob's serves bread, gratis, but we didn't get any - no biggie however).I wanted a bone-in filet, which isn't a regular menu offering but it was being offered as a special that night. Our server, a friendly and quick gal, noted it was a hefty one-pounder, so I opted for the slightly more conservative boneless 9-oz. filet, med-rare. The two guys also ordered steaks, which all came with perfectly cooked and bursting with fluffiness baked potatoes. And a carrot. We each got a huge, peeled, cooked carrot, tops lopped off, basted in brown-sugary butteriness. It was very pointedly phallic. I don't love cooked carrots or pointedly phallic objects, so I asked both of my dinner fellows if they'd like mine, one who deadpanned, \"no thanks, I have 10 inches of my own.\" I plopped the offending root onto the butter plate (really some people may love it, both of the guys did, I just really hate cooked carrots), and enjoyed my filet and spud. My filet was literally cooked to fork-tender perfection, hot juicy red interior with a perfectly seasoned, slightly charred exterior. Absolutely delicious and I shamelessly devoured the entire thick, densely-rich portion.The entire tab before tip was about $137, for 4 beers+3 steak entrees+calamari appetizer.

The onion rings could feed a army. They where very large and you get a lot of them. But they where lacking flavor. The batter was lacking flavor and tasted like it was cooked in the same oil as some sea food. Would not recommend them. The skillet potatoes I got with the gravy on the side, potatoes well done. I also ask for garlic to be added. They where the best skillet potatoes I've ever had at a restaurant. The bread that they bring you is very very messy and hard to cut without annihilating the loaf. It was average bread. The pickles and bell peppers they put at every table were ok. The blonde brownie was amazing. Two brownies with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and a scoop of peanut butter ice cream. Then it had nuts and whip cream and a cherry. They gave it to us for free because it was are anniversary.

When we inquired as to where the \"gelato\" hailed, the server advised he was unaware.

Unfortunately the restaurant told us they had lost the reservation? I am not sure how a restaurant losses reservations, but they did. We where all left to stand in the door way for over 40 minutes, until somebody decided to say something. The management reacted by buying us all a drink, which was nice. We had to wait over an hour before we where sat at a make shift table, which was three round tables placed together. This was most uncomfortable and inconvenient. The restaurant was obviously under staffed, and for a Saturday evening was a very poor show. The young ladies did everything they could to take care of us, but as they also had many other customers, the evening went from bad to worse! The manager seemed more interested in a pretty blond lady sat over in his bar area. The food order was a mess, incorrect food coming out, food orders wrong, everybody eating at different times. I actually did not eat, as my friends told me how poor the quality of the food was. Such a shame that the management of this new restaurant is so bad, as the place itself looks nice.

I also think they fry their food well - egg rolls aren't soggy with grease, fried chicken dishes are made to order and not pre-fried.I have one gripe: I am not a fan of their spice scale. They do tend towards the bland side of spicy, which means you should request more spice if you're into it. I don't blame them, I blame Nashville for that one.

The server mentioned that the bacon is pre-cooked but that they could \"nuke\" it to make it crispy. When my meal came out, the bacon was floppy... The server asked if it was crispy enough as I was picking it off the sandwich. I told her it wasn't, and she offered to have them \"nuke\" it again, but I told her I didn't want to have to wait to eat my meal. She said, \"Ok. Let me know if you change your mind. You're paying for the bacon.\" Not really sure why she couldn't just charge me for the regular pimento cheese sandwich since that's what I ended up eating, but I wasn't going to argue over a couple dollars.

Charleston She Crab soup and chicken salad on a croissant. Heaven I tell you, heaven! If you haven't checked this place out yet, you're seriously missing out.

You have to go up front and pay which is fine but usually, the patrons in line are slowly picking out different desserts to purchase at the same time. There's only one cashier, usually the same lady. I don't know her name but she always seems down or unhappy. Which is always frustrating because the servers are usually very sweet and helpful. 2.

I really enjoyed the cute little reclaimed wooden frames scattered throughout with glass inside and then hand written words on the glass (that can be changed all the time).

Well, Matter of Taste has taken care of that for you and drizzled the glorious cheesy mixture atop the chips for you.

My wife ordered pancakes and bacon. The gritty texture was even more pronounced in the pancakes. They were dry and not flavorful. There were only 2 slices of bacon, one of which was almost all fat. I ordered the southwestern omelet. It was supposed to have salsa, but there was none. No one asked us how the food was so I didn't get a chance to ask for some once I realized it was missing. Perhaps the worst part was the avocado with the omelet. It was too hard and rubbery to stick a fork into, let alone eat. That omelet never should have left the kitchen with avocado like that. I would have been much more understanding if they'd just told me they didn't have avocado. But to put that on a plate and try to call it food was laughable. Then, with our food barely touched, the server offered us a box and when we declined she simply brought the check. It was clear we didn't like our food but they didn't bother to ask us why.

They seem to get progressively worse. At first the nachos and bruschetta were great. The second time the fried chicken was not so great. Third time, the tomato basil soup was tasteless and the chicken salad sandwich was horrendous. you need to take some lessons from the sandwich bread used at Mitchells as well as giving a better portion of chicken salad instead of 3 big leaves of lettuce because you are pretty pricey. Tonight on October 10th, the squash and ginger soup was so thick that it looked like southern gravy and had chunks of uncooked squash in it. the Caesar salad I ordered had no croutons and I asked for an extra cheese biscuit and they gave me two slices of their hard as a rock sandwich bread. Case in point, I could have gone anywhere in order to order a Caesar without croutons, I love you little cheese biscuits substituting sandwich bread is ridiculous. So I call and tell them after I get home and realized how messed up my order is that I didn't get my cheese biscuits and there are no croutons on my Caesar salad as well as the texture of the soup. I would not even be writing this horrible review if the customer service was up to par. the girl who answer the phone could have cared less and told me to come back and get something else and that they were out of the cheese biscuits and that's why I got the sandwich bread.

Went with my family Friday night for my wife's birthday (she's GF). We were seated at a table immediately behind a couple. There was very little space between these two tables, and I could barely squeeze in without hitting the guy. (There were other tables that were open and well-spaced).Started with the hummus appetizer, knowing the four-year old would eat it. I guess it was a black bean hummus, though the menu just said \"hummus\". Not what any of us were expecting. And it was grainy. Not particularly good. They did bring some extra chips for it, though.My wife had ordered a salad with green goddess dressing. She took a bite with the dressing, and went wide-eyed. She asked me to taste it, because she thought it was dominated by raw garlic. So I put a bit to my tongue, and my entire mouth buzzed and burned. It was the exact sensation of holding a 9-volt battery to one's tongue. Raw garlic? Horseradish? Bad yogurt? No idea. Waitress said she'd bring a different dressing. No other acknowledgement when she came back. My wife had to ask if she or the kitchen tasted it, and she said she did, agreed something was wrong, and said the chef was working to fix it (whatever that meant). No apology, no explanation, nothing from the kitchen.For entrees, my wife ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and mashed potatoes. This was by far the best - and only good thing - any of us ordered. It was delicious, though the pesto (?) on it was unnecessary. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and the breading was very light. It would be wonderful for fried catfish.I ordered the special, prime rib (medium) with marscapone mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables. I don't know what was set before me, but it sure as hell wasn't prime rib, and it was gray throughout. No pink or red anywhere. Seriously, I have no idea what kind of steak that was. My mashed potatoes, and my wife's, were cold. We ordered the pizza for the four-year old, who loves pizza. She didn't care for it. None of us did. It was completely soggy except for the very edge of the crust. Hell, I make gluten-free pizza at home, Dominos can make a non-soggy gluten-free pizza, I don't know why this place can't. They should probably throw a plain pizza skin in the oven for a few minutes to set it and make it firm and crispy, then remove it and dress it out, then return it to the oven. I think the pizza would support the marinara much better if they did this.Very disappointing meal and service. Not quite sure what they're going for here. Casual? Dressy or semi-dressy? Hip?

Just 40+ people that kept a house in the city because the house on the River was flooded. Don't get me started. Remember the old faces from way back when, there were 2 of them, still as sweet and a few younger versions. All pretty speedy and nice and still a great place, but this time, there is a different vibe. A WE LOVE NASHVILLE vibe. We have seen this in a lot of places, but our little Star Bagel also has this. We still had a few tables to choose from and people are very nice. Reminded me of a coffee shop in DC or Philly. Nice people who just want a coffee and pastry. I am just incredulous how after this place has been around so long, how crazy crowded it finally has become. Have to add, last time I was here, was 2010, so 5 years later...Great place, great coffee, friendly FAST service and now with a new twist of lots people watching opps. Cannot say anything to the juices or smoothies. We have a Blendtec and Ninja so just cannot justify the spending.

Don't worry about them skimping on cream cheese, they definitely put on enough. They also had a variety of other baked goods, but I couldn't very well try Star Bagel Cafe and not eat a bagel.

I have been coming at least once a month for years now. So why 3 stars? Over the course of my visits I have experienced several things that make me cringe. 1) The owner is not very nice. I believe I read another review about a snarky email comment and the same thing has happened to me. I have also had a few things happen while visiting where the owner was beyond snarky to either me or another customer. I have also been scoffed at by an employee when I sent my bagel back because it was not made how I requested (I wanted the cream cheese spread on both sides of my To Go bagel rather than one and then closed). 2) The parking is awful as has been stated. I wish they would just move locations. 3) HYGIENE habits! There is a blonde woman who works there who is always there. She is really really nice and I like her a lot, BUT she wears her gloves non-stop. I've seen her smoke a cigarette outside with the gloves, take people's money, and then reach for a pastry in the same set of gloves. I have left before rather than risk having her touch my food with those gloves.

There's a variety of bagel sandwiches that are all under $4. \u00a0The bagels themselves aren't particularly special (they aren't NY style, if that's your thing), but they're totally fine.

When you walk inside, the left side has drinks and refrigerated pies and cakes, on the right side is all the different pastries in glass, self serve cabinets. You grab a tray and tongs and pick out what you want. The trays are the same you get at a fast food restaurant that usually have the white paper liner. These trays don't have liners, I guess they clean them, but I wished they had some kind of parchment paper to put the items on instead of directly on the tray. There is a huge selections of conchas, Mexican sweet breads, churros, oreja, and pan de colotes. I didn't know these names until I googled for them. They don't have any names or prices listed at the cabinet area. They don't even have prices listed up at the front counter. We picked 5 different items and the total after tax was $4.46. Not bad at all. The guy that bagged our stuff was nice, the guy that rung us up was on his phone and didn't say the total or the change or anything. Of the 5 items we got, my favorite was the concha.

The Huevos Avocado, English muffin, with poached (well) eggs, avacado which actually turned out to be guacamole, sour cream, and black beans in a cup. \u00a0Presentation on the plate was fair. \u00a0However first bite was luke warm. \u00a0I remember telling my wife throughout the entire meal that I really wish the food would have been hot.2. \u00a0The Pantry Feast- \u00a0two eggs soft scrambled, potatoes, bacon, and a \"crunch\" cake. \u00a0My wife first commented on the cold and limp bacon. \u00a0We both agreed that either warm and soft or cold and crunchy, but never cold and soft bacon. \u00a0The eggs were luke warm, the potatoes were lack luster. \u00a0No real seasoning. \u00a0The looked like they had come out of a Sysco frozen potato bag and put in the convection oven. \u00a0Unevenly done, some crispy and some soggy. \u00a0 The crunch cake was dry, like it had been under a heat lamp for quite some time.3. \u00a0Grilled Cheese- \u00a0My youngest daughter wanted something more lunchy, so she chose the grilled cheese, which was oddly grilled, but the cheese wasn't melted. \u00a0You could still see the edges of the american cheese slice, which normally should just be a gooey delight. \u00a0Same mediocre potatoes. \u00a0 We ate the meal, and when we left we said to ourselves we probably wouldn't come back and would stick with your tried and trued places.Now for the fun part. \u00a0After about 2 hours after eating, i began to feel a little queasy. \u00a0This meal was my only meal that day, so I just figured, it wasn't sitting well. \u00a0I continued to feel worse through the night, and then the diarrhea started and on going nausea which eventually lead to a four hour puking session. \u00a0I had to take a dose of nausea medication that a chemo patient would have to take, to eventually cause the vomiting to stop. \u00a0Seeing what I had for breakfast/lunch in front of me seven hours later pretty much determined the culprit.I frequent many establishments in this fair city that we call Nashville. \u00a0Each one that I goto I, TRUST, that they are following safe food handling practices, and I trust that cross contamination is mitigated at every chance. \u00a0This clearly is not the practice at this J.

It's like behind a gas station, but don't be put off by that. The place inside is great. The walls are filled with artwork and the mood lighting is very intimate. The staff was very friendly and attentive throughout our entire meal. I had the mozzarella sticks. I know it sounds pretty standard, but let me tell you: I was so happy that I ordered these. They were anything but basic. I can't put my finger on it, but there was something so delicious. There was something that made it taste like no other mozzarella stock I ever had. I think it may have been the blend of cheeses and the breading was different and very tasty. The free bread sticks are amazing. They are deliciously buttered and seasoned. The house sauce accompanied the bread. It was a delicious marinara like sauce. I ordered the chicken parmesan with spaghetti and the vegan bf ordered spaghetti with the house sauce and no cheese.The chicken parmesan was a big piece of chicken that was not dry at all. The crust and cheese that was on the chicken was very good. The cheese was perfectly melted and It all worked so well together. The pasta was perfectly done and the sauce was so good. I was happy that it was the same sauce that was served with the bread sticks. I couldn't finish it all. It was a large portion so I took some to the hotel. Luckily the hotel had a microwave... I had it for breakfast the next day. Don't judge me. Oh! Before I forget- talking with the staff I found out the chicken is organic. I told them they should put that on the menu since I think that's a great selling point. It made sense that it was organic though. I was full, but I didn't get the gross feeling of overeating and wanting to die. I just felt pleasantly plump. \u00a0The vegan said he liked his pasta alot and offered alot of flavor for such a simple dish. He was happy they adhered to his request of no cheese and that they were able to recite what ingredients were in his food to quell his nervousness of eating something he can't.

My boyfriend loves this restaurant and defended everything I said about it, but something's weren't really defendable. First off, it's really confusing because on the outside its super dingy and tiny and its next to a busy street and a gas station, so it's not the best location for this restaurant because it looks really nice on the inside. So as for the food, the main course wasn't as good as I was expecting for the price that it was. And as an appetizer my boyfriend ordered mussels, which weren't actually on the menu but they had them anyway. We didn't get our bread until the mussels came out and that was a bit of a wait. But when the mussels actually came out, they smelled like my dog, which was a little unsettling. They tasted fine though I guess. I think the worst part though was that when they brought out my water, there was a tiny dead bug in it. So that was pretty gross, I ended up taking my boyfriends water instead, then when they brought me a replacement water, there was like paper or something floating around in it. Sooo check your water before you drink it. One last thing, it was freezing cold in the restaurant.

But it was totally worth it!To start, you can bring in your own wine, and there is a wine and spirit shop conveniently located next door. We ordered the appetizer sampler and it was very good. I was most excited for the mozzarella sticks (homemade!), but these ended up being the weakest link of the meal. They were mostly all bread with very little cheese. The meatballs on the other hand more than made up for it, as they were top notch! The bruschetta was some of the best I have had, even though this is what I was looking the least forward to! I believe there was even some prosciutto on those bad boys!I ordered the chicken mimmosa which was scrumptious! Too bad at this point I was already mostly full so didn't make it too far into my entree. This is never a bad problem to have though!This might not be the *best* Italian place ever, but for a middle tier option, it is the bees knees!

It was also really weird how they brought out our food 2 or 1 at a time & it took a while until we all had our food. Not to mention that we all didn't get menus & it took a long time for her to take our order. Another annoying but about the crappy service is that one of the members of our party had a 3 year old & as soon swear river we asked for a high chair.

I have lived within a mile of Mama Mias for about five years now and never have once tried it until last night. I always heard good things from people throughout the community, but for some reason never stopped in to give them a chance. That is the bitter part of this review because I have been missing many years of wonderful Italian comfort food. Nonetheless, the sweet is the sweetest because my wife and I have a new favorite Italian restaurant. As we indulged in our meal we quickly realized we were experiencing something special. The food was perfectly executed. Not over salted, the right amount of cheese, and FRESH ingredients...this my friends are the keys to great Italian food. Do not be fooled by the other low ratings that were given for this restaurant...the will only deter you from the true definition of deliciousness. I understand everyone's pallet is different but realize that real Italian food is not \"Pizza Hut\". Fast food Italian is all preservatives, tons of salt and cheese, they do this to mask how bad the food is because cheese makes everything somewhat better. As for folks saying they were slow, that's incorrect. We were informed as soon as we were seated that all the food prepared is made from scratch so it takes a little longer. We were there 1 hour and five minutes with salads, two baskets of bread, mozzarella sticks for an app, our dinner courses, and finished a whole bottle of wine. Again, this is not fast food. This is a restaurant that produces quality, made from scratch food. I do not mind one taking a little extra time in preparing food in order to receive a quality product at the end. Trust me, do yourself a favor and try them out. I battled a while if I was going to write a review because I did not want anybody to know of this place, but it would not be a service to Mama Mias.

The bread with olive oil and herbs (and ideally balsamic vinegar too) theirs was fresh and hot, you could tell it was the same they use for the crust of the pizza, but thats ok, at least they presented it3.

I have heard great things about it, but, experienced the opposite tonight. My father owns restaurants and has taught me the importance of supporting family owned businesses but tonight this one puts family owned businesses to shame.I liked the intimate atmosphere. It is dimly lit and is great for a nice date night. After waiting for a while after placing our order, we received our salad (iceberg lettuce, a slice of tomato, carrots) and breadsticks (breadsticks were pretty good!). At this point, we were underwhelmed but still anticipating an amazing meal.And when I say anticipating...we anticipated a great meal for 25 minutes before we actually received our food. I ordered the Ravioli (can't remember the name but had a cream sauce with chicken and mushrooms) and my husband ordered the chicken marsala. When I received my meal, it was luke warm - the cheese that was supposed to be melted on top was hard...I typically do not send food back but I could not handle the fact that it had clearly been sitting out so I graciously sent it back to be heated up, recooked-whatever. When I received it back (within 3 minutes) it was obvious that it had just been microwaved to a molten lava temperature causing the chicken's texture to literally resemble plastic. I had about 3 bites - I could not handle it (I am the LEAST picky person in the world - if I won't eat something, you know it's bad). My husband's chicken marsala was soup. The sauce was runny and flavorless. He had about 3 bites. The server asked us if we wanted to go boxes and we declined. She paid no attention to the fact that we were clearly unsatisfied. As I said, my father owns restaurants, I understand there are mistakes and no one is perfect. But, the thing that bothered me was that we were not taken care of by any means. No manager came out to apologize for the 25 minute delay in our food - let alone apologize that mine came out nearly cold. This is the attention to detail patrons go to family owned businesses for.

I went last night thinking it might be OK to eat there when it's half empty. It is not. Walked in at around 7 PM for a table for two.

We were seated immediately with menus. 20 minutes later we were still sitting there. No water, no greeting, no nothing. Finally got some water and we ordered our meals. I got the Veal piccata, my friend got something that I don't even remember what it's called. Wide noodles with some sort of tomato sauce and goat cheese. 30 minutes after we ordered we got bread and we were invited to order salad dressing for our salad. Our waiter hyped up the bleu cheese as the best in the area. It is not. We were given one roll each and when I asked for more bread, I got a fairly mean look and a lot of talk about not eating too much bread. Really? Here's a tip waiter: Wait on us and shut up. 20 minutes after our salads we got our simple pasta meals. He set down our dishes and said he would be right back with cheese. My piccata was OK...nothing to write home about, but the noodles were al dente. The veal itself was not that great. Just a small to medium veal chop on top of some noodles. The wide noodles....nasty. The tomato sauce was super sweet, like Papa John's sweet. Anyways, my friend thought she'd wait for cheese to try to rescue her dish. 15 minutes pass. Nothing. I finally flag down somebody to get cheese, and he looks at our dishes like, \"Hold on there, I already put fucking cheese on your dish...\" and he gave me an annoyed look and a sigh before getting the cheese and grating some on our dishes. 2 hours, 1 water refill. Glass was empty for the majority of the time. Our waiter...wow. I tried to like him, but in the end he was just annoying and took forever. He had a \"charming\" accent, but in the end he spent most of the time talking to my female friend rather than addressing both of us, which I found super annoying. The restaurant is very tiny and he had no more than 4 parties at one time. No excuse. \u00a0The back breaker: 2 hours after we sit, we finally got a bill. There was an extra 6 dollar charge on the hand written check, for which I could find no reason. It was either for asking for cheese on our dishes or for the extra 2 rolls. Either that or he thought he had uncorked some wine for us. I didn't feel like dealing with it so I left what he asked for plus a tip. But that will be my last tip ever for them, because I am not going back. Summary: stingy with bread, stingy with water, time wasters. Too dark as well. Meal for two, no drinks just water.

I then asked what she had that was sugar free, and she said normally Diet Coke, but that the soda machine was broken. She said my only sugar free beverage choice was a glass of tap water. Definitely not a good way to start the meal at a restaurant that strives to be 'fine dining' with $15-20 dollar entrees.A male waiter then comes to our table asking to take our order before we had a chance to even look at the menu. We asked what he recommended and he said \"everything\". That did not help us narrow our selection.We both order the Siciliana with Bolognese (spaghetti with meat sauce), with a side of meatballs. The salad comes out and was fine. The dressing seemed to be store bought and not from scratch, but it wasn't a big deal. The garlic bread we received was stale and hard as if it had been reheated in the microwave a few too many times and was dripping in butter. We left it in the basket. Gross.The meal then arrives and we begin to eat. First off, they got the order entirely wrong - we ordered Bolognese sauce and they served it with Marinara sauce instead. The sauce was so sweet that my dinner companion said it tasted more like a dessert than a dinner entree! The meatballs were ok, but cold in the center as if they had been re-heated, and the pasta (which they told us was from scratch) was out of a box (yes, i can easily tell the difference).The entire experience reminded me of the Food Network show Sandra Lee/Semi Homeade. Its as if they were trying to be fine dining, but it was an epic failure.My dinner guest could not eat his meal because it had so much sugar in the sauce (and they put the wrong sauce on the pasta to begin with).

This was not a great experience for me. With out of town guests, a group of us decided to do a touristy brunch at the Listening Room Cafe. We came in around 10:30am with live music starting at 11:30am. Our table had about 7 people and the place was pretty empty with the exception of maybe 5 other tables (the place is pretty large).

They offer bottomless mimosas/bloody mary's for the reasonable price of $15.00 if I remember correctly. I did not partake but had a sip and they were pretty solid. Not all orange juice and mixed properly. That's where the good ends. We waited an hour for our food. Then they broke restaurant rule #1. They brought out 3 entrees and then we waited at least another 10-15 minutes before the rest of our table got their food. Seriously? No one had silverware either, so we had to wait be able to eat our brunch. I was very cranky at this point and starving. Much to my chagrin, I discovered that my veggie flatbread was not a pizza, but rather a clump of veggies and a tiny bit of hummus in a thick bland pita, and made like a sandwich. Huh? Since when does flatbread = sandwich? \u00a0On top of that it was bland and boring once I started eating. The bacon was OK and they brought out french fries anyway. Unfortunately, the poor food didn't stop there. The burger was just OK, the chicken and waffles had completely unseasoned and dry fried chicken that needed salt.

From the moment you walk in, you can feel the musical electricity. The stage is the real deal. It's not overly fancy; it's just legit. You know it when you see it. Other venues may have more cache, but the LRC is no slouch. If you're set to see a show here, be excited. Parking can be a bit of an issue but they have a (free?) valet. If Tom is working, he'll take good care of you and your vehicle.Since it's a music venue, one would hope the drink program is up to par. It is. I came here on a Wednesday night in early autumn and was on a red ale kick.

I wanted to try the watermelon drink that had moonshine or the Blowin' Smoke drink which had whiskey but the bartender told me both were pretty strong and, again, I needed to be coherent so...When the music's in between sets or you need to talk (don't ever talk during a performance), take your drink and hit the patio. There's not much of a view right now but once the amphitheater gets built up, you've got a game changer on your hands. The only real letdown is the food program. My Caesar salad was mealy and my portabella burger was cold & rubbery.

My husband also ordered the Mac and cheese, which was tasty, but a very small portion. The drinks were tasty, a little on the small side, but good. I had the watermelon crawl and it was delicious - they were out of watermelon, so they made it was pear juice. I guess I technically had a pear crawl, but still tasty! The music is AMZING.

When trying to find the right space in Nashville for our party, I stumbled across the Listening Room Cafe by pure chance but it was exactly the place I was looking for to host our event. The decoration is rustic interiors with brick background, wood beams and elevated ceilings. The sound system is amazing and they have a projector as well to use for tv or your own a-v hookups. There is also plenty of parking for your guests which is a HUGE plus in the downtown area considering there are parking lots at every turn and corner. The outdoor patio has a nice view of the Nashville skyline and is a great place to catch a drink on a cool evening. The Owner was a pleasure to work with and helped work through every little request I had. He even helped the kitchen prepare a custom menu with a authentic home recipe for our guests which came out incredible. We created a customized menu and bar menu for our guests and they were willing to accomodate all of my requests. \u00a0I especially enjoyed the local Yazoo beers on tap. I got to try a lot of the offerings on the menu and highly recommend the fried pickles, southern fried chicken, whiskey salmon, and broccoli casserole. \u00a0Our guests left the evening with an awesome and authentic Nashville experience and I even got on stage and played a song to close out the evening.

From what I gathered, there are a few \"shows\" each night. They seat for each showing, begin serving, and various musicians play for the next hour and a half to two hours. Our show was set to seat at 8:00 p.m., so the host told us we could either wait 15 minutes or so until the band wrapped up at the bar or outside on their large patio. We opted for outside, since the weather was beautiful. About 15 minutes later I walked over to the door where the host was standing. He commented that the band decided to play a little longer than scheduled. I jokingly said, \"Yeah - likely story,\" to which he responded with attitude that they were \"all just a bunch of music loving hippies around here who don't care much for time anyway.\" SCOFF! Just because I got dressed up that night doesn't mean he should assume that I'm not also a music-loving hippie without much care for time! I normally wouldn't be offended at that kind of remark, but it was his tone of voice when he said it that was offensive.Anyway.We went inside soon after this little incident and proceeded to ask him where we should sit, since it seemed there were reservations to consider. He said we could sit at any table where there were no people, so we headed for one near the stage and sat down. He didn't bring us menus, take our drink order or clear our table.About 15 minutes later, our waiter came. He was seemingly confused as to whether we had hung around from the previous show or if we had just been seated. We told him we just sat and he quickly cleared our table. He asked if we were seated there or if we chose it ourselves. We told him the host said to sit where ever we wanted (he said the host was supposed to seat us). He asked if we got menus or a drink order taken yet. We said neither (apparently the host was supposed to do both these things, too). Luckily, he quickly made up for the service the host was lacking. He brought us our two pints and appetizers relatively quickly, was hot on the water refills, and our entrees came not long after our appies.The show was great, too. I loved the format, having so many acts come on along with a host to tie everything together. All the performers did a great job and it was nice to see so much camaraderie among them - they all seemed to know each other and helped one another out during technical difficulties or if someone needed a fill-in percussionist, etc. It was more like a mini festival inside a super awesome music venue.For your NYers: the venue itself reminded me a lot of The City Winery. There are lots of tables and chairs, standing room near the back, and a decent-sized bar area.Despite the holier-than-thou host, I would still come back here for more great up-and-coming musicians and tasty food, too.

I made a reservation for $2 online and got a seat right up front by the stage. Worth it? Um...yes! It's not so much the decor that makes Listening Room amazing but it is the sheer amount of musical talent you're able to watch in Nashville which makes it completely worthwhile.I came here twice to watch songwriter rounds during the Tin Pan South Songwriters Festival and was blown away both times. It's amazing to listen to some of my favorite songs of all time (multiple #1 pop and country hits) sung by the people who took part in writing them. It's always been my dream to be a professional songwriter and having these live musical experiences makes it only more of a reality.My tips if you're deciding to watch a show at the Listening Room is to make reservations online. It's really easy and affordable to reserve seating with a full map of the venue. I wouldn't recommend sitting in the very front simply because the speakers are usually turned up pretty loud and you might go deaf. Instead opt for seating which is midway but still has a good view. The Listening Room is small so you can see the stage from pretty much any point in the room. Another tip is to eat somewhere else unless you enjoy bar food. I ate the beet salad one night which was not good at all, but found the chili to be pretty good the second night. Honestly I just don't think I'm cut out for Nashville fare in general because I'm such a picky eater. The food is a bit lackluster but the staff is very accommodating.

Really, it was that good. So let me tell the story. First, mad props to Yelp.com because this is the first restaurant that i have ever been to solely on the recommendation of this site. It was lunch time today and we were working in bell Meade and we were low on cash. In Richy rich-ville that means your options are limited. So i typed in the filter; cheap, close and good. this was the #1 result that popped up so off we went. I was their first customer of the day and was sat by the kitchen door. I knew i was in for an adventure when I immediately heard all the employees inside the kitchen give out a massive Aztec battle cry to start their shift. Then our waiter instantly appeared with chips and salsa. I was fully prepared to order their $6.00 lunch portion of fajitas when i tasted the salsa. \"WOW, this place may have some real potential\". That is what i thought when i decided to jump into the deep end of the menu and order the $12 palliadia mexicana fajitas. [sorry about spelling there]. It was wonderful. the churizzo was very spicy. the pork was very tender and the carney asada was not overdone. My friend also ordered the fiesta chicken and said it was awesome. I did not taste his food but the presentation was pretty with very festive use of red and green peppers. Our waiter did his job well by giving me at least 5 drink refills plus refills on the chips and salsa. the only negative was the food took 14 minutes to get to the table after we ordered it but i was understanding because they were just opening.

I live very close so I was excited to see a Mexican place that close to home when they opened.I can give a pretty fair review now that I have tried many items on the menu. \u00a0Fajitas - they're always good, with good quality meat, tender, juicy and flavorful. My favorite version is the Parillada Mexicana which comes with chorizo, chicken, steak, and shrimp and a carnita, along with the normal grilled veggies. \u00a0I will say that sometimes the carnita that comes with this is a bit dry and tough and sometimes the shrimp are overcooked, but overall this is still my favorite fajita dish. (When I say sometimes, I would say out of 7 orders it may have happened twice)The normal carnitas however are always top notch. I think the difference may be that the carnita on the fajita plate gets a bit of extra cooking time being in with the fajita mix and on that hot griddle plate)They also have a spinach burrito dish that is excellent if you're vegetarian. It's creamy and rich with cheese. It comes with two and is great with a guacamole salad. (lettuce, tomato, guac)I also enjoy the fish tacos, they are not fried but grilled and have a nice kick to them. If you want it HOT like I do, you can ask them to cook the fish in the diablo sauce which to me, is still not \"set you on fire\" hot, but others would disagree. I have a pretty high threshold for what most would consider hot.For a different type of lunch I ordered the Huevos Con Chorizo (Eggs with Mexican sausage) which comes with rice and beans, and found it to be great! \u00a0Light because of the eggs, but extremely tasty due to the chorizo being scrambled with the eggs.Their guacamole and salsas are always very fresh as well as the chips.Tequila's does a great job of offering the standard Mexican fare those in the US are accustomed to, but also has some items that lean more towards authentic Mexican. The one thing that is missing from the menu (and usually is on most Mexican joints) is a good Mole. \u00a0If they could add a good Mole chicken dish, I would be in heaven. \u00a0As I've said in previous reviews I'm a bit stingy with stars so very few joints get 5 from me, but Tequilas has always been a solid 4.They have a great and friendly staff, the food is never disappointing, and their prices are very reasonable. You can eat for under $10 easily, or you can get a large meal for between $10.00 and $16.00.If you live in, or are close to West Nashville, it's by far the best Mexican place you can find.

Of course, there's plenty of TexMex and Americanized Mexican food available in Nashville too, and I happen to think that's a good thing. Sometimes you just want to eat something that's slathered in cheese sauce, am I right? U.S. Border Cantina used to be our go-to spot for Mexican food when I was craving queso and margaritas, but now that it's gone to the restaurant graveyard in the sky, Tequila's is our new haunt when we're in the mood for Meximerican (a term of my own creation) food. I think most of these \"Mexican\" restaurants are pretty interchangeable, but Tequila's food is legitimately very tasty (the fajita burrito is enough for two, though it's so yummy you won't want to share) and has lightning fast service. Additionally, while it doesn't serve the best margaritas I've ever had, it does offer up decent incarnations of them, and for a reasonable price, too. For $6.50, you can get a top-shelf marg that will seriously rev your engine. Better yet, they have plenty of drink specials, including $15 margarita pitchers on the weekend (and they're even cheaper during the week), which makes getting your tequila fix all the easier.So not authentic by any means, but still good in its own right.

It's either too ripe and I can't eat it or it's fresh and I can't stop. I didn't stop until his was gone. I also liked that the condiments were served in tiny fried tortilla bowls. Ate most of that too. I opted for the grilled fish tacos (duh) and husband ordered the veggie burrito. Fish tacos were alright but sadly they just use bagged corn tortillas and don't make their own. Halfway through the second taco, I had to eat with a fork because it was falling apart. I really liked their beans. Rice was really bland so I didn't eat more than a bite or two.

Also, their food is incredible. I've been to Rosepepper several times since I moved to Nashville in 2012, but my culinary experience tonight warranted a review, and a favorable one at that. First off, get a margarita. Don't let your friends talk you into getting a Corona or, god forbid, a Miller Lite. Get a margarita. Their house margarita is excellent, and the specialty margaritas are quite good, as well (I'm a bit partial to the Jala-pi\u00f1a-rita (jalape\u00f1o-infused tequila)). They're always made fresh to order, and *clear* (i.e, made with tequila and lime juice, not margarita mix). Trust me, don't miss out on this. That would be like failing to vote or going to Wal-Mart on purpose or eating McDonald's right after eating McDonalds. Don't be that kind of human.Next, get the homemade guacamole. Don't ask any other questions, just get it. It's fresh, it's spicy, it's delicious, and it comes with fried tortilla chips (like regular chips, but fried (aka better)). Combine this with the margaritas you just ordered and the complimentary salsa trio, and you're well on your way to a good time (which I hope you're sharing with others; if you're by yourself, call me and I'll come meet you). Now, the food is where I leave you to your own devices. People like what they like and I'm not here to be the Ghandi to your search for meaning. I'll just tell you what I like. The mole carnitas. Houston, I repeat, the mole carnitas. The holy mole carnitas. Let me break it down for you like this: steaming, pull-apart pork, perfectly seasoned, alongside pico de gallo and avocado; to the side is rice and black beans; in the aluminum foil are your piping hot corn tortillas (i.e., heaven). In a little cup on your plate is the mole sauce. And it's not like mole you've had before. No chocolate wanna-be's here. This is delectably spicy *pecan* mole sauce. It has a superb balance of nuttiness, heat, and depth that make you want to tilt your overwhelmed head back and drink it. I think world leaders are bathed in this stuff as children. When I tasted it, my wife told me my eyes closed and I went to my little food heaven for a minute. Am I exaggerating? Would I use a word like \"superb\" or \"delectably\" if I was? See? I answered your question with a question. Call me Socrates. Hopefully you still have some of your margarita (or second one) left to wash these homemade carnitas tacos down. When I first tasted the multi-layered goodness of tortilla, black bean, carnitas, pico, avocado, and mole, I had to take a (figurative) step back and contemplate my life. After that, I relished each bite. And when you realize that your whole meal was only $24 (margarita + dinner + 1/2 guacamole), then it's even more worth it. I think I actually sang \"Baby You're Worth It\" to my plate of food (and much to my wife's chagrin). So, take my advice, or don't. But here, that's like saying \"buy health insurance, or don't,\" or \"marry the girl of your dreams, or don't.\" Anyway, you get the picture. Go forth and enjoy.

We finally ordered about 20 minutes after being seated and I asked for extra silverware as there wasn't enough at the table.Yet another 20-25 minutes pass and finally everyone's food arrives.

The large room is cobbled together into odd little sections. Christmas tree lights, sheer panel curtains (or shower curtains) adorned with purple lights, and chandeliers are hung haphazardly.

The chips were good, homemade I believe. I'm not sure who penned the marquee, but if they truly think those salsas are hot, we have vastly different taste in men. Hot they were not; two were incredibly mild and one just barely passable for medium.

On my most recent visit, I was struck by a stale energy and musty smell.Nowadays, the employees, from hostesses to servers, seem burned out and to have lost their collective charm. The bartenders still seem friendly, though.Menu-wise, even their trio of complimentary salsas isn't as good as it used to be. The salsas were bland, lacking seasoning. I ordered the \"buffalo white cheese dip\" (i.e. chori queso) which came with maybe a teaspoon of rendered chorizo crumbles on the top. I felt ripped off.In my opinion, there are only two things worth ordering here:1.) For drinks, the skinny margarita (i.e. a real margarita, made with tequila, fresh lime juice, and triple sec). At $9 for a pint (YES, a pint) on the rocks, I found this to be both delicious and a good deal.2.) For food, the chile verde. Their very spicy pork green chile stew is served in a bowl, accompanied with rice, refried beans, a charred jalape\u00f1o, and (average) flour tortillas. This hearty bowl of spicy comfort food will do the trick when you're not feeling well.Knowing exactly what I like here and considering only the margarita and chile verde, I'd be more inclined to give 3 stars (probably 4 back in the day).

When I asked, \"And the other taco?\" she said, \"Oh....you wanted two tacos?\"I was very tempted to ask her to actually pick up one of the menus, flip to the \"taco\" section and ask her to read the ONLY THREE OPTIONS.

The air-conditioning/electricity went out before we had even gotten our meal. I get it - we did have a very hot summer in Nashville last summer and the A/C was being overworked. It was still a bad experience and I never want to sweat that much in a Mexican restaurant again. Bad Experience #2: I was there in the evening for a small birthday party. Dinner was over, we were leaving. It was around 8pm. A girl (who I didn't know) threw up all over my back and the floor as I was exiting the building - not the restaurant's fault, but still a bad experience none-the-less. I never want to be thrown up on in a Mexican restaurant again.Bad Experience #3: Again, here for a friend's birthday dinner earlier this month. Our party was for 16, though originally when the reservation was made it was 14, so we upped the numbers (by two) and let them know. We waited an hour and a half to be seated (no biggie - we had a big party, we understood). So finally they were ready to seat us. There were two seats missing, so my boyfriend and I asked for two more seats. The host was a little short with us, asked us if we had let them know that it was supposed to be 16 and not 14 - we said yes (because, yes, we did let them know). She made zero effort to find a small table to add to the end and told us that we had to sit on the corners as she handed us chairs. Basically we ate our food in our laps. And, I would also like to add that the bathrooms were not clean (messes on the floor - it was just gross.)The food - not memorable.

Keep that in mind through the rest of my review, because it's probably going to sound more negative than it should.This is not a typical Mexican restaurant, by any means. In East Nashville fashion, Rosepepper emphasizes trendiness, which results in higher prices and a small hint of pretentiousness. This is most apparent by the sticker that graces the front of every menu:\"Your first round of chips and salsa is on us. Refills: Chips $2.00 Salsa $1.00 ea.\" Call me old fashioned, but that's the ONE thing that a Mexican restaurant can do to annoy me. I've put up with bad service at plenty of them. But to charge for extra chips and salsa borders on absurdity. Oh, and the sticker has a big, condescending smiley face on there, as if that makes it okay.The service was actually pretty good. Not super attentive, and our margaritas took a while to come out, but nothing was particularly bad. The food all came out right and relatively quickly, each of which is a minor miracle at many Mexican restaurants. But like I said, the food was great. Overprice, sure, but delicious, nonetheless. I don't mind paying extra for good food, but is this really twice as good as any of the places on Nolensville? Fancier, sure; better, no. The margaritas, however, were noticeably better than most - something that's actually worth the price increase. And despite my frustration with them, the chips and salsa were great.

The heartburn inducing, aforementioned mix is the norm, and shouldn't be. It's lazy and disparages the good name of Margarita, wherever she may be. If you care about decor in a Mexican restaurant, I dont think you are Mexican food material. Christmas lights year round, sombrero's and cheap church fellowship hall chairs are the standard set here.

(Rosepepper's explanation of my criticizing the unspicy \"hot\" sauce might be that their focus is on Sonora-style Mexican cuisine, which is in nature not spicy. \u00a0Eh, whatever.) \u00a0Really, it was maybe the best thing I ate. \u00a0The verde salsa was syrupy and extremely mild, and maybe too sweet. \u00a0And the mild salsa - could hardly pass as salsa. \u00a0It was tomato paste with a few herbs and spices.We had a casa margarita and a frozen peach margarita. \u00a0These margaritas are HARDCORE. \u00a0Lots of alcohol. \u00a0They're \u00a0well made and homemade. \u00a0However, if you're lookin' for a real sweet concoction, I'd hit Cantina Laredo first. \u00a0And ladies go on Ladies Night Thursdays when the margaritas are $6.We had the fish tacos and a combination plate including a bean chimichanga and chicken taco. \u00a0Chimiganga was a cute burrito-sized fried pocket filled with yummy beans and topped with a Buffalo cheese sauce. \u00a0Yummy, it's hard to go wrong with an item like this - especially for me, because I love beans. \u00a0I know it sounds funny, but I really do. \u00a0The chicken taco was really bland. \u00a0Flavorless! \u00a0Well cooked and well, but totally without any character. \u00a0Fish tacos were well battered, and accompanied by a tangy mayo sauce. \u00a0Did I mention tangy??This may be the most amusing part of my meal. \u00a0The combination \u00a0platter was accompanied by \"lime veggies\". \u00a0Sounds like an over-complimentary description for what came out on the plate, which was clearly raw carrots, cucumber, and celery. \u00a0Uh, nice try.You know, it's a cool place with a varied menu. \u00a0I know it's a really hip hang, any restaurant with the cheapest margarita priced at $8 would be. \u00a0But honestly from my experience tonight, I wouldn't come here again. \u00a0The service was plenty fine and the setting was fine, but the food just wasn't good enough.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 295 reviews", "date": "2010-04-12"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nHeather H.\n", "review": "Rosepepper is a cool little joint with an offbeat vibe, good music, and a tempting drink menu.

The tacos were decorated with cilantro and the chicken appeared blackened, but it was virtually tasteless. The chimi had a small amount of cheese sauce filming on top which was the only thing complementing the chicken (no peppers of any kind on my dish). The margaritas were another story. Beware of the house margarita (even top shelf)--it tends to taste like sweet hard candy as if they use Gatorade instead of lime juice.

We went to Rosepepper this past weekend to celebrate one of my bridesmaid's birthdays and had a blast. Since there were 11 of us, we had to wait for some tables out on the heated patio to free up. To kill some time while the rest of the party showed up and while taking in eclectic decorations designed to hide some structural issues (not sure what this place was before a restaurant but there's some odd heating and plumbing work running throughout), we ponied up to the bar area and ordered some house margaritas which were delicious. The bar itself has a cumbersome layout making it difficult for the bartenders to serve drinks in an efficient manner (think of it as 3 people stuffed into an area meant for one person), so at busy times drinks are a bit slow - but they are definitely worth the wait. We were seatedfairly quickly once all of our group arrived and were treated to tons of chips and three types of salsa. Two of the salsas were a bit runny that night, but I'm not going to look down on free chips and salsa. Our waitress arrived and deftly took our orders while keeping our gullets gushing with libation. We ordered some avocado fries which weren't my favorite way to eat avocados but my fianc\u00e9 was digging them. I ordered the fajita burrito which in all honesty wasn't anything special. My fianc\u00e9 on the other hand had the dish that I would want again and again - Sonora Style Enchilada. It was spicy, delicious and that verde chili sauce with fried egg to boot was great (I'm glad he shared a little because I'm not sure if I would have).

Since living in East Nashville since '07 I have eaten here many time with fairly consistent results each time. The chips are always fresh and crispy and the three varieties of salsa (mild, hot, and tomatillo-the best one) are always a nice way to start your meal. Their cheese dip is REALLY good and has a little chorizo on top for a little extra flavor and spice. the guacamole is good, but nothing extraordinary. Both the cheese dip and guacamole do come with these deliciously sinful and puffy fried flour tortilla chips that are a nice change from the corn tortilla chips that accompany the salsas. \u00a0Definitely cool off with one...or three of their delicious margaritas to enjoy with your meal. My personal favorite is the original one, but the pineapple one is a close second. I tried the peach, but it wasn't as flavorful and peachy as I expected, so I wouldn't recommend that one if a lot of flavor is what you're after. Once the chips, dips, and margaritas have you nice and primed, it's time for the entrees. My personal favorites are the mixed grill fajitas, fish tacos, and my very favorite, the Rosepepper Special. The fajitas won me over because they keep the vegetables nice and crunchy without using a lot of oil. Most places bring out your fajitas and you are staring at a sizzling platter full of oil and greasy, overcooked veggies. Not here. I also like to get the chicken and steak mixed so that there is some variety.Not to mention, the shrimp fajitas are also a winner. The fish tacos are really good and can be fried or grilled, depending on your mood/willpower. The grilled ones are good, but let's be real, you are getting the fried ones because they are awesome! A generous piece of fish, fried golden and crispy, fresh cabbage, and a wonderfully creamy and cool crema to top all of that yumminess, all wrapped up in a toasted corn tortilla. Now the Rosepepper Special is not for everyone, especially for the faint of heart...or should I say heat. Tis dish consists of two enchilada with your choice of chicken or shredded beef, then topped with a mouth melting verde pork salsa that is out. of. this. world. Cue the margaritas being quickly refilled because this one will set you ablaze, but I love spicy food and don't mind breaking a little sweat to enjoy this.....but you must love hot food to make it through this experience. One of my favorite things about Rosepepper is the variety of sides. Not only do they offer the typical refried beans and rice, they also offer black beans or Sonora vegetables (a sauteed mix of corn, onions, peppers, and cactus) as a nice change from the typical. One of my least favorite things about Rosepepper is the hit and miss service. Sometimes you go and feel like a prince, other times, a pauper. The servers are usually nice and attentive, but sometimes you get Mr. or Ms. Moodypants and the refills and general duties fall by the wayside.

The chips were good, the salsas were very tasty I particularly liked the salsa verde and took a small amount with me for my leftovers. The only downside was the chicken was a tad bit bland. The quality was definitely there, appeared to be shredded breast meat rather than a hodge podge of fat and dark meat that you may find at other places, but it lacked a bit of seasoning. I would have been elated if it had more flavor, overall though it was a good meal. Our service was exceptional. The waitress was very attentive, friendly and accommodating to our 13 month old Son. She brought him water with a lid and straw, and when placing hot plates on the table was careful to place everything out of his reach. This is a huge deal breaker for us as Parents.I like that this is situated in the East End area near Ugly Muggs and other East Nash favorite, but I dare say that is why you will notice the slightly steeper prices.

What I find unique in relation to other Nashville Tex Mex joints is that they use black beans and it comes with salsa, guac, and sour cream in tortilla bowls (rather than actually on top of the nachos). Another variation are the heavy flour tortilla chips that almost remind me more of a pita than a chip. They serve these with the guac as well.

I might hit this place up for margaritas, but not neccessarily for food. just have the margaritas and their chips and you'll be good, but stay from everything that i've mentioned above.one more note, my friends that had the fajitas and the carnes asada tacos seemed to like their food. =]", "location": "\nLos Angeles, CA\n", "exp": " 85 reviews", "date": "2007-05-17"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nSusan K.\n", "review": "I love the Rosepepper.

I used to think this place was wonderful and have hosted many gatherings, had a few first dates, and too many margaritas here. That is until my most recent experience. I've moved out west- Seattle to be exact, a city not lacking in great restaurants, especially Mexican- and wanted to have my last meal in town with my family and closest friends at The Rose Pepper. I called days in advance- 5 days to be exact- and asked to make a reservation for 7 for a Friday night. This action I feel is as much a stress-reliever for me and my party as it is for the establishment- what restaurant wants a large party to show up with no warning on a weekend night [their website states that they accept reservations]? The man who answered my call said that all reservations must be approved by a manager. I can handle that. He also said that technically reservations are only for parties of 8 or above. I said I could make it for 8 then and would just invite another person. He said he would put us down in the books and I should hear from the manager the following day. By the next day's end, I hadn't heard word. I called again and was informed that there was no record of my reservation. The woman that answered this time gave me the same spiel and took my info. Except that she already had my info. Which confused me, as I thought there was no record of my reservation...still confused about that one. Anyways, the woman said, even though she'd probably be \"fired\", that she'd make my reservation without the manager's consent. Whatever gets us a table. So the manager calls on Friday, the day of my dinner, basically saying that she technically cannot uphold my reservation since she had no prior knowledge [not my fault, right?], but will do me a \"favor\" and \"allow\" my party our table, as long as all *8* of us are there ten minutes *prior* to our reservation time. Excuse me? I called The Rosepepper, right? And not The Palm? Nobu? I mean, I'm awfully sorry Rosepepper to have so inconvenienced you with my courtesy of making a reservation for EIGHT margarita drinking adults. I'll be sure to never do this again. And to tell all my rather Nashville savvy friends to stay clear of this, let's face it, mediocre quasi-Mexican mess. Taco Mamacita is much better [and cleaner] anyways. Regardless, I canceled my reservation [still confused as to whether if I had shown up at 7 if we would've been served...] and went to THE YELLOW PORCH.

All the menus and wall decorations have Guy Fieri's face all over it. The show specifically showed the stuffed pork chops (which we both wanted) and starved from a full day. So appetizers consisted of smoked sausage and linked boudin. They were out of the Boudin Balls. \u00a0Smoked Sausage was too sauced. It just points to the meat not being either 1) cooked well 2) not of good quality hence NEEDING the sauce to overpower the flavor. The linked Boudin was good, i was a little taken confused on how to eat the linked Boudin but it was delicious none the less. Then the pork chops came - dripping in BBQ sauce. It takes away from the meat. It looked so good on the show and although it tasted good it wasn't THAT good. And not for $14.95 each. The fight broke out shortly after our waitress got a phone call while walking around the restaurant from someone and started screaming about house keys and \"being done with this sh**\".

When you walk up, you may be tempted to think that you are about to enter a shady business that is a front for something else. \u00a0To us, this added to the interest. \u00a0When we walked in, there was one person just finishing a meal, and the hostess told us we could sit where we wanted. \u00a0We selected a table near the counter, which is basically like an old lunch-style buffet with all the sides / etc. in pans behind a glass divider. \u00a0We opted to try a few things from the menu, the cajun sausage, the boudin balls and the all-u-can-eat catfish. \u00a0I have to say, from the moment the first item arrived until the last, it was a fantastic meal. \u00a0They didn't spend extra money on decorations, high rent or trendy looks, but rather put their money where their mouth is and made amazingly delicious food. \u00a0The spices were just right, the boudin balls were killer, and the catfish was lightly breaded, spicy and some of the best I've had. \u00a0Also, don't go there unless you plan to eat, as there is a TON of food in each serving. \u00a0Some places have all-u-can-eat and its designed to give you a decent first portion, then the subsequent portions get smaller / longer to arrive and don't taste as good. \u00a0Completely the opposite here. \u00a0Our second helping of catfish was double the size of the initial order, and as good if not better than the first. \u00a0Oh, and the hushpuppies were moist and packed with flavor. \u00a0I would recommend this place as a fun, casual / dress-down place to get a surprisingly good meal. \u00a0As we were leaving, 3 more people showed up, but otherwise was nearly empty (their main business is apparently lunch). \u00a0I would suggest going for dinner and make sure your belt has a few extra holes.", "location": "\nAcworth, GA\n", "exp": " 5 reviews", "date": "2014-09-05"}, {"rating": "1.0", "name": "\nJim B.\n", "review": "Very Disappointing!!!

An old building with rambling rooms of old tables and chairs. The appearance does not give a sense of sanitation, but that doesn't really bother me; it just makes me wonder how a place like this cannot be flagged by a health inspector of fire inspector for that matter.Definitely home style cooked food here complete with a Cajun cook that looks and speaks like he is very unhappy (Chef Breaux was not there). At least I think I saw him cooking...but also taking orders with no personality whatsoever. The girls/ladies of Bro's are all sweet and very nice.I was so excited to eat here. Finding real Cajun Boudin is impossible in my home state of Virginia unless you have it shipped or make it yourself, so of course I had to order it here. Unfortunately the Boudin at Bro's was not that good this day. I have made much better Boudin myself at home, and I have also had the best. I wont identify \"the best\" in case this site has a policy about referring to other establishments. I also ordered the gumbo. I was good, but not great. Once again, I have made gumbo at home that blows this away. The smoked sausage in the gumbo was also good, but did not seem authentic to me. The real Louisiana smoked sausage I have had is more coarse and natural in texture than what was in this gumbo. \u00a0Bro's is more pink and more like a commercial smoked sausage you would buy in a supermarket.I also ordered fried frogs legs. Again, virtually no flavor. They do not add any spices to their flour apparently...or the frog legs. They were not terrible, just not really flavorful at all...bland and boring.My wife ordered the shrimp po boy. She said the bread (appeared to be a baguette) was fantastic, but like my frogs legs (I tasted a bite of her shrimp) there was zero seasoning. Her sandwich was good she said, but the shrimp was unremarkable. The sandwich was made in two halves that were nearly impossible to join in to one cohesive sandwich, but all in all it was good.My wife also optioned for the cucumber salad as her side. She said it was OK...but yet again, my homemade cucumber salad blows it away. I guess I'm a better cook that I thought!All in all, Bro's has some decent home-style food...but it weren't no trip to \"flavor town\" for us.

Imagine my surprise when I got to the register and saw they had upped the price of a full slab to $25.99. \u00a0This was shown on a post-it note, at the register, and had been covered by some knick-knack. \u00a0The waiter failed to mention that the price of a full slab had gone up. \u00a0Furthermore, imagine my shock when I was charged $14.99 TWICE on my bill. \u00a0That's right. \u00a0They charged me $29.98 for a full slab, not the $25.99 the post it note had said.My card had been ran at this time when my wife noticed the discrepancy in price. \u00a0She brought it to the attention of the cashier who said she would get it worked out. \u00a0Out came the owner and said \"well, it's a heat up fee\". \u00a0Not really sure what that meant, as I was taking my leftovers home anyway. \u00a0The lady hastily tried to explain to me that there's some sort of unwritten \"warm up fee\" attached to ribs. \u00a0She said \"since its only a couple of dollars difference, how about we let this slide for the confusion?\" \u00a0I responded by telling her I didn't appreciate the \"miscommunication\" of their menu's, post-it's, and \"fee's\" that aren't on the menu. \u00a0In the end, my card had already been charged and the fee will stand. \u00a0I just know this was my second and last time at bro's because of this.So to sum it up: \u00a0food is good, service is lousy. \u00a0Make sure you get the current prices before you order and scrutinize your bill.", "location": "\nColumbia, TN\n", "exp": " 7 reviews", "date": "2012-01-14"}, {"rating": "3.0", "name": "\nBrent E.\n", "review": "Location and restaurant decor definitely meet \"Dive\" criteria.

Laziness prohibits that from being a everyday/every plate occurrence.No you have not found that special hole in the wall joint that has great food. This place is just dirty. When I found this place online, read reviews and watched the tv spot my mouth watered for weeks for that stuffed pork chop and the smoke sausage.

The wall was open to a kitchen that looked to be finishing up for the day at 11:30am. As soon as we were seated our drink order was taken and brought, but we never got menus or silverware. The next contact was several minutes later with \"so have you decided yet\". No big worry I have a stuffed chop on my mind, no long menu decisions here. Wife had a veggie plate, and we tasted a sausage app. The pork chop was dry like beef jerky. It had to be cook way prior and just reheated for me. The flavor and smoke was great. I'm disappointed I couldn't taste this the way it is supposed to. A choice of side is fried green tomato, you get two small one. One of mine was the top of the tomato, all skin. The cornbread is bland, unless your a fan of \"hot water\" style cornbread. The only thing I enjoyed was the smoke and spice.Just when I think it can't get much worse. I take my ticket to the cashier. She announces $34.63. Whooaa what. I grab a menu and open it up on the counter, and show her the chop is $12.95 not $14.95. She closes it and says the menu is wrong. She said \"every room has a sign that says notice of price change\". I did see a hand written sign on my way saying that. I assume the price on the menu is the new price, and regulars need to take notice of such. I asked why the waitress can't warn me of the typo on my menu. How about you mark out all prices and write in new ones? You really haven't raised your prices, at this point your just taking advantage of people at the register. She says, \"We'll have new menus in about three weeks\". Their menu is a white piece of printer paper. Black and white. Mine had color from food all over it, and was wrinkled like it was in the rain. With a printer paper menu, how do you not have new fresh clean menus every time. Lazy, that is how. Three weeks to print and copy a double sided sheet of paper. Here is what I think happens at Bros. They get there in the morning and cook like crazy. They cook the whole days worth, and wrap plastic over the metal pans. You order then they just reheat and serve.

Sure it's not a place for bettys watching their calories, but i think that's kinda obvious by the time you see the building, which is also awesome. Anyways if you make it here you're stoked, period. Don't believe the anti-hype, this is the real deal, and that dude talking about heart-blackening stuff is a total wuss, don't even let that fade ya. Not to mention Breaux himself, one of the coolest peeps around. Let me know if yall get an export biz going, i'll support you.

Bro's does have posted hours, but don't bank on them too much. I think they are more like suggestions, or perhaps just a guide to when they may or may not be open. I know it's an idiosyncrasy typical of such places, but after diligently trying to eat there for the past year or so, I now just find it annoying. During the week, Bro's is only open until three, so if you work, just plan to go on a Friday when they are (mostly) open until seven.That issue aside, the gumbo was great, served with probably the best cornbread I've ever had. The rice is served on the side, so you add it yourself. Bro's has daily specials, but their fixed menu is limited, so if you're not keen on what they have that day, just try the gumbo. The night I went this happened to me, but five minutes after I ordered, the waitress added a crab and shrimp stew to the specials and I was a little miffed because I would have ordered that. I was even more miffed when someone else did and it looked fabulous. So before you order, ask if they have anything that's not listed on the board. Bro's might be better on my second visit when I know how to order there and I'm more used to their menu. The staff are really friendly and the cook will talk to you while he's cooking.", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 357 reviews", "date": "2008-08-02"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nBilly C.\n", "review": "Had lunch at one of my favorite places in Nashville today, \u00a0Bro's! \u00a0Not much on atmosphere but if you want some good cookin then it's your place! \u00a0I ordered the Gumbo which had both chicken & Andouille sausage over rice. \u00a0The \"rue\" was dark and full of flavor. \u00a0The chicken was tender and the Andouille has a slight amount of heat! \u00a0Very good, very filling! \u00a0I also had a 1 lb, side of Crawfish. \u00a0Tons of flavor! \u00a0I wanted to stay and order more and make an afternoon of it but you know....gotta bet back to the Grind! \u00a0As always it was full at lunch time. \u00a0The layout is crazy and as I said the decor is bare minimum. \u00a0Darrell Breaux is always there with a quick joke and a smile. \u00a0The service is sometimes slow but today it was quick (except for the Crawfish)...but they arrived shortly behind the Gumbo. \u00a0I left with a full stomach and an empty pocketbook! \u00a0It's a bit pricy for lunch but well worth it IMHO! \u00a0I can't wait to return. \u00a0Hope to see you there!", "location": "\nNashville, TN\n", "exp": " 16 reviews", "date": "2012-02-16"}, {"rating": "2.0", "name": "\nSusan T.\n", "review": "For Thaksgiving we got a deep fried turkey and some of their andouille dressing. \u00a0The pale carcass they presented me with didn't hardly look cooked, much less deep fried, but I figured looks could be deceiving so I took it. \u00a0It was the worst turkey I have ever tasted and was as under cooked as it appeared. The dressing was made with what tasted like Jiffy cornbread mix and no sage at all. \u00a0I understand that recipes differ but now I know why all my Baton Rouge/NOLA relatives love my dressing so much!! I think the sweet cornbread must be a Cajun thing cause my Cajun husband says he never had good cornbread till he moved to Nashville. \u00a0I also bought some tasso for seasoning and it was very good though frozen at the time of purchase. \u00a0With tax, my total was just over $80 which I feel all but the tasso was wasted. \u00a0Never again, sorry.", "location": "\nMt Juliet, TN\n", "exp": " 1 review", "date": "2011-11-27"}, {"rating": "4.0", "name": "\nC R.\n", "review": "Excellent down home cajun food.
