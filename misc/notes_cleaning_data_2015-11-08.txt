Notes on cleaning data - 2015-11-08 (Ravi)

Data was cleaned and saved as data.table in two Rdata files:
- yelp_data.Rdata
- tripadvisor_data.Rdata

Issues encountered along with solutions: 

1) A small number of user reviews in the Yelp data set were broken up into multiple rows. This was likely caused by a newline or EOF character in the user review text data. Since this was a very rare event, these user reviews were skipped. (Example: observations 5418-5419  in yelp_dc_2_cleaned_features both correspond to the same review.)

2) For TripAdvisor, the mean by restaurant aggregation variables were not created in the first phase of the project. So, these were created now. 

3) For TripAdvisor, as we noticed earlier on, many of the user reviews do not have a location (or have an unrecognized location) and therefore are missing data for the user_is_local variable. I have ommitted these observations, since we are focusing on local vs. non-local.
